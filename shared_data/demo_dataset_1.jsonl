I have never heard him make a speech. I am with him all the time. He talk. That was a very good speech. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you, [PERSON]. Thank you very much. I appreciate. So we are here and we start. We begin and I want to thank [GPE] for the warm welcome outside. There are [CARDINAL] of people. I do not know if you have seen them, but they are all And no negatives, all positives and it is really beautiful and it is so great welcome and I am thrilled to be back at this beautiful state that we all love and so near and dear to my heart. I want to take [TIME] to salute your incredible outgoing chairman. [PERSON], what a job you have done. You really got [inaudible [TIME]]. [PERSON], stepping up. [CARDINAL] terms outstanding service to [ORG] and [PERSON], just congratulations on a job well done. He worked so hard. He loves the state, he loves the people of the state and we all love you [PERSON], and that is why I am going to be making an announcement about [PERSON]. Should I do it or should I just leave it? I am also so really excited to do this because I know so many people and so many people would like to do it, but [PERSON] is going to be stepping down and he will be coming on board as the senior advisor for my [GPE] campaign. He is going to help us to ensure that we have a win in the granite state in [DATE]. We stop the communist, we stopped the [NORP]. If we do not stop them this time, I think that is going to be the end. I really do. I believe that. I believe that we have to stop them and we have to stop them quickly. Now, although your next state chairman has not been announced, I believe they are going to be doing that right after this. I want to congratulate both candidates, [PERSON] and [PERSON], [CARDINAL] incredible guys for having the courage to step forward and serve. You will be hearing about that shortly. Let me also thank the [GPE] house speaker, [PERSON]. [PERSON], nice looking guy. Central casting, very good. He is really [ORG] majority leader, [PERSON]. [PERSON]. [PERSON]. Hi [PERSON]. How are you? Thank you. Great job, [PERSON]. Deputy [ORG] majority leader, [PERSON]. [PERSON]. Hello [PERSON]. You know they are shy politicians. That means they do their job. The ones that are not shy, they do not do their job, they'd sit down. They do not have to get up because everyone knows the great job they have done. Thank you very much. Great job all of you. [ORG] majority leader, [PERSON]. [PERSON], [PERSON]. Thank you [PERSON]. Great job, [PERSON], and executive counselor, [PERSON]. [PERSON], thank you. Thank you very much. As someone who has won the [GPE] presidential primary, not once but twice. And by the way, I believe we also won [CARDINAL] general elections. Okay? If you want to know the truth. And I believe it very strongly in plenty of other places also, but I know better than anybody what a special role the state has, the people have. And really it is a place for [NORP] presidents. And one of the things [PERSON] told, I told him, [PERSON], you can help with the campaign a little bit, but what I really want is help on [DATE] of voting. It used to be [DATE] right with paper ballots. Now it is in some cases [DATE]. How about that? We have [DATE] to vote and we have all machines. We have no paper, we have no nothing and lots of surprises. I said, I really want the biggest help to be on [DATE] or election period. Think of that, we have to call it an election period. Someday we will be back to paper ballots. We will be back to voter ID. We will be back to doing it the way it is supposed to be, [DATE] voting. In [GPE], they had an election, it was [DATE]. They had [CARDINAL] people that took [DATE]. By [TIME], all the votes were counted. You had a winner, you had a loser. And everybody said, Good luck. See you next time. But we do not have that in this country anymore. We have gone crazy in so many ways, but that is why from the very beginning I have strongly defended [GPE] first in the nation primary status. I have been your defender. No, I have been your defender and I have refused to let any [NORP]. And there are some, you know who they are, even think about taking that cherish status away. It is a cherish status. And they wanted to take it away. And we said, No, we are not going to do it. You see what is going on with the [NORP]? They taken lots of things away. And believe me, there are so many people looking to do harm to and generally no reason. You have an incredible tradition and we are going to keep that tradition and we guarantee it. And I said it last time and I said at the time before, and I have lived up to that promise just as I have many other promises. So you have it, you are first and you are going to remain first. Okay? But if you look just to try and compare and look on the other hand, lost the [GPE] primary, [PERSON] lost it badly and it was a very tough time. He had a humiliating fifth place to feed, and now he is taken a revenge on the voters of your state by cruelly and disgracefully trashing this beloved political tradition. It is a great tradition and I hope you are going to remember that during the general election. Do not worry about it now, just general election, you are going to remember that that he took it away. He took it away. He is going someplace else. You know about that. Now, maybe that'll be stopped legally or through the courts. I do not know. But he wants to take it away from [GPE]. I stand before you [DATE] and make this solemn pledge. When I am back in [FAC], I will ensure that [GPE] remains the home of the first in nation [NORP] primary for [DATE] to come. And I think maybe more than anything else, I have proven that I keep my promises. I have proven it more than just about any president they say. But it is a true privilege to have this opportunity to speak with you. And my very first trip back to [GPE], this is about the beginning. This is it. We are starting, we are starting right here as a candidate for president. And you have probably seen the polls, we are really doing great. Remember I used to try In [DATE], I talked about polls all the time. In [DATE], I did not have to because we did not have a lot of competition. We had no competition. And I do not think we have a competition this time either, to be honest. But I talked about the polls and I will say that our polls, we are absolutely. We are so far ahead in the polls, both in [GPE]. [CARDINAL] came out [TIME], a very nice poll, we are way ahead and [CARDINAL] came out [DATE] on [ORG], and we are [CARDINAL] points up, [CARDINAL] points up. That is a lot. We will not play prevent, defense like they do in football though however. You know about prevent, defense? The team holds them and there is no way. They hold them for [CARDINAL] quarters and then they have to just stop them [CARDINAL] more time and they go to prevent. And they always lose, do not they? We do not do prevent defense. We just keep defending and we are going to win and we are going to win very big. But our polls have been fantastic. Everyone in this room shares the [CARDINAL] key mission. We are going to defeat [PERSON], defeat [PERSON] and the radical [NORP]. These are radical left people. I think in many cases they are [NORP] and communists and I used to say that seldom. Now, I say it all the time because they are. You look at what they are doing to our country, and we are going to turn [GPE] red on [DATE]. I hope we can have the help with everybody. Under [PERSON], our nation is being destroyed by a selfish, radical, and corrupt political establishment. That is what it is. Nobody even knows. Why are they doing? Why are they doing these things? Guys like [PERSON], [ORG] plus [CARDINAL]. The [CARDINAL] love it when I say that. They love that. They love hearing [ORG] plus [CARDINAL], all on [CARDINAL] of the [CARDINAL]. But they are bad. Crazy [PERSON] and crying [PERSON], and the group, they are running our country right into the ground. They are destroying our country. To save [GPE], we need a leader who is prepared to take on the forces laying waste to our country. And we need a president who is ready to hit the ground running on [DATE] and aye, here, boy, am I hitting the ground? The fake news, we have a lot of news [DATE]. Some of it is fake, but some are actually are very good. Some are very impressive. But they said when I announced I just want to put my cards in the table, we are playing that very big game right now, the biggest game of all because it involves the country and the survival of [GPE]. But when I put the cards on and then I said, All right, let us go. They said, He is not campaigning. This is [DATE] when I announced. Well, I said, I got [DATE]. They said, He is not doing rallies, he is not campaigning. Maybe he is lost that step. I am more angry now and I am more committed now than I ever was because Now, I read a story. I read a story where they talked about why is not he out there? It was like on a [DATE] night, and then I actually did something [TIME]. Little low-key stuff and lots of There is lots of work. We have great people with us, amazing people that I have met and really gotten to know because as a non-politician, I did not know anybody. I went to [GPE]. I tell the story. I am driving down [FAC] with our great first lady and I am looking over and I am saying, I saw the hotel that I built. It was very, very successful in [GPE]. And we had more police and more I never saw anything like it. We are going down [FAC], crowds are cheering and just going absolutely crazy. Motorcycles all over the place, [CARDINAL] of motorcycles and so beautiful, beautiful weather, beautiful everything. I looked at our first lady, I said, Do you believe it? I am the president of [GPE]. And I was never a big [GPE] person. It was not my world. I was a [GPE] person. So I did not know the people in [GPE] like a politician would who spent [DATE] and then ran for president. So I had to learn and I had to learn quick. And I have learned over [DATE]. I know the great ones and I know the not good ones. I know the rhinos that are not going to get it done, and I know people that are going to really get it done. I had to rely on, in many cases, some rhinos that we did not even know they were rhinos or not. But they are more dangerous in many ways than the [NORP], I tell you. They are actually. They are more dangerous. And we have incredible people. When you think of what we have done, we had the largest tax cut in the history of our country. We had the largest regulation cuts in the history of our country. We had the safest southern border in the history of our country. We had the least amount of drugs in [DATE] and [DATE]. Right now, it is [CARDINAL] times the drugs are pouring into our southern border as when I left. Think of that, [CARDINAL] times, not [PERCENT] more. Think of that, [CARDINAL] times more. It is coming in like water and cheaper than candy. Fentanyl, you buy cheaper than candy. You can go buy a candy bar, of course, you are much more than fentanyl and they can kill the entire nation with it. And frankly, that is probably what they are trying to do. So we had it done and we had a great thing going, and we had built [QUANTITY] of wall. All of the things that we did to make it so good. Stay in [GPE], nobody even heard of it. Stay in [GPE]. [GPE] said to us, Well, we are not going to do it. I said, Yes, you are, you are. They said. I said, No, no, no, you are going to do it, [PERCENT]. Then a representative came down and I dealt with somebody, a very nice woman for [ORG]. She worked with [GPE], on [GPE] for [DATE]. Very nice. She said, Sir, you cannot get these things. Stay in [GPE]. They will never agree to that. They will never agree to any of this stuff. I also said, I want [CARDINAL] 000 soldiers from [GPE] guarding our borders. Will you pay for it? No, we are not paying anything. And so she smiled and not as a bad person, she smiled. She thought it was a immature ask. I said, No, we will get it, [CARDINAL]. I mean, I will tell you it is not even a chance that we want. I said, Sir, okay. Then the representative from [GPE] came into the room. I will never forget. Nice guy too, quality guy. And I really like, even though he is a socialist, I really like the president of [GPE]. We have a very good friend. In fact, it took him a long time to call up President [PERSON]. It took him a long time. He could not . There were many leaders of countries that just could not do it. They did not believe it actually, even though we were very tough on many countries, we were tougher in [GPE] than anybody would've been. As you know, that would've never happened. The horror show that is going on right now would've never happened. But many, many countries felt that way. They just did not believe the result. But I said, Here is what we need, we need [CARDINAL] 000 soldiers and we want everybody staying in [GPE], never coming into [GPE] until we have them approved. So he said, no. And I said, Here is what is happening. If you do not approve it, then we are going to put a tariff on all of the cars that you stole from our country to make in [GPE] of [PERCENT]. And every product that is made in [GPE] is going to have a tariff of [PERCENT] on it, which would amount to [MONEY] for [GPE]. So the same gentleman, and he was, he is a nice guy. He said, I cannot believe you'd do that. I said, No, [PERCENT]. Here is the document right now. I will sign it. It is [DATE]. And in effect, this goes on on [DATE] at [TIME]. And I had the document right here, showed him the document. He was a little surprised. He said, May I take [TIME] to make a call? I wonder who he called, called the president and came back. Sir, we'd be honored to give you [CARDINAL] soldiers and we would be honored to keep everybody in [GPE], even the [ORG] gang members and everything until such time as they have to. And we had it going so good. And then think of it, they did not want. They come in, they said, come into [GPE]. They stopped the wall construction. We had built [QUANTITY] of wall, but they stopped the construction. [DATE], it could have been the addition because we added a lot more than we originally said we were going to do. We had to wait [DATE] because the [NORP] sued us. We had [CARDINAL] different lawsuits. We won all of the lawsuits. I actually got a lot of the money. I took it out of the military because I consider it to be defense of our country. It is an onslaught what is coming in, and we did all of those things and then they come in and what they have done to this country is incredible. Even staying out for medical reasons, you know all about that. Stay out for medical reasons. I mean, people are very ill and they are coming into our country. Now, they are emptying out as you know, their prisons Prisons, and they are emptying out their mental institutions. They are very smart people. I dealt with the leaders of those countries. I know them all, and they are very streetwise. They are very smart. They live, and they do well, but why should they pay for mental institutions when we can dump everybody into [GPE]? Why should they pay for prisons? It is massively expensive. It is a big portion of their budget. Why should they take care of MS-13 gang members, the worst anywhere in the world? Why should they do that when the stupid people running [GPE] will do it for them? What they are doing is poisoning our country. We cannot let it happen anymore. [DATE] I think of [GPE] in a way This never happened. Literally, I thought of this [DATE], and I said, I am coming up to a place that gets it, and maybe I should say it, and I went to my buddy and I went to a couple of people that have been with me a long time. It is sort of strange, but I think of [GPE], [DATE] as [DATE], and they said, Sir, what do you mean by that? I do not like the sound of that. I said, Well, listen to this, and I just gave a couple of ideas. We have open borders when they should be closed. It is [DATE]. We have prisoners, people from, as we just said, mental institutions and terrorists being dumped into our country when they should not be accepted. [DATE], right? Who would do that? Who would do this? Who would allow prisoners in? He goes [PERSON], and he said [PERSON]. You are both right. We have no voter ID when everyone wants voter ID. Even at the Democrat National Convention, they had a card on the front of them that was bigger than their chest, with the exception of some people. They had a card. It had everything, pictures, everything. But not for the [GPE] votes, right? So think of it, no voter ID when everyone wants it, even the [NORP]. They did a poll, [PERCENT] of [NORP] want voter ID. They do not want it because they want to cheat. That is what they are best at. We have a woke military that cannot fight or win, as proven in [GPE], but we lost unfortunately [MONEY] of it to [GPE] where we stupidly gave [MONEY] to these people. We had them in check. We had them totally in check. [PERSON], the head of the [ORG]. Why are you speaking to him, sir? Who else do I want to speak to? Who else am I supposed to speak to? We want to end it. I told [PERSON]. I said, [PERSON], you are killing a lot of our people. They did a lot during the [PERSON] administration. The snipers, they were killing our soldiers left and right, a lot of them, and the roadside bombs. You all know because it is a very military state, very state-focused on the military. I said, [PERSON], you are killing a lot of people. Here is the story. If you do this anymore, we are going to hit you harder than anybody has ever been hit by this country, and that is pretty hard. We are going to hit you so hard, left and right, up and down, you are going to regret it. You have to stop. There is no more, no more. This is over a telephone conversation, can you believe it? And, Yes, [PERSON] I do understand. He called me [PERSON] I wonder if he calls [PERSON] He is still there by the way, [PERSON]. He cannot believe his luck. Did he get lucky? Did he get lucky? We were getting out because it was time, [DATE], right? We were getting out, but we were going to get out with pride. We were going to get out. We were going to take our military out last, not first. We took our military out, and once we took the military out, they had I could just see [PERSON], tough, smart guy, sitting there, Sir, they just took the military out, and he looks at the guy and probably said, This guy is the stupidest guy. That cannot happen. They did. They took the military out first, and we left. Right now we have many, many hundreds, maybe [CARDINAL], but [CARDINAL] of [NORP] citizens there, they are stuck. But we did not take the equipment out, and we could have taken it out easy. I had [CARDINAL] of our generals that is currently there say to me, Sir, I think it is cheaper to leave the equipment than to take it. [MONEY], and I said, What do you mean cheaper? We have brand-new airplanes over there. You mean it is cheaper to leave a [MONEY] aircraft, latest and the greatest, the helicopters, brand-new Apache helicopters, hardly used, it is cheaper to leave it than to fly? Yes, sir. That is when I knew that this guy was not too good. I said, Listen, so you think it is better than we could give it [QUANTITY] of gas, fly it to [GPE], and then take it over here, right? Let it fly its way over, [QUANTITY] extra, a little bit of extra fuel, jet fuel, which [DATE] you cannot get by the way. Actually [DATE] he might be right. You cannot get it because of us. But think of it. I said, You think it is better just to leave it? Yes, sir. I think so. So we left them [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] rifles of the best. We left them [CARDINAL] 000 vehicles, many of them armored, cost [MONEY], armored plate. [QUANTITY] of steel on the bottom, you can imagine what they cost. [CARDINAL]. I do not know if anyone's in the car business, but I have a friend who is very big in the business. I said, Did you ever have a car lot with [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] cars? He said, [CARDINAL]? If we have [CARDINAL], we'd consider that oversupplied. I said, [CARDINAL], 000, think of it. And binoculars. They never fight They are very good fighters, the [ORG], but they never fight at [TIME] because they do not have binoculars. We have given them brand-new [CARDINAL] of binoculars, better than what we have, far better than what we have because they are brand new, they are the best. They are now one of the biggest sellers of arms to other countries because they have so much, they cannot possibly use that much. [CARDINAL], 000 rifles and guns they call it. [CARDINAL], 000, mostly brand-new stuff. We just dumped it over there and many other things, so this is what happened. So that is [DATE] Fool. We have a military that has to get back on track, and they do not want to. We have proposed mandatory electric stoves and electric cars, when everyone wants at least the option of choice because gas stoves cook better and gasoline cars go a lot longer. I have a friend who got an electric car. After [TIME], he is like, Where the hell do I get this thing Where do I get electric, please? He used to drive for [TIME]. Now he drives for a very short period of time, but he is happy because he thinks he is helping the environment. I said, You are not helping the environment. If you knew where the batteries were made, all made out of [GPE], and they are all made with minerals and substances found in [GPE]. The substance we have, more than anybody else, is something that gets refined into gasoline, and we have more, and they do not want to use it. This is a plot. We have people in the midst of the greatest crime wave in history that want to defund our police. That is [DATE]', is not it? Right, let us defund the police. You cannot even get in your car. You go to [GPE], nobody ever gets prosecuted. I am the only one they go after. No, it is true. Nobody gets prosecuted. They go after me. I have a man, he is [DATE], he got prosecuted because he did not pay tax on a company apartment. Who does? I mean, do people pay? He did not pay a tax on a company car. [DATE], he has a company car, did not pay tax. I guess did not pay tax on the education of his grandchildren. I paid for the education of his grandchildren. I have a lot of money. I paid for the education. They want to put him in jail. They put him in jail. Can you believe this? These crimes, fringe benefits it is called. These crimes have never been prosecuted before. To the best of our knowledge, we have never seen anything like it, only if it is somehow [PERSON]-related. Think of it, did not pay tax on the use of a company car. Most people would not even know where to begin. What is it? Well, how much is the car? Think of it, never been charged before that we know of, and they charged him criminally and they put him in jail, and it is a disgrace to our country. He is a fine man, never had a problem, I do not think he ever had a parking ticket. It is never happened before. How sad is it? That is what is happening to our country. We are going [NORP]. We have skipped socialism, that train has already left. We have men being encouraged to compete against women in sports, okay? Now think of it. The story I tell about the swimmer, where this great champion swimmer wants to win this race. She is worked so hard all her life. She is looking up and down, and she is seen the same girls and women that she is fought and swam against. Then she looks to the right, same thing, but there is this giant standing right next to her, and he hurt her very badly because he went by her so fast that she suffered massive windburn during the race, the whole thing. I think he beat her by, what is it, [TIME], right? She wanted to win. If she could win by [TIME], she is going to win. She is worked all her life for this, all her life. She is going to win by [TIME]. She is going to set the [GPE] record. She is a great athlete. He beat the record by [TIME]. That is not right. That is not right. We have [ORG] and [ORG] who hate our country and burn down our cities, and they are protected by law enforcement, while we put great [NORP] patriots in jail and destroy their lives, right? It is an unbelievable situation. We are begging foreign nations for oil when we have far more oil than they have. I call it liquid gold that is under our feet. We decided to stop drilling oil as it hits an all-time high. It hits the all-time high, highest ever, we are going to stop drilling. Think of it. It is supposed to be the opposite. See, this is again, it is [DATE]. Who would do that? Some friends of mine are great business people here. You got a lot of good business people up here, but they hear that when the price goes high, that is when they start. No, the price hits an all-time high, and that was [DATE] where he said, No drill. We are not going to drill. We are going wind. Let us kill all the birds. Let us destroy our plains and our beautiful oceans and seas and everything else. And then on top of it, we sell [GPE] [QUANTITY] of cheap oil. We are selling it to [GPE]. We demand windmills be built on our oceans. We demand they go on our prairies and our mountains and our plains, only to realize that they are killing all our birds at a level that If you go out hunting and you happen to shoot a bald eagle, they put you in jail for [DATE], right? They kill [CARDINAL] of them with these windmills, nothing happens. It is the most expensive and least reliable form of energy on our planet, extremely expensive, and the wind turbines are all made in [GPE]. Some are made in [GPE], but most are made in [GPE]. We have a president whose son's laptop from hell gets taken over and exposes massive corruption like nobody's ever seen before. You think the father Did you ever hear this? Do you think the father was upset? Dad, I left my laptop in a repair shop. I forgot to pick it up, and this repair guy went a little crazy when he saw what was on it. What is on it, son? Every crime that you have ever committed, pa. At what point does the father get angry, like, This kid is not working out well for me. Then the [ORG] goes and convinces the media that it is [NORP] disinformation. Remember, they went over to see the people at [ORG] and other media and other agencies also, but the [ORG], can you imagine the good old [ORG]? It is hard to believe what is happened there. This is [NORP] disinformation, so if you hear anything about it, do not put it in. Do not do it. Do not do it. You better not do it because it is [NORP] disinformation. It is not true. Even though they know that is a lie that they are telling them. Instead of doing that, they come after [PERSON]. Let us go after [PERSON]. Let us raid [FAC]. Nice secure place too. We have an [ORG] and [ORG] that does raid [FAC] in [GPE]. It is placed under lock and key. A very, very powerful building, very secure, very thick walls. It was built actually as a southern [ORG] by [PERSON] and [PERSON]. They willed it over to the government. [PERSON] turned it back. He said it was too expensive. Can you believe it? And I say, Thank you, [PERSON]. I appreciate it. But they asked if we could do them a favor. They saw the room. We are having very good discussions with [ORG], which is what we are supposed to do. We looked at the room. They asked us, Would you do us a favor? They came down and looked at it. I told them, Absolutely, go down and look. They looked at the room. They found everything in order. It was sealed. There was not stuff lying all over the garage floor. What a pigsty that place was, right? Classified documents. They looked at the room, and they made a request, Could you put on an additional lock? We had a strong lock. Could you put on an additional? I said, Absolutely. Let them put it on. Tell them. We put on additional. Then they came in and they raided [FAC] after that. We were having very good discussions with [ORG], but of course, [ORG] is very radical left. They have a red flag. I do not know. Does anybody know this? It is a red flag meaning danger. The Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights, can you imagine? This is what we are dealing with. They have it red flagged. So they raided, but if you take a look at it, and if you look at all these things, all of these things, I was going to go longer, but we want to get to who the hell your next boss is going to be, okay? I was going to go a lot longer, but honestly, I said, I am not sure the cameras have that much time. Look at all that press. Look at all that media. That is because this man, this great man's leaving, that is why. That is because [PERSON] is leaving, and he is coming with us. Thank goodness. If he was not coming with us, I might just have to forget about [GPE] and just mark it down to a loss, but with [PERSON], I do not think we can lose. I do not think we can lose. I think with [PERSON], we are going to mark it down to a victory. In [DATE], I have begun to introduce our bold, ambitious agenda to control and confront the colossal disasters that [PERSON] is leaving in his wake, what he is done to this country, the damage. I say all the time in the rallies, which are starting very soon, even though it is still very early. I almost enforced that we entered the rallies. Why is not he doing rallies [DATE]? But we are going to do them soon. I think we should do a big one up here, [PERSON], okay? Let us do a big one. They love our rallies. Bigger than they have ever been too, and the reason It is bigger. It is hotter. There is more enthusiasm now. I am in [GPE], and I am driving over to a big meeting, a destination. We go differentways sometimes, and they are driving over, and we have We are passing signs, and every lawn has [PERSON] [DATE], [PERSON]. The spirit, and the spirit is because they knew what they had, and now they look at what is happening to our country. So the spirit is even greater. Within [TIME] of my inauguration, we will restore every border security measure of the [PERSON] presidency, we had it so good, to quickly achieve the most secure border in [GPE] history again just as we had [DATE], and I will ask [ORG] to establish criminal penalties for any future administration that releases [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] of people that you do not want in our country. I do not say that as a bad person. I mean, I have a bigger heart than anybody, but we do not want their prisoners, and we do not want people that are living in mental institutions. We do not want terrorists in our country. We do not want it. We are going to be paying a price for a long time. We have to get them out. We have to get them out. They poison our country, the people who launched this invasion because it really is an invasion. We believe those people belong in jail. Something has to happen. When they say conservative, or liberal, or [NORP], or [NORP], or independent, it is really with people of common sense. It is not even conservative. It is people. It is just common sense. You want to have borders. You want to have voter ID. You want to have these things, and it is just Look, there is [CARDINAL] reasons this could be happening, the list that I read, and there is so many more, but the list that I read. There is [CARDINAL] reasons. They are stupid, which they are not because they are great at cheating at elections. They are not stupid. They are vicious. No. Anybody that cheats like that cannot be stupid, but they are either stupid or they hate our country, and it has to be they hate our country because who would allow this invasion of our country to take place? Despite [DATE] of working and all of the things we did, I mean, to get this stuff in place, and then they just walk away from it. We worked [DATE] to get it. We had to negotiate with [GPE] and stay in [GPE]. That was another deal. I think I pulled another tariff one on that one too, We are going to charge you so much, but they were great, and they understand it, too. They really understand it, and I came up with the name Caravan because we had caravans of [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], 000 people pouring in, not when I I will tell you what. We had it stopped pretty early, but now, if you look at these caravans, these are massive, massive caravans, and they have no idea who these people are coming into our country. They are walking in unabated. Nobody is asking them about health, but it is hard to get in. I have so many people, Can you help me become a citizen? I say, Yeah. Go to the southern border. Just walk across the line. I have a guy, rich guy, wants to become a citizen, and he is gone through everything. He is gone to school to study, and this, and this, and that. He is been working for [DATE]. He has not been able to pull it off. Okay? I finally said to him, You know, you have been working so hard. Why do not you just go down to [GPE], then suddenly start walking across our border? They will take you gladly. They will not even talk to you. Now, how ridiculous is it when you think people study, then they work, and they are on lists for [DATE], and [DATE], and [DATE] trying to come into our country legally, which we want all of those people we can get. Everybody agrees to that, right? But you have other people that are prisoners and that are very ill in many different ways, including mentally, and they just walk into our country. It is just crazy. Once they are in, they never get out. Although we took out [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] of [ORG] gang members. They were really killing places of They were killing [GPE] and other places. Under [PERSON], fentanyl, heroin, meth, and other lethal drugs. These are lethal drugs. Absolutely. Lethal drugs are pouring across our wide open border at levels never seen before and [CARDINAL] times greater than [DATE]. Think of it, [CARDINAL] times, devastating communities all across our state. The drug cartels are waging war in [GPE], and it is time that [GPE] wage war on the cartels. We should. I got very badly criticized by some of the rhinos mostly that said, Oh, behind the scenes, he was saying that maybe he is going to hit Patriot missiles into these drug dens, and they announced that. [CARDINAL] of the stupid people like a [PERSON] or somebody, these are stupid people, but they said, He is going to go into those area, and he is going to hit him with a Patriot missile. I said, Well, that is going to be [DATE] of bad publicity, except everybody said, What a great idea that is. It is like my poll numbers went up. It is crazy. This is a crazy world we are living in, and we have to be very careful because we have a very fragile country. This is a very fragile place. Just as we destroyed [ORG] You know I destroyed [ORG] in [DATE]. You know that, General [PERSON]. I said, What is your name? Sir, my name is [PERSON]. [PERSON] When I went over to [GPE] because I said, Why are not we beating [ORG], [PERSON]? He was central casting you. Most of you heard the story, but he did a great job. I was told in [GPE] by the [GPE] generals. I call them the television generals. They are not our real generals. We have great generals. We have a great army, great military. I created [ORG], which is a big deal. Turned out to be very important. General [PERSON]. I said, What is your name? Sir, my name is [PERSON]. Sir, [PERSON]. I said, I am going to like you. Are you kidding me? Your name is [PERSON]. This is a Then, I said, I was told it takes [DATE] to get rid of [ORG] and maybe we could not even do it in that by [GPE]. That is why I am over. I actually flew to [GPE] to meet with the generals. Sir, we can do it in [DATE], sir. I said, No, no, no. Say it [CARDINAL] more time. We can do it in [DATE]. Well, why have not they done it? Sir, they did not do it because I should not say this, sir. In fact, I will not say it because you know a military person is not supposed to say. I said, Why did not you convince them to do it the way you want to do it? It is not my place to do, sir. I am in the military, and I have to take orders. They came in from [GPE] and told us what to do. Even if I disagree with them, I have to take orders. I mean, I understand that. I am not sure I fully understand it because it does not seem to make a lot of sense, but militarily, I guess it does. I said, So, General, what would you different? I met him at the base of Air Force One with another general and a drill sergeant. These guys are all better looking than [PERSON]. You got to see these guys. They are like perfect human beings. The pilots on Air Force One were landing in the desert. We are landing, and I am saying They told me, Sir, turn off your lights, please. Why? [TIME] before landing, they said, Please turn off your lights, sir. Why? Why would I turn off my Because we are landing. I said, Well, you mean we spent [MONEY] in the Middle East that we cannot land? After spending [MONEY] and by the way, [CARDINAL] of people killed if you include the other side, which I include, but we spent [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL]. They said, Turn off your lights. Then, they come, and they not only turn off the lights, they put down the shades. It was so dark. So we are [TIME] out, and I went up to the front of the cockpit because I love going with these guys, seeing how great they are. The best pilots. Best pilots fly Air Force One. The best. They take the best pilots. These guys are something. Anybody fly Air Force One in this room? No? I heard some guy over there, but the best pilots. So we are out there, and we are getting ready to land. I said, Captain, I am getting a little nervous. I do not see any lights. Where is your runway? Sir, it is right ahead. I said, I have pretty good vision, Captain. I do not see anything ahead. It is there, sir. Then, you hear the mechanical They call it a mechanical voice. It is a computer. Beautiful voice, actually. [CARDINAL][CARDINAL]. [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] means you are at [QUANTITY]. That is very low. That is like a [CARDINAL]-story building. [CARDINAL], 000. 900. 800. 700. I said, Captain. I am sitting back. I am trying to be Captain, I do not see a runway up there. No, we are fine, sir. This guy, you ought to see. Crew cut, handsome as hell. I could take him to [GPE] [DATE]. If I was an agent, I'd make him a movie star. All of these guys. Central casting. Everything is perfect. Perfect. I do not think they ever had a problem in their life. So this perfect-looking guy with a perfect-looking co-pilot and perfect-looking people all over the place. I never saw so many people operate a plane, but these are minor details. That is why it is called Air Force One in [GPE], right? We have [CARDINAL] telephone operators. I might make [CARDINAL] call, right? I will call our First Lady. How you feeling? Everything good. Boom. They wait for me to make calls. So we are landing. We are getting [CARDINAL]. I said, So, Captain? He answers, Sir, it is fine. [CARDINAL]. [CARDINAL]. [CARDINAL]. Then, he goes, [CARDINAL]. So now we are [QUANTITY] over, which is nothing. Captain, we are okay, right? Yes. Yes, sir. Then, all of a sudden, [CARDINAL]. [CARDINAL]. I just closed my eyes. Bing, bing, boom, land. Perfect. No lights. Nothing. I said, Good. In fact, I checked immediately. I wanted to see whether or not I could award myself as president the Congressional Medal of Honor. Right? I wanted to see, but I do not know, [PERSON]. I do not think it would've played. I do not think the fake news media back there would like it. They would not be happy with that. Can you imagine if I awarded? They said, This is not good, but I do not think I had the right. Anyway, I got off the plane. I see General [PERSON]. He said, No, sir. No. We can take it [DATE]. We can do it in [DATE]. He said, Sir, would you like to rest? I will never forget. I am walking off, and these beautiful-looking soldiers. They are generals, and colonels, and everybody. It is like central casting. You could make a movie. If I took a camera, I would've made a movie out of it, but I walk. He says, Sir, would you like to rest up? I said, No, I do not want to rest up. Let us go right to work. Now, do you think [PERSON] would say that? I do not think He'd rest for [DATE]. He'd rest for [DATE], and then they'd walk him back to the plane. They would not have a discussion. No, I said, Let us go to your room. So we went up to this gorgeous room. This is a fortress. This is an incredible fortress with [QUANTITY] walls of concrete. I mean, this is really an amazing thing, and we go into this area that is very secure with no lights at all, practically. Then, we turned the lights on. There are no windows. I mean, just purely It is a bunker. Really, it is highly sophisticated stuff. I said, So why can you do it in such a short period of time when they told me in [GPE] they probably could not do it in [DATE]? Well, sir, we'd do it differently. How would you do it differently? Well, they only attack from this location, and we are very far away. By the time the planes got there, we had it pretty much turned back. We did not have any time, but sir, I'd attack them from the front. I'd leave from here. We have many other bases, temporary bases in many cases, but they have runways. That is all we need, sir. There is a runway. We do not have to have fancy, and I had attack them, sir, from [CARDINAL] different locations. We are fully equipped. I'd hit them from the front, and I'd hit them from the back. I'd hit them from up top, and I'd hit them from below, sir, and they would not know what the hell hit them. You know what, sir? I think we will do it in [DATE]. I said, Why did not you tell this to these people? It is not my place. Okay? I said, General, let me give this a little thought. I go back to [GPE]. I said, You sure you can do this? Yes, sir. I can do this. We can do this properly, the way it should be done. I am telling this story. I was not going to. I am telling this story because we have an incredible military, and you have to understand that. When you see these blundering idiots that leave [MONEY] worth of equipment behind, the best equipment in the world that I bought. I bought the best Apache helicopters. I bought it. I rebuilt our entire military. We had great people. We had people that got in through the rhinos and got in some bad I mean, for the most part, we rebuilt the entire military. I tell you this because you see these blundering fools on television that say I should not be standing in front of a church with a Bible. Remember? That was a terrible thing to do. I am standing with a Bible in front of a church that these terrorists tried to burn down [DATE], and they are saying, Oh, they wish they did not walk because I tell you what. These are fools, but I am telling you because we have an amazing military. So after a short period of time, they hit them hard, and [PERCENT] of [ORG] was gone. That was it. [PERCENT], it was gone. [PERCENT]. So we have a great military, but we have some fools right now on top. As I announced [DATE], we will eliminate federal funding for any school that pushes critical race theory or left wing gender ideology. I will get for you parents' rights, including the direct election of principals by the parents. Would not that be a good idea? How simple is that? Common sense. The ultimate form of local control. You want to have the parents pick the principal and superintendents. We will keep men out of women's sports. We are not doing this anymore with the men out of women's sports. We are going to end that policy. That policy is prevalent. It is incredible what is going on. The amazing thing is that the women are afraid to speak up. So many of them. Every once in a while, you will see one, and they are getting congratulated for having the courage. I do not know what takes courage, but it does. It takes courage because they get absolutely just decimated by just speaking up about something so basic as that. We will end [PERSON] war on [NORP] energy and restore [NORP] energy independence as we had it [DATE]. We were energy independent [DATE] for the first time ever, and we were soon going to be energy dominant, and we were going to make so much money with energy that we were going to reduce your taxes even further. I gave you the biggest tax cut in history, bigger than [PERSON]'s, and we were going to reduce it further. We would've paid off the debt of our country. We were going to be supplying Europe with energy, supplying everybody with energy, and they ended it. It is not even believable. I will quickly rebuild the greatest economy in the history of our world, and the proven formula is really low taxes. I reduced the taxes, and we took in more revenue after I reduced the taxes. So, you need the revenue. We took in more revenue. I also made it possible for companies to bring in [MONEY] that they had overseas. They could not bring it in because bureaucratically, it was too tough, and the tax was too high. They had to pay [PERCENT] tax. Who is going to bring the money? So they let it stay in Europe, and they let it stay in Asia, and they do things there. So we took in [CARDINAL], and [MONEY] came back in, and they used that money to build in our country. We will end the [NORP] imports of essential goods and replace them with products made in [GPE] and made in [GPE], by the way. And I will force [GPE] to sell any current holdings in [GPE] that puts our national security at risk. They are buying land right next to our very important military areas. I took in [MONEY] in taxes and tariffs from [GPE]. Think of that. [MONEY]. I gave [CARDINAL] to the farmers because they were treated so badly and it was just peanuts compared to what I took in. The farmers love me. You go to [GPE]. Those farmers, they better love me. But you have some wiseguy coming and say how great he is to the farmers. No, I do not think they would buy it. Took in [MONEY] for the farmers. I gave them a checks. We split it around. Everybody got, because what [GPE] did to the farmers was incredible. And we brought many businesses back from [GPE] because of what I did with the taxes and tariffs. It gave an incentive for them to come back. And no other president has ever done anything like it. And no other president, I took in [MONEY]. Think of that. Billions, not [CARDINAL]. [MONEY]. Took in [MONEY] from [GPE]. Not [CARDINAL] other president took in [MONEY], not [MONEY]. They never had the courage to talk [MONEY]. And I got along great with President [PERSON], but he understood that we understood what the game was. And then when [PERSON] came, I did not get along because I said that was too much to bear. That was just too much. What they did with the [GPE] lab, it came out of the [GPE] lab. And I said that for a long time. Came right out of the [GPE] lab. We will crack down harder on violent crime, investigate radical left wing prosecutors. These are radical left wing prosecutors who just are absolutely horrible, horrible people. And if necessary, use federal assets in [NORP]-run cities to restore law and order. The [NORP] are supposed to do that. You have to get their permission in theory to go in. Next time, it is [CARDINAL] thing I would do different. I did it for a reason. I wanted to show how bad they would be. And they were just so bad. [GPE], they took over [GPE]. [GPE], look at that. How about they took over the police station and then ultimately I said, I do not care. We are sending in [ORG]. We sent it in. But you are supposed to wait for the governor or the mayors to ask for approval. And I would not wait very long. I will tell you that. I did it. I did it the right way. The [CARDINAL] thing that I have shown how bad they are, how bad they are and how dangerous they are because they would never call. They could have a city or state taken over and they would not call for military help. But we came into, as an example, [GPE]. Remember that? [DATE] it was going. And then you have [ORG] saying, Not much is happening, and the reporter behind them, the whole city's burning. God! Do you ever see that? We are here and there is been some minor skirmishes. Not bad. Behind him the entire city is in flames. So, I will support a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on members of [ORG]. It is time. It is time. And only a non-politician would do that. A lifetime ban on lobbying by former members of [ORG] because I see the things that are happening. And also cabinet members and a ban on members of [ORG] getting rich by trading stocks with insider information like [PERSON] and her husband. We will keep [GPE] out of foolish foreign wars just as I did as commander- in-chief. And I will restore pre It is called peace through strength. By the way, and everyone thought when I ran, they said, This guy's going to be in world Remember crooked [PERSON]? He is going to cause a war in [DATE] in office, because they think that is my personality type. It is actually the opposite. My personality kept us out of war. And I told you before, would've never happened with [GPE]. Would've never gone in [PERSON], would've never, ever gone in. And even now I could solve that in [TIME]. It is so horrible what happened. Those cities are demolished now, the people. I will bet you have [CARDINAL]. It could be [CARDINAL] of you. They bomb a city to the ground. These big buildings come tumbling down. They say, [CARDINAL] people were injured. Not [CARDINAL] people. They lie. I mean, they lie. But, if I were president, you would have [CARDINAL] chance that that war would've happened. And even now, as bad as it is, should have never, ever happened. I mean, the country, how does it ever rebuild those cities, those magnificent buildings that came down that are [DATE] with the gold domes? You cannot do that. But it would've just So, so sad to see that. A deal would've been made very quickly. I am not even sure a deal would've had to be made. I do not think he would've He would've never done it. And let us see what happens with [GPE] and [GPE] because they see how incompetent we are. So, let us see what they are going to do there. But we will root out the deep state and stop the weaponization of federal agencies because there is a weaponization like nobody's ever seen. We will use every tool at our disposal. We will give to [PERSON] to defend election integrity and we will dismantle the illegal censorship regime and bring back free speech to [GPE]. And as they say in [GPE], live free or die. That is pretty good, right? Live free. So That is good. Proud of That is great. That is great. Live free or die. This is just the beginning of our agenda. I look forward to returning. Many times I will be here. Many times I will be with you. I like it here, first of all. I guess if I did not , maybe I would not be back so much. But I love the people here. They are great spirit. They are incredible people. [DATE], we will win the [GPE] primary. And then, with the help of the good people of this state, I love the people, we are going to take back our country and we will take back [ORG] and we are going to straighten out [GPE], okay? And God bless you all. Now, I am going to be reintroducing Chairman [PERSON], who is going to do a very important thing. He is going to make an announcement. And the announcement is who is going to be the next [GPE] [ORG] chair. So, whoever that is going to be, I am going to immediately start treating him very nicely because he will have a big impact on the election. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. [PERSON], you take over. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}

Read the full speech transcript here. Well, thank you very much. Governor [PERSON], Secretary [PERSON], we very much appreciate it. Members of [ORG], distinguished guests, and a very special hello to [GPE]. As we begin [DATE], the First Lady and I would wish each and every one of you a very, very happy Independence Day. Thank you. Let us show our appreciation to [ORG] and [ORG] and [ORG] for inspiring us with that magnificent display of [NORP] air power, and of course our gratitude as always to the legendary and very talented Blue Angels. Thank you very much. Let us also send you our deepest thanks to our wonderful veterans, law enforcement, first responders, and the doctors, nurses, and scientists working tirelessly to kill the virus. They are working hard. I want to thank them very, very much. We are grateful as well to your state's congressional delegation. Senator [PERSON]. [PERSON], thank you very much. Senator [PERSON]. Thank you, [PERSON]. And [PERSON], Congressman. Hi, [PERSON]. Thank you. And all others with us [TIME] from [ORG], thank you very much for coming. We appreciate it. There could be no better place to celebrate [GPE]'s independence than beneath this magnificent, incredible majestic mountain and monument to the greatest [NORP] who have ever lived. [DATE] we pay tribute to the exceptional lives and extraordinary legacies of [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], and [PERSON]. I am here as your president to proclaim before the country and before the world, this monument will never be desecrated, these heroes will never be defamed, their legacy will never ever be destroyed, their achievements will never be forgotten, and [FAC] will stand forever as an eternal tribute to our forefathers and to our freedom. We gather [TIME] to herald [DATE] in the history of nations, [DATE]. At those words, every [NORP] heart should swell with pride, every [NORP] family should cheer with delight, and every [NORP] patriot should be filled with joy because each of you lives in the most magnificent country in the history of the world and it will soon be greater than ever before. Our founders launched not only a revolution in government, but a revolution in the pursuit of justice, equality, liberty, and prosperity. No nation has done more to advance the human condition than [GPE] and no people have done more to promote human progress than the citizens of our great nation. It was all made possible by the courage of [CARDINAL] patriots who gathered in [GPE] [DATE] and signed the Declaration of Independence. They enshrined a divine truth that changed the world forever when they said, All men are created equal. These immortal words set in motion the unstoppable march of freedom. Our founders boldly declared that we are all endowed with the same divine rights, given us by our Creator in Heaven, and that which God has given us, we will allow no one ever to take away ever. [DATE] represented the culmination of [DATE] of Western civilization and the triumph of not only spirit, but of wisdom, philosophy, and reason. And yet, as we meet here [TIME], there is a growing danger that threatens every blessing our ancestors fought so hard for, struggled, they bled to secure. Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate our children. Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our founders, deface our most sacred memorials, and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities. Many of these people have no idea why they are doing this, but some know what they are doing. They think the [NORP] people are weak and soft and submissive, but no, the [NORP] people are strong and proud and they will not allow our country and all of its values, history, and culture to be taken from them. [CARDINAL] of their political weapons is cancel culture, driving people from their jobs, shaming dissenters, and demanding total submission from anyone who disagrees. This is the very definition of totalitarianism, and it is completely alien to our culture and to our values and it has absolutely no place in [GPE]. This attack on our liberty, our magnificent liberty must be stopped and it will be stopped very quickly. We will expose this dangerous movement, protect our nation's children from this radical assault, and preserve our beloved [NORP] way of life. In our schools, our newsrooms, even our corporate boardrooms, there is a new far-left fascism that demands absolute allegiance. If you do not speak its language, perform its rituals, recite its mantras, and follow its commandments, then you will be censored, banished, blacklisted, persecuted, and punished. It is not going to happen to us. Make no mistake. This left-wing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the American Revolution. In so doing they would destroy the very civilization that rescued [CARDINAL] from poverty, disease, violence, and hunger, and that lifted humanity to new heights of achievement, discovery, and progress. To make this possible, they are determined to tear down every statue, symbol, and memory of our national heritage. True. That is very true actually. That is why I am deploying federal law enforcement to protect our monuments, arrest the rioters, and prosecutors offenders to the fullest extent of the law. I am pleased to report that [DATE], federal agents arrested the suspected ringleader of the attack on the statue of the great [PERSON] in [GPE], [GPE], and in addition, [CARDINAL] more have been arrested. Under the executive order I signed [DATE] pertaining to the Veterans Memorial Preservation Memorial and Recognition Act and other laws, people who damage or deface federal statues or monuments will get a minimum of [DATE] in prison and obviously that includes our beautiful Mount Rushmore. Our people have a great memory. They will never forget the destruction of statues and monuments to [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], abolitionists and many others. The violent mayhem we have seen in the streets and cities that are run by liberal [NORP] in every case is the predictable result of [DATE] of extreme indoctrination and bias in education, journalism, and other cultural institutions. Against every law of society and nature, our children are taught in school to hate their own country and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes but that were villains. The radical view of [NORP] history is a web of lies, all perspective is removed, every virtue is obscured, every motive is twisted, every fact is distorted and every flaw is magnified until the history is purged and the record is disfigured beyond all recognition. This movement is openly attacking the legacies of every person on Mount Rushmore. They defiled the memory of [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON] and [PERSON]. [DATE] we will set history and history's record straight. Before these figures were immortalized in stone, they were [NORP] giants in full flesh and blood, gallant men, whose intrepid deeds unleashed the greatest leap of human advancement the world has ever known. [TIME] I will tell you and most importantly the youth of our nation the true stories of these great, great men. From head to toe [PERSON] represented the strength, grace, and dignity of the [NORP] people. From a small volunteer force of citizen farmers, he created [ORG] out of nothing and rallied them to stand against the most powerful military on earth. Through [DATE], through the brutal [DATE] at [FAC], through setback after setback on the field of battle, he led those patriots to ultimate triumph. When the army had dwindled to [CARDINAL] men at [DATE], when defeat seemed absolutely certain, he took what remained of his forces on a daring [TIME] crossing of the Delaware River. They marched through [QUANTITY] of frigid darkness, many without boots on their feet, leaving a trail of blood in the snow. In [TIME], they seized victory at [GPE] after forcing the surrender of the most powerful empire on the planet at [GPE], General [PERSON] did not claim power but simply returned to [FAC] as a private citizen. When called upon again, he presided over the Constitutional Convention in [GPE] and was unanimously elected our first president. When he stepped down after [CARDINAL] terms, his former adversary, King [PERSON] called him the greatest man of the age. He remains first in our hearts to this day, for as long as [NORP] love this land, we will honor and cherish the father of our country, [PERSON]. He will never be removed, abolished, and most of all, he will never be forgotten. [PERSON], the great [PERSON], was [DATE] when he traveled north to [GPE] and brilliantly authored [CARDINAL] of the greatest treasures of human history, the Declaration of Independence. He also drafted [GPE]'s constitution and conceived and wrote the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, a model for our cherished First Amendment. After serving as the first Secretary of [ORG], and then Vice President, he was elected to the presidency. He ordered [NORP] warriors to crush [NORP] pirates. He doubled the size of our nation with the Louisiana Purchase and he sent the famous explorers [PERSON] and [PERSON] into the west on a daring expedition to the Pacific Ocean. He was an architect, an inventor, a diplomat, a scholar, the founder of [CARDINAL] of the world's great universities and an ardent defender of liberty. [NORP] will forever admire the author of [NORP] freedom, [PERSON], and he too will never, ever be abandoned by us. [PERSON], the savior of our union, was a self-taught country lawyer who grew up in a log cabin on the [NORP] frontier. The first [NORP] president, he rose to high office from obscurity based on a force and clarity of his anti-slavery convictions. Very, very strong convictions. He signed the law that built [FAC]. He signed the Homestead Act given to some incredible scholars as simply defined ordinary citizens free land to settle anywhere in the [NORP] West, and he led the country through [TIME] hours of [NORP] history, giving every ounce of strength that he had to ensure that government of the people, by the people and for the people did not perish from this earth. He served as commander in chief of [ORG] during our bloodiest war, the struggle that saved our union and extinguished the evil of slavery. [CARDINAL], 000 died in that war, [CARDINAL] were killed or wounded in [DATE] in [GPE]. At [GPE] [DATE], the [GPE] bravely withstood an assault of [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] men and threw back Pickett's Charge. [PERSON] won the Civil War. He issued the Emancipation Proclamation. He led the passage of the 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery for all-time and ultimately his determination to preserve our nation and our union cost him his life. For as long as we live, [NORP] will uphold and revere the immortal memory of President [PERSON]. [PERSON] exemplified the unbridled confidence of our national culture and identity. He saw the towering grandeur of [GPE]'s mission in the world and he pursued it withoverwhelming energy and zeal. As a Lieutenant Colonel during the Spanish-American War, he led the famous [ORG] to defeat the enemy at San Juan Hill. He cleaned up corruption as police commissioner of [GPE], then served as the Governor of [GPE], Vice President, and at [DATE], became the youngest ever President of [GPE]. He sent our great new naval fleet around the globe to announce [GPE]'s arrival as a world power. He gave us many of our national parks, including the Grand Canyon. He oversaw the construction of the awe-inspiring [FAC] and he is the only person ever awarded both the Nobel Peace Prize and the Congressional Medal of Honor. He was [NORP] freedom personified in full. The [NORP] people will never relinquish the bold, beautiful and untamed spirit of [PERSON]. No movement that seeks to dismantle these treasured [NORP] legacies can possibly have a love of [GPE] at its heart. Cannot happen. No person who remains quiet at the destruction of this resplendent heritage can possibly lead us to a better future. The radical ideology attacking our country advances under the banner of social justice, but in truth, it would demolish both justice and society. It would transform justice into an instrument of division and vengeance and it would turn our free and inclusive society into a place of a repression, domination, and exclusion. They want to silence us, but we will not be silenced. We will state the truth in full without apology. We declare that [GPE] is the most just and exceptional nation ever to exist on earth. We are proud of the fact that our country was founded on [NORP] principles and we understand that these values have dramatically advanced the cause of peace and justice throughout the world. We know that the [NORP] family is the bedrock of [NORP] life. We recognize the solemn right and moral duty of every nation to secure its borders and we are building the wall. We remember that governments exist to protect the safety and happiness of their own people. A nation must care for its own citizens first. We must take care of [GPE] first. It is time. We believe in equal opportunity, equal justice, and equal treatment for citizens of every race, background, religion and creed. Every child of every color, born and unborn, is made in the holy image of God. We want free and open debate, not speech codes and cancel culture. We embrace tolerance, not prejudice. We support the courageous men and women of law enforcement. We will never abolish our police or our great Second Amendment which gives us the right to keep and bear arms. We believe that our children should be taught to love their country, honor their history, and respect our great [NORP] flag. We stand tall, we stand proud, and we only kneel to Almighty God. This is who we are. This is what we believe and these are the values that will guide us as we strive to build an even better and greater future. Those who seek to erase our heritage want [NORP] to forget our pride and our great dignity so that we can no longer understand ourselves or [GPE]'s destiny. In toppling the heroes of [DATE], they seek to dissolve the bonds of love and loyalty that we feel for our country and that we feel for each other. Their goal is not a better [GPE], their goal is to end [GPE]. In its place, they want power for themselves, but just as patriots did in [DATE], the [NORP] people will stand in their way and we will win and win quickly and with great dignity. We will never let them rip [GPE]'s heroes from our monuments or from our hearts. By tearing down [PERSON] and [PERSON], these radicals would tear down the very heritage for which men gave their lives to win the Civil War, they would erase the memory that inspired those soldiers to go to their deaths, singing these words of the Battle Hymn of the Republic, As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free, while God is marching on. They would tear down the principles that propelled the abolition of slavery and ultimately around the world ending an evil institution that had plagued humanity for [DATE]. Our opponents would tear apart the very documents that [PERSON] used to express his dream and the ideas that were the foundation of the righteous movement for Civil Rights. They would tear down the beliefs, culture and identity, that have made [GPE] the most vibrant and tolerant society in the history of the earth. My fellow [NORP], it is time to speak up loudly and strongly and powerfully and defend the integrity of our country. It is time for our politicians to summon the bravery and determination of our [NORP] ancestors. It is time. It is time to plant our flag and to protect the greatest of this nation for citizens of every race in every city in every part of this glorious land. For the sake of our honor, for the sake of our children, for the sake of our union, we must protect and preserve our history, our heritage, and our great heroes. Here [TIME] before the eyes of our forefathers, [NORP] declare again, as we did [DATE], that we will not be tyrannized, we will not be demeaned, and we will not be intimidated by bad, evil people. It will not happen. We will proclaim the ideals of the Declaration of Independence and we will never surrender the spirit and the courage and the cause of [DATE]. Upon this ground, we will stand firm and unwavering. In the face of lies meant to divide us, demoralize us and diminish us, we will show that the story of [GPE] unites us and - We will show that the story of [GPE] unites us, inspires us, includes us all, and makes everyone free. We must demand that our children are taught once again to see [GPE] as did Reverend [PERSON] when he said that the founders had signed a promissory note to every future generation. Dr. [PERSON] saw that the mission of justice required us to fully embrace our founding ideals. Those ideals are so important to us, the founding ideals. He called on his fellow citizens not to rip down their heritage, but to live up to their heritage. Above all, our children from every community must be taught that to be [NORP] is to inherit the spirit of the most adventurous and confident people ever to walk the face of the Earth. [NORP] are the people who pursued our Manifest Destiny across the ocean, into the uncharted wilderness, over the tallest mountains, and then into the skies, and even into the stars. We are the country of [PERSON], [PERSON], and [PERSON]. We are the land of [PERSON] and [PERSON]. We are the nation that gave rise to the [PERSON] brothers, the [ORG] airmen, [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], General [PERSON], the great [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], and [PERSON], and only [GPE] could have produced them all. No other place. We are the culture that put up [FAC], laid down the highways, and sculpted the skyline of [GPE]. We are the people who dreamed the spectacular dream, it was called [GPE] in the [GPE] desert, who built up [GPE] from the [GPE] marsh, and who carved our heroes into the face of Mount Rushmore. [NORP] harnessed electricity, split the atom, and gave the world the telephone and the internet. We settled the Wild West, won [CARDINAL] World Wars, landed [NORP] astronauts on the moon. And [DATE] very soon, we will plant our flag on Mars. We gave the world the poetry of [PERSON], the stories of [PERSON], the songs of [PERSON], the voice of [PERSON], the style of [PERSON], the comedy of [PERSON], the power of the Saturn V rocket, the toughness of the [ORG] F150, and the awesome might of the [NORP] aircraft carriers. [NORP] must never lose sight of this miraculous story. We should never lose sight of it. Nobody has ever done it like we have done it. So [DATE], under the authority vested in me as President of [GPE], I am announcing the creation of a new monument to the giants of our past. I am signing an executive order to establish [ORG] American heroes, a vast outdoor park that will feature the statues of the greatest [NORP] to ever live. From [TIME], and from this magnificent place, let us go forward united in our purpose and rededicated in our resolve. We will raise the next generation of [NORP] patriots. We will write the next thrilling chapter of the [NORP] adventure. And we will teach our children to know that they live in a land of legends, that nothing can stop them, and that no one can hold them down. They will know that, in [GPE], you can do anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything. Uplifted by the titans of Mount Rushmore, we will find unity that no one expected. We will make strides that no one thought possible. This country will be everything that our citizens have hoped for for [DATE], and that our enemies fear, because we will never forget that the [NORP] freedom exists for [NORP] greatness. And that is what we have, [NORP] greatness. [DATE] from now, our legacy will be the cities we built, the champions we forged, the good that we did, and the monuments we created to inspire us all. My fellow citizens, [GPE]'s destiny is in our sights. [GPE]'s heroes are embedded in our hearts. [GPE]'s future is in our hands. And ladies and gentlemen, the best is yet to come. This has been a great honor for the First Lady and myself to be with you. I love your state. I love this country. I'd like to wish everybody a very happy [DATE] to all. God bless you. God bless your families. God bless our great military, and God bless [GPE]. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsdonaldtrumprallytranscriptjanesvillewioctober17", "text": "I thank you. This is great. Hello. How are you? Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you. Hello, [GPE], and hello, [GPE]. We love [GPE]. Look at this crowd. This is massive. But you know we are having massive crowds all over the place and I will tell you what, I look at a poll we are even in [GPE]. I do not think so. With what I have done for you, [ORG], we got rid of those horrible You know what you were being charged? [PERCENT] tariff to do business with [GPE]. I heard about that. I did not like that. Your specialty milk people got me. Do you believe it? It was all about specialty milk. That was like the straw that broke the camel's back. I said, What do you mean? Yes, sir, they are charging us [PERCENT]. I said, No, they are not any longer. And we knocked the hell out of it and we got the brand new [ORG]. [PERSON] cannot do that, it is not in his vocabulary. He has no idea what we just said. He is sitting in his basement right now watching us. He has no idea. I hate to do this to you. I was a great hair day, and then I heard you at [QUANTITY] winds. I said, All right, give me the cap. I do not do it often. But now I am looking at that beautiful sight. Is that beautiful? As beautiful as that is, [ORG], as beautiful as that is, I do not know that I'd want to be those people right in that little corner. Look at that. I think it is magnificent, but I'd get out of there. But they have no fear, do you? You have confidence in [SPEAKER]. Yeah, we get good equipment. Good equipment. It is great to be back in [GPE] with [CARDINAL] of loyal, hard-working [NORP]. We had a problem, big problem in [GPE]. We had a surge, they opened it up, it is all opened up. [GPE], they had a surge. It is all opened up. Our country is opening. I will tell you what, when you look at our numbers compared to what is going on in Europe and other places, but we are doing well. We are going to have [CARDINAL] of the best economic years we have ever had [DATE]. [CARDINAL] of the best we have ever had. [DATE], we are going to win the state of [GPE], and we are going to win [DATE] in the running. By the way, early voting begins on [DATE], so get out and vote. Okay? Now, we have had great success in your state and I have been very good to you, likewise, with the ships. You build good ships. You know that, right? A lot of other states wanted that contract. I probably lost some states because of it, but we gave you the big contract. Honestly, I went to the yards. It is incredible what you do. This is the most important election in the history of our country. [DATE] I was saying, Well, how do you compare with the last one? I do not know. That was important. The fact is, this is the single most important election in the history of our country. Sleepy [PERSON]'s made a corrupt bargain. You saw the bargain he made, in exchange for his party's nomination, which he should not have gotten because if [PERSON] got out [DATE] early, I'd be running against Crazy [PERSON], which would have been okay, too. I would have had a small but energized base. Now we have a little bit larger base to run against, but there is [CARDINAL] energy. They are reporting on it. We have got the most energy in the history of politics, and he is got the least. The most in the history. [PERSON] handed control of his party over to hardcore militant left. [ORG], you once knew no longer exists, it is now a party of socialists and [NORP] and left wing extremists. If [PERSON] and the [NORP] socialists are elected, and I have always said, Our country will never be a socialist country. They would kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments, and you have a lot of great law enforcement people here [DATE]. Thank you. I think we have every single law enforcement group in the country's endorsed us. Even [GPE] finest. You know they endorsed us, first time they have ever endorsed a presidential candidate. It is big stuff. [GPE], [GPE], [GPE]. Everybody's endorsed us. During the debate, I said, [PERSON], name [CARDINAL] group, law enforcement, that is endorsed you. Name [CARDINAL]. He was starting to go, Ahh. He could breathe. And then, [PERSON] bailed him out. I said, [PERSON], say the words law and order. Say them, [PERSON]. He would not do it. I said, Say the words loiter, then [PERSON] bailed him again. But he cannot , because if he says law and order, that means he loses the radical left, which I think he is losing anyway. But they want to dissolve your borders, raise your taxes, destroy your suburbs. Oh, have I saved your suburbs. The women, they keep telling me about suburban women. I think suburban women liked it. I have only saved your house, and frankly, I have saved your way of life. I have saved the [NORP] dream. But they keep saying, [SPEAKER] has a problem. Well, last time they said the same thing. It was even worse. They said I had a problem with women, period. And then [TIME], [TIME] [DATE]. Was that the greatest of all time? It is probably [TIME] night in the history of television, right? We had so much fun. The tears that were flowing out of pure Remember the tears? From the totally non-biased anchors. We have another one of them coming up [DATE], [PERSON]. She deleted her entire account. I wonder why. I cannot imagine. I have known her for a long time. She is extraordinarily unfair, but that is all right. We did very well [TIME] with a person I knew was even more unfair, [PERSON]. In fact, nobody's seen [PERSON] for [DATE]. What happened to [PERSON]? What happened to [PERSON]? They said, We'd like to give [PERSON] I said, That is all right. What difference does it make? They ask you a question, you give them an answer. Right? It does not matter. But she was sort of jumping out of her seat. She was like flying. She was like, I told you. I told you. I said, I do not care what you told me. What does that mean? No. We actually got [CARDINAL] plus marks on that. But it was very unfair. Then you watch [PERSON] get interviewed by [PERSON]. Nice guy, but he is a tough guy. He is tough. I interviewed with him [DATE]. He was tough. He is giving these lobs in slow motion, lobs. No, it is unfair, but you know what? It is so unfair and we are president and they are not, but that is our own [inaudible 00:08:55]. We are. We are. But they want to fund extreme, late-term abortion. They want to pack You got to get out and vote. You got to get out and vote. Got to get out and vote. They want to pack [ORG]. You know what that is? It could end up with [DATE]. They want to put far left judges on the court. They are going to pick people so far left, and you will end up with far left justices like we have never had ever before. [ORG], instead of being what it is now, revered, will end up being nothing. They want to protect criminals and disarm law-abiding [NORP]. They want to take away your second amendment. If [PERSON] wins the lawless demonstrators in our streets, and you see them all the time, they are democratic-run. You know I always say [NORP]. You know why? Because it sounds worse. They should actually change their name to the [NORP]. [NORP] sounds lousy. But you know what? That is actually their name, [ORG]. Right? [ORG]. So I always say [NORP]. They say [NORP]. I said, Why do not you try changing your name officially? But they are lawless demonstrators, and they are, they are all [NORP]-run cities and states, almost every single one of them, and they do not want to really take care of it. They do not want to take care of law enforcement. They want it cut. You see what is going on in [GPE]. First of all, the police who we love, they are all quitting, they are all leaving. They'd still be occupying [GPE], except they found out that we were going in [TIME] that they all raised their hands. The reason they raised their hands is we were going in [TIME], we were going to take over. Can you believe it? We are going to take over the section, the large section of [GPE] that these anarchists had. They are anarchists. That is all they are. Law and order is right. In theory, we have to be asked and [ORG] has to be asked. But we went into [GPE], and you know what happened? How long did that take? [TIME]? Remember, they formed a line, they formed another line, they were not socially distance, which is very bad. In fact, they were very close. They had the world's most expensive uniforms on. They had helmets that cost a fortune. There was more computer stuff going on in those helmets. But under the helmets, great brains, and tough. They formed those lines, and then they said, Okay, let us go. This is after [DATE] of destruction in [GPE]. That is why we are going to win [GPE] for the first time since [DATE], [ORG]. We are going to win. Now, it does not hurt that in [GPE] they have [PERSON], who hates our country, who is broken the law, she is broken the law. Let us see what happens, but she is broken the law. But she hates our country. Nah, we are going to win. We are going to win because of what we did with [GPE], we saved [GPE], and we saved [GPE]. [GPE] was going real bad. Do you want to know the truth? We are sort of saving the whole country if you really think about it. That is why we have spirit, the likes of which I do not think any campaign has ever had. That is what is happened. That is what is happened. You know something? I just left [GPE]. You know that. Look forward to coming over here. But I just left, and the early voting was going big. It should. It is supposed to go like [PERCENT] to the [NORP], and then we come in with the big red wave. It is going to be a wave like nobody's ever seen, because our people want to get out and vote. So they will start big heavy when it gets the early voting, but especially on [DATE], we are going to be swamping it. But here is what happened. And this is early. So this is early, but still [CARDINAL] of votes. Here is what happened. We are supposed to be down big, and then we catch it like a race horse. A race horse, Secretariat would start off and [inaudible 00:00:13:19]. That was what was supposed to sort of happen, and then you see what happens in the end. And I think we win. But something strange has happened in [GPE]. We brought back many car plants, many, many. They had not brought back a plant, I think it is [DATE], and we brought back many and expansion the car plant. In [GPE], a strange thing has happened. We are leading substantially in the early voting. What is that all about? What is that all about? Because something's happening out there. Look at it. Take a look at this crowd. You cannot see it. As far as the eye can see, you have people. As far as the eye can see. [DATE], the people of [GPE], and you know what? We win [GPE], we win the whole ballgame. What the hell do you think I am doing here on a freezing night with [QUANTITY] winds. What do you think? Do you think I am doing this for my health? I am not doing this for my health. I am doing it for that, and I am doing it for that. Look how beautiful that is. Wow. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. [DATE], the people of [GPE] must stop these [NORP] radicals by issuing [PERSON]. He has no clue anyway. Look, let us not kid ourselves. Let us not kid ourselves. He is shot. Okay? I do not care. Think of it, think of it, because this puts pressure on you. I am running against perhaps in the history of presidential politics, the worst candidate. [PERSON] would not even endorse him. They ran together, they were [inaudible [TIME]]. And then even after he won, I did not think [PERSON] It took so long, right? Now I heard that [DATE], they said, Sir? What? Well, we have a little problem. What? [PERSON] is going to campaign for him. I said, Well, that is good news. He campaigned harder than [PERSON] did for [PERSON], and it just made us stronger. I want him to campaign so much. I want him to campaign, because we are going to do even better. But it is true, by issuing [PERSON], a tremendous defeat at the ballot box. But it is not [PERSON]. Remember this. It is a radical left sick ideology. An amazing poll just came out. [PERCENT] of the [NORP] people, [ORG] poll, right, say that they are better off [DATE] than they were [DATE] under the [PERSON]/Biden Administration. That is a record. That is a record. Think of what we are saying. By the way, that is a record, [PERCENT] of the people, and that is during, and we are rounding the corner, we got the vaccines, all that, but even without it, we are rounding the corner. You will see it. We are rounding the corner. Unbelievable. The vaccines are unbelievable. Frankly, except for a little politics, but we have unbelievable vaccines are coming out real soon, and the therapeutics are unbelievable, and the cures. Excuse me. I am here. I did not feel so good, I will be honest with you. I had not been sick in a long time. I do not have any time to get sick. It is good. If you are busy, you do not get sick because you have no time. You do not think about it. But I was not feeling so good. I was not feeling like your president has to feel. I was not feeling like [PERSON]. All of a sudden, the doctor, we have great doctors. [CARDINAL] thing with being president, you got more doctors than any human being. I am lying down in a bed, I got [CARDINAL] doctors from [ORG], university, great people, all great. Talented, great people. And they love their president. They love their country. But I have doctors, they wanted to touch every single part of my body. I said, Doctor? You know what? I did not feel great. There is a drug, it is [ORG]. It is a transfusion. All I know is [TIME] I felt stronger than I have ever I wanted to get out there and I wanted to make new trade deals for your jobs, and I wanted to deal a lot of things. We have done a great job. A lot of jobs. It is just a great job. But the most menacing aspect of the [PERSON]/[PERSON] agenda is their attack of law and order. I was a big part. I came in and I had your sheriff, and what a great guy, [PERSON], I had your sheriff's endorsement and a lot of other endorsements in [GPE]. You ever hear of a place called [GPE]? Because if I did not get involved, there would be no [GPE] right now. There would not be one. I wish they called earlier. I wish we could have gotten in a little bit earlier, but that is okay. Say what you want. I will tell you what. I give your governor credit. Unlike [GPE], because we could solve [GPE] in [TIME] I'd say, [TIME]. They are antichrist, they are wise guys. They live in the basement with their parents. Not with [PERSON], but with their parents. Different basement. A different basement. They go home with their parents, but wise guys, right? [ORG], radical left. You know nobody likes to say it. They are [ORG], they are radical left, but they are wise guys. We can solve that in [TIME], but they do not want to do it. At least you governor said, Let us go in and let us solve the problem. And we solved it. It was late, but better late than never. But we solved and we saved [GPE]. And I want to thank the sheriff and I want to thank the chief, I want to thank all of the law enforcement that was there. I want to thank the people that were helping rebuild their stores and their businesses. [GPE]. I never thought of [GPE] that it would be an important part of my life. But if it did become because it was a terrible scene and it was not their fault, it was not their fault. But I will tell you what. Your law enforcement did a great job, we did a great job, and I want to thank everybody involved. Our law enforcement in this country, if you let them do fairly what they do better than anybody in the world, they would not have any problem. They would not have any problem. You look at what is going on in [GPE] under [NORP]. You look at what is going on in [GPE] under [NORP], [GPE], [GPE] under [NORP], [GPE] under [NORP]. We have a great young [ORG] woman, hopefully running in [GPE]. She is going to be fantastic. I hope she gets her shot, [NORP]. I hope she gets her shot. [DATE], I want to explain to you the threat that their far left plans pose to the safety of your family, your community, and your country. If you give the power to [NORP], the radical left will defund, disband, disarm, and dismantle police departments all across [GPE]. Ask if he supports slashing police funding. You saw this [DATE]. He said, Yes, yes. Absolutely yes. Honestly, look, he did not even understand the question, but that is what he said. It is just like fracking, right? He said, There'll be no fracking for [DATE]. There'll be no fracking. Then he gets lucky. [PERSON] refuses to get out so [PERSON] can have the nomination. [PERSON] lucks into it on [DATE], and now he is standing in [GPE] and they want to frack because they have [CARDINAL] fracking jobs and because we are energy independent and things. He goes from saying for [DATE], There will be no fracking. I wanted to put on a screen, but it was so windy we would've needed [CARDINAL] cranes to hold up the screen. Would have been a giant sail. But we have it. He says no fracking like [CARDINAL] times. He then becomes the nominee. Goes to [GPE], which we are going to win, too. Because in [GPE], I know it, I went to school there, in [GPE], they believe in law and order, and they believe in energy, and they believe in intelligence. Okay? They believe in intelligence. He now goes to [GPE], he gets hit hard, and he all of a sudden says, I never said that. There will be fracking. First of all, always follow with these politicians, because I have only been doing this for a short while. How the hell did I become president? No, I have only been doing it for a short while, but [CARDINAL] thing I have learned But I have known politics. I have been dealing on the other side of politics. [CARDINAL] thing, it is the first thing they say that always matters. And he said it for a long time, along with everybody else in his party, and there is no way he could not do what he did not agree to in the first place. He gets up and he says, In [GPE], no, no, we will frack. We will frack. And the whole place, and not one, see all the fake news media back there, nobody said to him, But for [DATE], you said there'd be no fracking, and now you said there'll be fracking. Nobody asked him that question. It is an incredible thing. You know why? Because they are fake news. Only in [GPE] could this happen. I know you well. As long as I am president, we will never defund the police. We will strongly defend our police. I will always stand with the heroes of law enforcement. I think I am endorsed by every law enforcement group all over the country, beyond the country. I get world endorsements. It is the craziest thing. I said, I never knew I was that militant, and I am not militant. Do you know what? I want common sense. I want people to be safe. I want people to be safe. The [PERSON] plan calls for abolishing cash bail. That is wonderful. You have a murderer. They want to abolish so there are people all over. Look at what happened to [GPE]. They abolished cash bail. Your crime went up like [PERCENT]. It is terrible. And it is common sense. It is not like you have to be tough or not tough. It is common sense. They are going to release [CARDINAL] 000 criminals onto your streets and into your neighborhoods if crazy [PERSON] becomes president. It is not even conceivable. No, no, running against him, it is put such pressure, because I am running against No, no, running against him, it puts such pressure because I am running against the worst in the history of presidential. And now if I lose, can you imagine? If I lose, I will have lost to the worst candidate, the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. If I lose, what do I do? I'd rather run against somebody who is extraordinarily talented. At least this way, I can go and lead my life. But we are not going to lose, we are going to win. We are going to win at numbers. We are going to win in numbers. Right? Now, that is why I cannot lose. That might be the second most important. You know what the first most important is? Because we are going to make [GPE] greater than ever before. That is what the first Their plan also includes disarming law abiding citizens, namely taking away your second amendment. Think of it. While turning the entire country into [CARDINAL] giant sanctuary for criminals, illegal aliens, including those charged with rape, assault, murder, killing. The wall is almost built. I am very proud of that because any guy, being a developer, you just learn how to do it. But we had an entire, very powerful party. That is all they have. They have [CARDINAL] things. They have a very powerful [NORP] party that always sticks together. They do not have any of these rebels that we have in [ORG]. I call them stupid people. I call them stupid, stupid people because they play right into the hands. But the [NORP] really do not have that. They have [CARDINAL] things. They stick together like you have never seen. They are smart, and they are vicious. Like, Let us impeach him even though he did nothing wrong. They are vicious. They are vicious. Now, what we have is we have much better policies like how about we want a strong border? They do not want to have a border. They want to have open borders, right? We do not want sanctuary cities. We do not want to protect criminals. We want jobs, we want low taxes. We have a lot of good things, but I tell the [NORP] all the time, a lot of peoples have a lot of influence over the party so you got to get tougher. You got to get only fairer, but you got to get meaner, but you got to get tougher because they play a tougher game. But we have these rebels. And they think they are hot stuff. By the way, they usually end up outside of politics in a very short time. We make sure of that. For [DATE], [PERSON] was silent as radicals, anarchists, arsonists, and vandals rampaged through [NORP]-run cities in [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and other places. [PERSON] called them peaceful protesters. Remember the guy on [ORG]? He is standing there and he said, This is a peaceful But his hand is shaking. This is a peaceful I have no idea, it is [PERSON], I have a really good [PERSON], shaved head, right? Shaved his head. I am thinking about doing that. That way I do not have to worry about that. I do not have to worry. No, he shaved it all off, he does not have to worry about How does it look, darling? How does it look, First Lady? Darling, you are the most handsome president. I said, First Lady, am I the most handsome president ever? Yes, absolutely. I said, Who could top me? Well, she said, Well, [PERSON] was good looking, but nothing like you. Nothing like you, darling. Thank you. Now you go home and you see this crazy [ORG]. Fortunately, their ratings are terrible, which is bad. But you will see them say, [SPEAKER] said he is better looking than [PERSON]. You will see it. They are sick people, they got a lot of problems. But fortunately, they are not doing so well. [DATE], rioters laid waste to suburban residential neighborhoods just outside of [GPE]. [PERSON] will appease the rioters and the looters and the anarchists, and I am having them arrested. You know what we are doing. We are having them arrested. And you know when they knock down statues, you notice that is very much stopped. Certainly with federal statues. A little thing happens, it is amazing how quickly it stopped. They go to jail for a period of [DATE]. It is amazing. They were getting all set to take down the incredible statue of [PERSON] right by [FAC], right? And I said, We cannot let that happen. And I will tell you what. The police went out and they charged. It was an incredible thing. Because [DATE], everyone wants to be so damn politically correct. The police are afraid if they touch somebody or speak to somebody rudely, there'll be destroyed, their pension will be gone, their family will be gone. No, we got to protect our police, we have got to take care. They got to be fair. And you are going to have problems and you are going to have mistakes. And people will choke. They will choke, they have a decision to make. They have [TIME] sometimes to make. And you will have some bad cops. And we got to do something about those bad cops. And that happens. But [CARDINAL], I mean, they are the most incredible people and they keep us safe. Right? They keep us safe. They keep us safe. So we have to take care of them. [DATE], [CARDINAL] law enforcement officers have been viciously attacked. Nobody talks about that. Nobody talks about that. Several police officers have been very, very brutally murdered. You saw [DATE] with the [CARDINAL] sitting in a car. And I mean, that is just a horrible thing. The anti-police rhetoric of [PERSON] and the [NORP] party is really what causes a lot of this too. But it puts police officers in harm's way. It really puts them in harm's way. We cannot let that happen. [PERSON] referred to police as the enemy, he just referred, the enemy, quote, quote, the enemy. And vilified them as an oppressive racist force. I mean, this guy has gotten just beaten up. He does not believe that. I really do not believe I should not say that. But I do not believe he believes it. [PERSON]'s running mate, oh, how do you like her? Did [PERSON] do a great job? Did our great vice president do a great job? Never let you down. It was just too easy. I said, [PERSON], that was just too easy. oh, she was just terrible. She was terrible. I mean, I could not believe he picked her. And I have said it a lot. She treated him worse than any would have. [CARDINAL] candidates, right? [CARDINAL] for this job. I could tell them it is not that easy. Well, do not forget. We have done more than any administration in [DATE] in the history of our country. We have rebuilt our military, we have cut more regulation than any other administration by a factor of a lot. And we all did this. We have more federal judges by the end of the first term than any other administration. In fact, percentage wise, the only one that has more, there is [CARDINAL] president that has more percentage wise, not the number. Because we will have [CARDINAL], maybe even more than that by the end of the first term. But there is [CARDINAL] president that has a higher percentage than I have. Do you know who that is? [PERSON]. Give him a hat. Give him a Make America Great Again hat. We will say, Make America Great Again hat. Again, again. We made it great again and now we are going to make it great again because we had to close it up, save [CARDINAL] lives, and now we are opening it up and we are doing record numbers. And you will hear. [PERSON]'s running mate and [GPE]'s most liberal Senator, [PERSON], recently urged their supporters to donate to a fund that bailed out the rioters that did so much harm and even physical damage to people, but damage in [GPE]. And they wanted to bail them out of jail. And she was heading up a group to get them out of jail. And including a really bad attempted cop killer. He attempted killing a policeman. [CARDINAL] members of [PERSON]'s staff donated to the same fund. By the way, they talk about fundraising, right? I am good at fundraising. I could be the greatest fundraiser in history. I am the president of [GPE]. I am a really smart guy like you are. But I will tell you what, think of this. Think of this. If I wanted to pick up a phone and call Wall Street, say the FIG firms, say, Yeah, I got to raise X dollars. They will do it, every one. I mean, it is so easy. It is so easy. I could have more money. The problem is if you do that, what happens is when they call you in [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] because they need something, you got to take their call and you got to do it. So [PERSON] is raising a lot of money because they are promising all these things to all these people. Now, I have a much better platform because I am the president, right? I could raise money. And then the fake news goes out and says, You know what? We are doing great. We are doing great on the small donors. The small donors, like $[MONEY] a piece and stuff. But I could raise more money than anybody in the history of politics. But I do not want to call these people and say, Do me a favor, the head of [ORG]. I do not want to say, Do me a favor. All these people. Nobody could ever raise money like me. I just do not want to do it because it puts us all, meaning us, I did this for us, not for me. Believe me. I did not do it for me. I lost a fortune. This job has cost me [MONEY], [CARDINAL]. They do not like to say that. [MONEY]. And yet, if a man from [GPE] comes up and stays at one of my hotels for $[MONEY]. 13, takes a room. [DATE], [SPEAKER] takes [NORP] as a guest in one of hotels. I mean, [CARDINAL] I lost. And that is okay because I am doing something that is the most important thing I have ever done. I do not care. There are a lot of rich people around. What the hell difference does it make? But I have lost [CARDINAL]. And I never talk about it. They never talk about it. So I get paid, I guess, $[MONEY], [MONEY], $[MONEY], [MONEY]. And I give up my salary. I do not get it. You do not read that. You do not read it. Because you know what? It is not good for them to say that. And I do not talk about it. But [TIME], I will talk about it. So I get the highest salary because you are the president. And I give it up, I do not take it. So that is nice. I would say it costs me [MONEY]. And all the work. I have good kids. They do not do jobs. Can you imagine if they wanted to go to the Middle East and do jobs all over the place? I'd have hotels being built in every city, in every country in the world. And I have great kids and they are ambitious kids. They'd like to do it. I say, You cannot do it. And by the way, there is no legal reason you cannot do it. But there is a big reason, psychologically. You can not go to [GPE] and all these different places that we protect and we do all these things and that buy a lot of our planes and a lot of our everything, you cannot allow them. You cannot allow them. So that is way it is. But I would be the greatest fundraiser in the history of politics. But if you do not mind, we do not need the money. And we will not do it that way. But they are raising a lot of money. And every time I see them raising a lot of money, I say, because I know exactly what is going on, Deals are being made. Especially when you look at [PERSON]. I mean, look at what is going on with that family. The [NORP] party's war on cops is driving police officers to leave their jobs in record numbers. No one is hurt more by the left wing crusade against law enforcement than [NORP]. They are hurt the most. And you look at it and you know it. [DATE], and by the way, large percentages of our police men and women are [NORP]. It is a [NORP] community. [DATE], in [CARDINAL] [NORP]-run cities, [CARDINAL] [NORP] were murdered as a result of violent crime. [DATE], murders in [NORP] cities have increased by [PERCENT]. And we'd help them. We'd help them. We want to help them. We say, Call. I say, Call. They do not want to call. [CARDINAL] of the victims are [NORP]. [PERSON] and the left ignore these [NORP] victims. I never will. We are never going to ignore them. We have done more for the [NORP] community than any president with the exception of [PERSON]. It is true. It is true. Criminal justice reform. [PERSON] could not do it. I do not even think he tried to do it, frankly. But he could have never done it. [PERSON] could not do it, none of them could do it then. And it was desperately needed. Criminal justice reform, I did it. Prison reform, we did it. We did things nobody How about opportunity zones? Right. So great for [NORP], so great for the [NORP] community, the jobs. We worked on that with a great senator from [GPE], [PERSON]. Great senator. Historically Black colleges and universities. You went to [CARDINAL]. Oh, which one did you go to? I love them. Very good, that is a good one. I do not know if I could have gotten in, that is too good. That is too tough. That is a good one, right? That is good. Well, anyway, they have to be happy with me. But listen, so after [DATE], [DATE], every year a group of [CARDINAL] people, [CARDINAL], [DATE], they'd come up, the head people at all of these colleges, and they'd come up and I'd see him. And [DATE] I saw them, I thought it was routine and they were up because they needed money for the colleges. I said, Oh, that is interesting. Second year, I said, What are you doing back here? Why are you back? Said, We have to come [DATE]. For [DATE], they have been coming up [DATE]. And then I see them [DATE] and I say, Wait a minute, let us get this straight. You mean you come up here [DATE] to beg for money? He said, We beg for money. And we feel like beggars. [CARDINAL] gentleman was great. He told me exactly those words. He said, They make us come back [DATE]. [PERSON] never did it. [PERSON] never did it. And I said, So wait, here is what we are going to do. We are going to get you long-term funding. And here is what I did. I got them more money than they were asking for. And now for a [DATE] period. And I said, The only bad news is I may never see you again. I may never see you again. But we did that for the [NORP] community. And we did a lot of other things. And I say that nobody's done more for the [NORP] community. With all of that, the biggest thing of all is criminal justice reform. You know about [PERSON]. And we have so many people like [PERSON]. She is an incredible person. Ask yourself this question. Do you want to vote for the candidate supported by [NORP] rioters? Or do you want to vote for the candidate supported by so many of our great people and the heroes of law enforcement? And that is what it is. [PERSON] made a speech, I think it was [DATE]. I mean, he makes so few of them. I think he stays in his place in [GPE]. And I like [GPE], but does he ever leave [GPE]? Right? But he made a speech. There was nobody in the audience. And they never say this. They never say it. We come here, take those cameras and show them please. Please, okay. No, I am telling you, [DATE], I think the camera slipped. Because in his case, they should not show the audience. In our case, they should. And the camera must have slipped. And there was nobody there. He is speaking and there is nobody there. And I am saying nobody reports that. And he never leaves his little area. And you know, I will tell you what, as president of [GPE], I met with Gold Star families [DATE], I meet with a lot of people. I have an obligation. I cannot lock myself into a basement in [FAC]. I cannot lock myself into a beautiful bedroom at the top of [ORG] where there is no risk, no nothing. I am the president of [GPE]. And I would often say, I meet people, and these are incredible, like the Gold Star families. They lost sons and daughters and husbands in [GPE] and [GPE] and other places. And I cannot say, I want to cancel the meeting. And I met [CARDINAL] families. And when they come up to you, and they are close, and they were tested and all. But there is questions all about everything, right? There is a very difficult situation. And when they come up to you and they want to say, My son was so brave, and they want to tell you the story, it is amazing. I mean, their son died [DATE]. This is in almost all case. I say, So tell me what happened. Sir, my daughter was a helicopter pilot and she was so good. She was so good, sir. And she was shot down, sir, in [GPE]. And then they tell me what happened and how brave and how great. And I cannot say, Do me a favor. You just cannot do that. And I say, every time I meet with groups of people, it is not all like that. It is also other people. And you meet with [inaudible 00:18:17]. But I cannot cancel, like cancel culture. They want to cancel everything, right? I cannot cancel these people. I have to take care of our people. And every time I do it, I say, It is risky. And sure as hell, I caught it. And now, I guess they say I am immune. I am immune. And I got better fast. I got better fast. I can now jump into the audience and give you all a big kiss. The women and the men, I will kiss. I will even kiss the men. I will kiss those big powerful men down there. I will not love it, but I will kiss them. Anyway, so no, it is an incredible thing. But I have an obligation. Somebody said, Why did you do this? Why did you do that? I said, Because these meetings are so important to people and you are the president. And I cannot do that. And I always said after, I said, Boy, that is risky probably, I guess. But whatever it is. And really, I got really well taken care of. And I really believe that this therapeutic or this cure, it was incredible. And we are going to make what I had available to everybody free. Free. It is incredible. The antibody. I think the antibody is the best thing. We are going to make it free. And it is been incredible, what we have been able to do. If you support our police, if you stand with the heroes of law enforcement, then you must defeat the [NORP] on [DATE]. You have to do it. You have to do it. And by the way, I hate to say it. I got a little briefing. I have been here before, but I got a little briefing on the area. This is a [NORP] area. But it is a [NORP] area that really likes [SPEAKER] a lot. And a lot of us are really great, really great workers. And the workers like me. You know who does not like me? The heads of the union, they never like me. You know who does like me? The people in the union, they like me. But I will tell you, this is largely a lot of [NORP]. And many people in this audience are [NORP], but they are [NORP] that are going to vote for [SPEAKER]. And we do great here. We do great here. And I appreciate it. And I take care of our workers and I take care of jobs. And [GPE] will not get away with what they got away with. They are not going to get away with it. Not going to get away with it. We just finished an incredible trade deal. In fact, [DATE], the largest order of corn in the history of our country, the largest order of soybeans in the history, the largest beef order, cattle, the beef order. And all of that is good, but you know what? Not the same. Does that make sense to you? It does not mean what it would have meant had they not put us through. Because they stopped it from going into [GPE], but they did not stop it from going to the rest of the world, including our country, Europe, the rest of the world. So your [NORP], some of them By the way, just seriously, I am just curious, raise your hand if you are a Seriously, I am going to do a poll that costs nothing, right? I like these polls that cost nothing. They do a poll, it costs [MONEY]. They interviewed like [CARDINAL] people, right? Then they wonder why their polls are off. We have interviewed [CARDINAL] people. They over-sample [NORP] by [PERCENT]. [SPEAKER] is down [CARDINAL]. I said, Yeah, but you are interviewing mostly [NORP]. You ever see that? I guess there must be a legal reason why they have to put it, but they over-sample by [PERCENT] , [PERCENT], [PERCENT]. How about last election? So I was down in [CARDINAL] places that I had to win. That was not a good feeling. Wake up, how are we doing? Well, you are down at [CARDINAL] places. By [TIME], I won [CARDINAL] places. Think of it. Other than that, they did a great job of polling. They even had me believing it for awhile. But what I did not believe, because we had a lot of spirit [DATE], and by the way, nothing like we have now. This is far greater. This is still [DATE] out. And it sounds like very little, but that is a lot. That is a lot. Normally, a crowd like this would be for [TIME] before for a candidate, [CARDINAL] time shot. We have this all over. You ought to see what we had in [GPE], in [GPE]. We were in [GPE], we had, I think, [CARDINAL] 000 people. All over. We were in [GPE]. We just got back from [GPE]. I mean, it is like this. But the spirit, we have much more spirit now than we ever had [DATE]. And we had a record. A record. But you know what? The media is more corrupt and they are worse. It is not really [PERSON]. She was tougher, she was smarter. Look, [PERSON] was a lot smarter than [PERSON], let us not kid ourselves. She was a better candidate. Well, I do not know. Look, we will see how it all turns out, right? What is a better candidate? But she was much sharper, she was much smarter. But it is not that. The media has become crazed, and the big tech companies have become crazed. They will not let the fact that we caught him in a total corrupt deal, they will not let the news get out. And in all fairness to [PERSON], I have my own problems with [PERSON], but at least [PERSON] is letting it out. And I will tell you who is incredible. A newspaper called [ORG], the oldest paper in [GPE]. It is the fifth largest paper in [GPE]. And they are all in to finding out about all of this [PERSON]. Forget about the family, [PERSON] Well, there is [PERSON] Forget about the family, [PERSON]. I mean, it really is. It is really corruption, but it is [PERSON] corruption. So we are thrilled to be here with some incredible people and you are going to be joined by a man And I mean this too. And you know, I say, Oh, everybody's wonderful, and then half the time you cannot stand them, but you got to say it, but this guy is wonderful. He is [CARDINAL] of the smartest people in the [ORG]. A lot of people do not know that. See, I know that because I do a lot of very complex things. And there are not a lot of people that understand, but he understands and nobody understands finance better. But now what he is doing on, he is the chairman of [ORG], what he is doing on corruption is unbelievable. And I am very proud of your state for a lot of reasons, but [CARDINAL] of the reasons is that you have a senator named [PERSON]. Where is [PERSON]? Come here, come here. Come here, [PERSON]. Would you get him up please? Get him up. Come on, [PERSON]. I got to get him up. He deserves it. He deserves it. Come on, [PERSON]. Come on. Secret service is worried about it. Do not worry about it. He is one of the greatest people. He is one of the greatest senators. And I guess, whenever the hell you are running, I will be here for you. I will tell you that. Please say a couple of words. Senator [PERSON]: Well, thank you, Mr. President, as I was saying in the pre-program, what I admire about [SPEAKER] is his tenacity. The unfair treatment in the press by the [NORP], by the deep state, it does not deter him. He gets up [TIME]. He wants to make [GPE] great. And he talked about the First Step Act. I was a witness. That criminal justice reform was dead. It was going nowhere until [SPEAKER] stepped up to the plate and made sure he got it done and he did. Another piece of legislation that is very dear to my heart, was something again, it was dead, it was going nowhere, it is called Right to Try. Senator [PERSON]: And, Mr. President, I will never forget in that State of Union Address, you start talking about this bill that I'd been championed and you have not said the name yet. I am going, I think he is talking about Right to Try. And all of a sudden, he goes, We have to pass Right to Try. And I do not know if you saw me spring up like a jack in the box. But again, that is [[PERSON]]'s leadership. He does not get credit for it, but he wakes up [DATE], like the rest of you, loving this country and doing everything can to make it a greater country. God bless you. God bless [SPEAKER]. Thank you. [crosstalk [TIME]] He is a great guy. Do not lose him. [PERSON], when are you up? Next time [DATE], right? Do not lose him. I will be here, [PERSON]. I will be fighting for you. No, he is really a great guy and I am glad you came up and I am glad to have you around. And really, we are very proud of you. We have some warriors with us and people that have been with us through the fake impeachment, the hoax. That was one of the great hoaxes. And do not forget, we have done, and [PERSON] understands better than maybe anybody, we have done more in [DATE], then any administration [DATE], than any administration in the history. He'd mentions Right to Try, that is where a person is terminally ill and they cannot get a medicine that looks real good, but it has not been approved because it has to go through this long process, which we have cut in [CARDINAL] by the way. But they cannot get, so now they sign a document and it was very complicated, but not for me, it was not complicated. I said, You take the liability away. But we had problems with the insurance companies because they did not want We had problems with everybody, including the country. They did not want to get sued. So people would go all over the world, if they had some money, if they did not have money, they'd go home and they just die. And now if we have something that may work, but it is [DATE] away, [DATE], they sign just a quick waiver. And we have had Right to Try. And [PERSON], I do not know if you know, the success rate. It is been unbelievable, the number of people. This is not just trying. We have kept people alive and healthy and well and fully recovered. It is a very great thing. And I could never understand it, because for [DATE] I said, Why would not they give somebody who is terminally ill the drug? And because they say, We do not want to get sued, because they will get sued. The family will sue or something happens. I mean, I understand it all. But we got it done, they sign a waiver and we got it done. And the effects And you know what else happened? A side effect that nobody thought too much about. These companies that are trying to prove that their drug works, I will tell you, if it works there, it works everywhere. It is incredible. And they are able to be able to speed it up, where they speed them up because we have had some unbelievable stories. [CARDINAL] in particular that I know, a young lady who spoke at the national convention, [ORG], but the success rate has been incredible. So I want to thank you for that. You are right, you are one of the real authors of it. We want to also thank [PERSON]. [PERSON] has been incredible. He is been from the beginning by me and I want to thank you, [PERSON], for what you have done. A young, beautiful gentlemen, [PERSON]. Hi, [PERSON]. What a job he is doing, what a job. This is your deal over here, right? This is good. This is it. Keep him happy. I will tell you, he has a big future. Thank you very much for being here. And everybody knows [PERSON]. [PERSON], thank you. Great job. Warriors. Warriors, you really are. You are all great in [GPE]. You are producing good in [GPE]. What can I tell you? The [GPE] [ORG] Chairman, [PERSON]. Where is [PERSON]? Thank you, [PERSON]. How are we doing [PERSON]? Going to win this state? We got to win it. We got to win it. By the way, I wanted to say before [PERSON] interrupted me So who is a [NORP] here, just raise your hand? Okay. That is a lot. Seriously, do not worry about your hand, we all love you. Who is a [NORP] here? [NORP], you better get out there and win, huh? We really do. No, we appreciate it. We have a lot of them over there too. We have a lot of [NORP], but we really do appreciate it. Because ultimately, we are looking for the same thing. We are looking for unity. We are looking for [CARDINAL] country. And the question was asked [DATE] and they said, What about bringing the country together, because I want that? And I said, We were there. Before the [GPE] virus hit us, we were there. And we were getting calls because the success was bringing us together as a country. We had the greatest employment numbers. We had the greatest [NORP] [NORP], [NORP], women, people with a diploma, people without a diploma, people that graduated first in their class at [ORG], everybody. We had [CARDINAL] people working. We never had anything like it. And I am telling you, I bet it was true with you guys, we were getting calls from people that you would least suspect and the country was coming together. Then we got hit by the [GPE] virus and it was back to the drawing boards. But the country was coming together, and it is going to come together. It is going to be a success. And [DATE] we are going to have [DATE] economically, I think, with what we have done. I also want to introduce the [NORP] candidate for [ORG] from [GPE], [PERSON]. [PERSON], great. I heard you were here, good. Good, good. I like it. [crosstalk [TIME]] That is great. Good luck. I hear you are doing well, [PERSON]. Good luck. Great to have you. Thank you very much. I will tell you what, [GPE] could use a new governor. That guy does not know what is happening. They got to open up that state. They got to open up that state. Kids have to get back to school. You know [PERSON] had it, right? They said [PERSON], [PERSON], my boy, my very tall young boy. He is very tall, but [PERSON] had it. And they said, Sir, he tested positive. And like [TIME], How is [PERSON] doing? Oh, he is all better. No, young people, they have, we hate to admit it, they have a very strong immune system, incredibly strong. We have to get back to school. Have to get back to school. You watch what happens. On [DATE], they will all say, All right. Now, everybody They are only doing this for politics. I really believe that, because they want the numbers to look as bad as possible. So whether it is your state or whether it is an [GPE] or whether it is [GPE] or whether it is [GPE]. Hey, we won the case in [GPE]. The courts have now forced her. They said it was unconstitutional what she was doing. The only person in the whole state that was allowed to have fun and go bowling and play tennis and do whatever he want, was the governor's husband, right? Her husband was free to do whatever he wanted. But other than that, it was like a prison she was operating. This election is a choice between a [SPEAKER] super recovery and a [PERSON] depression. And they are going to raise your taxes substantially, like [CARDINAL]. He is the only candidate All my life I have been involved in politics, never from the side. But [DATE] I said, Let us give it a shot, but I have always been around. This is the only time in my life. I always heard it was good to cut taxes. I said, How do you say we are giving a massive tax increase to everybody? And it is everybody, because you are getting [MONEY] a year from my tax cuts. We gave the greatest, the biggest tax cut in history and he wants to end the [SPEAKER] tax cut. Now he is saying, Well, I will not do that. It is same thing like fracking. You know, We are going to frack, frack Okay. He is just changed his mind. But he wants to end it, and do not forget child tax credit. That is [MONEY] for every child. So he is going to end all that. So he was going to end it, We are going to end He did not realize that the middle income people are getting a tremendous tax cut. And if you add energy to it, because they will drive energy through the roof. They want to end fossil fuel. They are going to end fracking. [PERCENT] they are going to end fracking. I mean, this guy goes around, We are going to end fracking, for [DATE]. Then he lucks out, gets the nomination. Because [PERSON] refused to do what she should have done, if she believes really in his philosophy of being a socialist, right? And he gets it. And as soon as he gets it, he says, No, no we are going to frack. It is the craziest thing I have ever seen. But if you add energy to it, right? You add energy, we are talking about [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], $[MONEY], 000 a family. That is a tremendous amount. There is never been anything like that. So if you vote for me, you will have the greatest If he gets in, he is going to raise your taxes like crazy. If he gets in And it is not him, again, it is his people that tell him what to do. If he gets in, you will have the greatest depression in the history of this country, your stocks will go to hell. Everyone thinks, Stocks, oh, it is rich people. Everybody owns stocks. You have 401ks. Who has a 401k here? That is a lot of people. Okay. Are you practically at your all time high, right? Your 401ks will be like wastepaper basket stuff. There'll be right there on the floor. You will have a depression the likes of which we have never seen, with the possible exception of [DATE], because I do not think it gets much worse than that. But you cannot do that, you cannot let this happen, because he will destroy everything we have done. Regulations, we cut more regulations than any administration in history. And regulation may be more important, in terms of jobs and everything, then even the biggest tax cut. It is the biggest tax cut in history. And I think the regulation cut, which is more than any president's done, no matter they were [DATE] or in [CARDINAL] case more, it does not matter. Our regulation cutting was the biggest. He wants to put them all back. That means all these companies that moved to [GPE], that moved to [GPE], that came here because of lower taxes, because of all of the things that we have done. It used to take [DATE] to get a highway built, to get a highway approved. We have got it down to [DATE]. And let me tell you, it may not make it. If it does not work environmentally or if it is unsafe, but at least you are going to know. We are trying to get it to [DATE], by the way and we are close to getting it. But it used to take, I mean, we have highways for [DATE], they have been trying to get approvals. And then after it gets approved, it is totally different and it costs [CARDINAL] of times more money. If you vote for me, prosperity will surge. Normal life will fully resume. And [DATE] will be [DATE] economically in the history of our country. [PERSON] would terminate our recovery with a draconian unscientific lockdown. I mean, not that you are already in it. And he will keep [GPE] locked up, locked down and closed for business. [PERSON] will shut down the country, delay the vaccine and prolong the pandemic. And companies will be afraid to invest in [GPE], if you have this happen, and our country. But you have a [NORP] governor, I do not know him but he is a nice guy probably. But I will tell you, companies, big companies, very strong companies, companies like as an example, [ORG], they do not want to invest with these people. They do not want to invest. They do not have any security. They do not have any They do not want to invest. I get in, companies like that will put more money in then they even promised. But they are very concerned, I mean, they have to have the right climate. So we are going to do things with [GPE], but we are going to do things with this country, like honestly has never even been done before and people will come together because of success. So we are delivering a safe vaccine very soon and a rapid recovery. [PERSON]'s plan will crush [GPE]. My plan will crush the virus and will make [GPE] greater than ever before. That is what is going to happen. It is going to happen fast. You have a spike, you have a surge. But if you remember it, [DATE], [GPE] had a big surge. It is now gone. The numbers are very down. It is totally open. [GPE] had a very big surge and now it is down. If you look at [GPE] had a big, big surge, all great governors and it is down. It is down to all low numbers, really low numbers. And you are going to have the same thing, but you got to open up. You got to open up, got to get the place going. [PERSON] is the living embodiment of the corrupt political class, that enriched itself while draining the economic life and soul from our country. I mean [DATE], and he just says, Well, I should have done this or that. I said, [PERSON], you were here for [DATE]. You never I always hated when he says that I should have done something. And he only left a short time ago. It was not like they were [DATE]. He is been at a high position for [DATE]. I said, [PERSON], you could have done something for [DATE]. [PERSON] shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, and you know it very well, you got to hit hard here, threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing [NORP] blood and treasure in endless wars that were ridiculous in countries that you'd never even heard of. And they are all coming back. They are all coming back. Got a lot of them, most of them are back. [PERSON] is and always has been a corrupt politician. I hate to say it. And the [PERSON] family is a criminal enterprise. It really is. It is a criminal enterprise. To be honest with you, he makes crooked [PERSON] look like an amateur. And [GPE] has already bought and paid for [PERSON]. Let me tell you, if [PERSON] became president, [GPE] will own this country, [GPE]. [GPE] will own They are paying us [MONEY] a year. I charged them [CARDINAL]. They never paid us [MONEY]. I gave [MONEY] to the farmers, many of them right here, [DATE] and [DATE], [DATE]. I said to [PERSON], Secretary of [ORG], great guy, How much have we been targeted for our farmers by [GPE]? He said, Sir, [DATE], [MONEY] and [DATE], [MONEY]. I said, That is good. We are going to target them. We took [MONEY]. We had [MONEY] left over that went to the [ORG], our treasury by the way. Our treasury, right into our treasury, not into [GPE]'s treasury, our treasury. But we had [CARDINAL] that went to the farmers, and a lot of you farmers got it. I also cut the tariffs between [GPE], what they were doing to you with [PERCENT] tariffs. So I am not just running against [PERSON]. I am running against the left wing media, the big tech companies. But if you think about it, the [NORP] and the media are one in the same. When you look at [ORG] and you look at fake news, [ORG], then you look at the fake [ORG], the failing [ORG] And the good news is, look Well, I do not even call it good news. But when someday I leave, whether it is in [DATE], [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] Now the story [DATE] will be with the fake news, He is a fascist he wants to take over No. No. But when, at some point, I leave, they are all out of business. They are going to go out of business. They know it too. That is why I expect someday they are going to all get together and say, Let us endorse him, because he is done a really good job. And they know that. This political class has nothing but disdain for you and for your values. They flood your communities with criminal aliens, drugs and crime, while living behind gated compounds in communities. They oppose school choice, so important is school choice, while sending their families to the best private schools. They attack the Second Amendment, while employing armed guards for themselves. They want to get rid of your Second Amendment. It is not going to happen with me, I promise. I do not think they will get [PERSON] on their side. [PERSON], can I have your pledge please? I will protect Okay. We got [PERSON]. Fellas, we have your votes. In [DATE], [GPE] voted to fire this corrupt and decrepit political establishment. And you elected an outsider as president to finally put [GPE] first. That is what you did. To defend our workers and our national security, I took the toughest ever action to confront [GPE]'s rampant theft of [NORP] jobs. When [GPE] targeted us, we targeted them. And it was very simple and now we are providing all sorts of everything, what we are doing for you. We have [MONEY] coming to help our farmers, in addition to all of the money that [GPE] paid our farmers, including [GPE]'s incredible dairy farmers. How is the dairy business, right? Anybody here do specialty milk. People do not realize though, specialty milk are very important. It is a very small part, but it was like the straw that broke the camel's back. Because I met with these guys and what they were doing, ripping you off on the big stuff, specialty milk. And anybody do specialty milk? I do not know. You know what? It is so small, but when I heard it, it was like [PERCENT]. Well, [DATE] are over. When the [GPE] timber industry was threatened, I imposed tariffs on dumped foreign goods and subsidized products, saving your timber jobs. And we have a long way to go. We can save a lot more. We got plenty of timber. I always say, Why the hell are we taking in timber from other countries? We have it all over the place. And if they ever manage their forests in [GPE] and other places, you would not have these forest fires. And part of that is cutting wedges. You have to cut wedges and all that stuff. And so we have so much timber. And I do not know, I guess we are just nice people, doing it from other lands, right? But we are doing good with our timber, we saved our timber jobs. If [PERSON] gets in, the radical left will shut down [GPE] timber production forever. They do not want to let you touch a tree. If you happen to touch a tree, they want to put you in jail for the rest of your life. I also issued brand new regulations to ensure [NORP] workers are first in line for jobs. We want [NORP] workers to be first in line. [PERSON] will allow his donors to bring in a flood of cheap foreign workers and wipe out your middle class. We do not want that happening. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in [GPE] history. Our Southern border is so secure. That wall, we are doing [QUANTITY] a week and we will be hitting [QUANTITY] within a period of [DATE]. And it'll be finished very soon. And by the way, [GPE] is paying for the wall, you do know. So finally, they said, Well, all right, he is built the wall. Let us not talk about the wall anymore. So now, whenever they go, But [GPE] is not paying. No, no. [GPE] is paying. We are putting a charge at the border and [GPE] is paying us for the wall. But [GPE] has been great to us, because they have [CARDINAL] 000 soldiers all along our Southern border. And I want to thank the President of [GPE], who happens to be a great guy. And they do have a big COVID problem. This is a good time to have a wall because we have that wall and it is not penetrable. It is just not. Remember, they used to talk about, We do not need a wall. That is obsolete, right? They wanted drones. Drones, little drones flying all over. You know what the drones would be good at, with cameras on them? So that we could watch all the people pouring into our [inaudible [TIME]] Right? They wanted drones. Remember crying [PERSON] You know [PERSON]? He cries anytime I have known him all his life, I have never seen him cry. But when he wants to get on camera, he cry so much. Crying [PERSON], I call him. Because he feels so sad, he feels so sorry for people. Ah, do not worry about it, he does not . But crying [PERSON], you understand what I mean. Crying [PERSON], what a beauty. [PERSON] looks like [bluh 01:11:53], because not a good guy. But crying [PERSON] was talking about walls are obsolete. I said, Walls are not obsolete. And he said, No, no. We need technology, drones obsolete. And he said, No, no, we need technology, drones. I said, Drones are not going to help you, other than I mean, they are nice. We have all sorts of attachments to the wall. This wall is technologically very advanced, and drones are fine, but you have got to have a wall. And then I said to a group of people, and they thought it was sort of cool, You know, you do a computer [DATE], you do a chip, you do anything [DATE], it is obsolete in [TIME], right? We have just developed a new computer. It is the greatest thing ever. [DATE], somebody does a better one, right? It is a horrible business. That is why I like real estate. You buy a good piece of land, that is good. I like it better, simpler, right? But you know what? Everything's obsolete in [TIME], except the [CARDINAL] things that you know what that is, I have been telling you, right? A wheel and the wall. In [DATE], you will come back and the [CARDINAL] things that you will have that are very modern will be a wheel and a wall. Look at the wall they built over there. They took trucks and they put them together because they do not want any criminals coming in here, so that is a wall. If they had a drone circling up there, our great [ORG], I think [ORG] would be, Who are the bad guys and who are the good guys? Look at that, they built a wall. That wall took them [TIME], but the [CARDINAL] things are a wheel and a wall, they will Everything else is going to be obsolete in [TIME]. In [DATE], we have arrested [CARDINAL] criminal aliens, including those charged with murder, assault, sex offenses. We have [CARDINAL] 000 murderers that [ORG] has apprehended in our great border patrol and we owe them a debt of gratitude. Think of that. Think of that, [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] murderers we took off the streets. In some cases they are so bad we did not even want to give them, we have to take I do not want to pay for them for the next long period of time. Frankly if it was up to me, I am a person that believes in the death penalty, but what are you going to do? So controversial. So we will end up keeping them for [DATE]. We will end up feeding them for [DATE]. But look, look, let me just tell you. We have what The job that [ORG] does and border patrol, and this guy's a tough guy. You do not want the job. You do not want it. You do not want it. There is a couple of guys could probably, maybe you'd be good at it, I do not know. He looks pretty tough. You got to be tough. These guys, the [ORG] guys, you will see these killers from the [ORG], they are total killers. Sit down, folks. They will Just relax. Look, they are so excited they will not sit down. Just sit down. But you get these killers They will be standing up in [TIME]. Well, that is a compliment, right? It should be a compliment, right? It is very nice. I appreciate it. But relax, relax. What the hell else do we have to do [TIME]? The fact is, does anybody have a better time than at a [SPEAKER] rally, right? But we do not call it a rally, we call it a friendly protest because, legally, if I call it a friendly protest, you are allowed to be here. If you call it a rally, you are entitled to [CARDINAL] people or something. So we said let us call it a protest. So everybody raise your hand, this is a protest, right? That is actually true. Under the [PERSON] administration, these criminals would be set free. Under the [SPEAKER] administration, these criminals are put in jail or they are sent home. We have to, we cannot do this. And by the way, the [ORG] gang members are the worst anywhere in the world. They do not even want, right, they do not even I hope you did not come into contact with one. No? You know too much about them. I do not know, I am worried about you. Stand up, I am worried about you. What the hell do you know so much about [ORG]? Look at that guy. He Oh, you are not. Is he with you? You know what can I be honest with you? If he is with you, you have no problem. You got no problem. Thank you. Thank you both very much. That is great. Great. But the [ORG], they are killers. They are horrible people. And these people go in and they go with they call them a nest, where they be standing and just run in and start swinging and fighting. And then they always come out on top. And you know what? There are not a lot of people that would be good at that job. We have to respect those people that protect us like this. Immigration security is national security. Remember that? And we have to have borders. A nation without borders is not a nation. We do not have a nation. So on behalf of [GPE], I'd like to extend my sincere, really sincere condolences to a friend of mine, President [PERSON] of [GPE], where they had [DATE], a vicious, vicious, [NORP] terrorist attack beheading, and just a teacher near [GPE], beheading. A horrible thing. And they have apprehended [CARDINAL] people, who knows. But we have been very, very strong on radical [NORP] terrorism. And we do have a ban. People said, Oh, that is such a terrible thing. Remember I put the ban o.n and then we got sued and we lost, lost, and then we wanted [ORG]. We have also invested and [GPE] is having a hard time and [PERSON]'s a great guy, and I just want to say whatever we can do. We have also invested [MONEY] with [MONEY] in the [GPE] military, which was totally depleted when we took office. Including major contracts to build new warships that saved the historic shipyard right here in [ORG] in [GPE]. We gave you [MONEY]. A lot of states wanted that contract, I gave it to you. And I came to [GPE] [DATE]. And they do a great job. But a lot of people wanted that. A lot of states wanted it. And it is okay. I am going to lose those states, but that is all right. Just remember that, [GPE]. But we gave it, it is a lot of jobs. It is actually a very big contract that gets bigger, but they do fantastic work. I looked at what they were doing. Incredible talented people. And you would have lost that ship yard. That is a big yard. You would have lost it, but we saved it. We have done plenty. We launched the first new branch of [ORG] in [DATE], [ORG]. I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous, [MONEY] for nothing. Plus [CARDINAL] in cash [GPE] nuclear deal. If and when we win, if we win, the first call I am going to get is from the head of [GPE]. And he is going to say, Let us make a deal. [GPE] their economy. Their GDP went down [PERCENT]. They are dying to make a deal. I said, Look, you want to really see the election because you are not going to be in a position. You got to see the election. The first call I get will be them. And then I will tell you the other calls, but I better not, because I am going to just make the deal harder if I do. But plenty of other nations are going to be calling because they are going to want to make deals. I recognize the true capital of [GPE] and opened the [NORP] embassy in [GPE]. I also recognize By the way, every president for many, many presidents, right, every single president said they were going to do that. And you went back how many presidents? [DATE]. And they all said they were going to do it. And they never did it because I will tell you what it was not easy. Once I got to office the pressure put on your president not to do it was incredible. And I told the story, I did not take phone calls. I got calls from kings and presidents and prime ministers. Not to do it. Do not do it, sir. Do not do it. We do not want you to do it. You know? It is going to be horrible if you do it, sir, it'll cause problems. Then finally I said, I will tell you what, who is calling? A king. Who is calling? An emir. Who else is calling? Prime ministers, presidents. In [CARDINAL] case, a queen. I was thinking about taking her call, but I [inaudible [TIME]]. And I said, No, no, no. What are they calling about? They want to talk you out of moving the capital of [GPE] to [GPE]. I said, Really? It is very important. Okay. Tell them that. I am going to call them back on [DATE]. I had the press conference on [DATE]. So I said, Tell them, I will call them back on [DATE]. I look forward to talking to them. I then announced that we were doing it. And we had [GPE] as the capital of [GPE]. And then I called back the heads of all these countries. Yes, King. What could I do for you, President of [GPE]? Well, I wanted to talk to you about [GPE], but it is already been announced. Oh gee, I wish I got to you a little bit soon. I am sorry. No, it is much, much easier than, like what do we need? So I got back to them. They were over disappointed. You know what? We opened and it was going to cost [MONEY]. And I said to my very talented, who was [CARDINAL] of the greatest lawyers in [GPE], [PERSON], a great lawyer. I said, [PERSON], see if you can get a piece of land cheap or a piece that we already own. Because they want to spend [MONEY] to build this thing. I said, We can do it cheaper. Calls me back [DATE], Sir, we have a piece of land with a building on it. I think we can renovate it for $[MONEY], 000. It will be nicer than the one they want to build. So we did it for [CARDINAL]. I actually first time in my life. I said, [PERSON], I have never said this before, it sounds too cheap. Make it [CARDINAL]. So instead of spending [CARDINAL], probably would've never got built. You can imagine the cost overruns everything else. And this was a better location, a bigger piece of land, a better view, better everything, safer, better part. We got there early. We have the best land, right? That is why I said it. I said, [PERSON], no matter where you are, we were always there first. Right? If you want a good building by a post office, it is always there. They were always there first. But we were there first. I said we must And he said, We have a great piece of land. The building, we fixed it. Was an empty building and it is beautiful. And we use [GPE] stone, which is a complicated thing. But I will not tell you about a very expensive, except if you happen to be in [GPE]. And it is a beautiful embassy and it is opened and now we have the capital and I will tell you something. Think of it. Every single president, you go back during their campaign. They used to campaign on it and nobody had the guts to do it, but we did it. Oh, look at you. We did it. Right? Did I do it? And we opened the embassy [DATE]. Can you believe that? Instead of [DATE], we would not have that thing open for [DATE]. I also recognized [NORP] sovereignty over the Golan Heights. [DATE], they worked on it. I got it done in [TIME]. And instead of endless war in the Middle East, we are forging peace without blood all over the sand. Okay, and countries are coming in and they all want to come in. The fact is I did more in [DATE] than [PERSON] did in [DATE], and it is true. What he did was distraught. And now the [NORP] are pushing the most far-left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. The [PERSON] plan would destroy your social security and destroy protections for people with pre-existing conditions. You do not know that. They want to spend all their money on this ridiculous Green New Deal for [MONEY]. It is crazy. Just OAC plus [CARDINAL]. A poor student has no idea about the environment. All of a sudden she is coming up with a Green New Deal. And we will not let them take your cattle. Do not worry about it. Your cattle are next. The cattle are next. [PERSON] vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions. And he wanted to search And they have agreed to this. This is the manifesto, I call it, with [PERSON]. Crazy [PERSON]. And surge refugee admissions by [PERCENT]. This is agreed to. Opening the flood gates to radical [NORP] terrorism. How is [GPE] doing? Not too good. You stayed in your country will be overrun and overwhelmed and it will never happen on my watch. Never, never, never, never, never. [PERSON] wants to ban school choice, the most important thing, school choice. And he wants to end charter schools, which have been so successful. Because he is controlled by a group. But with that, some of the most important people on this planet are teachers. Remember that. We love our teachers. We love our teachers. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in [GPE]. And when you talk about the black community, the [NORP] community, that is one of the great civil rights developments in our country. It is called school choice, right? One of the most important things we can do. School choice and charter schools, but school choice. A vote for [NORP] is a vote for safe communities, great job, just incredible jobs, and a limitless future for all [NORP]. It is really about the [NORP] Dream. The American Dream is alive and well. The American Dream is alive and well. Crowd: [DATE]. [DATE]. [DATE]. Thank you. Please. Thank you very much. And I will say again, again and again, had we not been hit with this virus, you would have seen things that like you have never seen before, but we are going to have it back there very, very soon. We are setting records. We are going to have it back very soon. So in conclusion, over [DATE], we will make [GPE] into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on [GPE] once and for all. We have already started. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. Second Amendment. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our children and our citizens. And we will keep [GPE] out of these endless and ridiculous foreign wars. We will maintain [GPE]'s unrivaled military might. We have the greatest military now in the world. When I took over [DATE], you know it and the military, our planes were old. Everything was old. Our missiles, our rockets, our nuclear, was not in the condition that had to be in. You never want to use it. You never want to use it. We hope to God, we never have to use it. Now we have the greatest weapons ever produced by a single country, not even close. The hydro-sonic missiles. I call them the super-duper missiles. They go [CARDINAL] times faster than a normal missile. Now President [PERSON] let that get away. They took our plans to [GPE] and other places. But now we have done because we had the technology like nobody else. So that missiles, rockets, ships, tanks from [GPE]. We make them in [GPE]. We kept the plant open. I kept that plant open. [GPE]. I kept the plant open. I said, You cannot close this plant. The plan was to close it. I said, You cannot . It is the only place in the country. I visited, went to [GPE] with [PERSON], a great guy. I visited. I saw the people and I saw the technology and the complexity. I said, You will never be able to build You will never be able to reproduce it. Anyway, we kept it open. And now it is working [TIME], around the clock. Okay. All made in the [GPE] New jets, the fighters F-35s, everything new. And when I took over our military and you know it, the military people, it was totally depleted. We now have the greatest We are the envy of [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] and every country in the world. There is nobody that has anything near our weaponry, and again, we hope to God, we never ever have to use it, but we will have peace through strength. That is what is it is all about. We will end surprise medical billing. Require price transparency, which goes into effect on [DATE]. And further reduce the cost of prescription drugs. I invoked a thing. You know that, what I did. You know, I invoked a favored nations clause. So we are going to pay whatever the lowest price in the world. I said, That is what we are going to pay. The difference is [PERCENT] reduction. I am not very popular, however, with big pharma. They are spending a of money on ads against me. When you see those ads, please remember your drug prices are coming down for a reason. The most powerful lobbyists in the world. They have the biggest lobby in the world by far, but is the only way. I mean, [DATE] what they were doing to people, no good. Or maybe we will make a deal with big pharma along the way, but they are spending a fortune of ads and that is okay. I mean, people get it. It is going to be the biggest price reduction. You are going to go down [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], [PERCENT] maybe [PERCENT], in some cases. We will strongly protect [ORG] and [ORG]. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. And they will not . [GPE] will land the first woman on the moon. And [GPE] will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We are getting very close. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great [NORP] flag. You. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust. For [DATE], you had a president who apologized for [GPE]. Now you have a president who is standing up for [GPE] and standing up for the great people of [GPE]. Get out and vote. So get your friends and get your family. Get your neighbors, get your coworkers. If you have a big and lazy boss, if you have a guy that is [QUANTITY] overweight, but he is a pretty good boss, but he is a little lazy, say, Boss, I am sorry, but you have to get up and you have to vote for [SPEAKER]. You got to get out and vote. And you can request an absentee ballot [DATE]. And if you already have one return that ballot right away, or just get out and vote. That is what I like. From [GPE] to [GPE], from [GPE] to [GPE], beautiful names. I love [GPE]. I love her. You know why? Children's clothing. I love it. I got plenty of it. Right? I know they laugh and they know I am right. I had plenty of it. And from [GPE] to right here in [GPE], we inherit the legacy of [GPE] patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for our beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of [NORP] heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out [FAC], laid down the railroads. I mean, think of these things. Think of these things. What we are talking about. Raised up the great giant skyscrapers, won [CARDINAL] World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made [GPE] the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater than ever before. That is what is happening. Proud citizens like you, helped build the country. Now you helped build this incredible country. And together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the [NORP] people, with your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, [CARDINAL] people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of [GPE], we have made [GPE] powerful again. We have made this country powerful like it is never been. We have made [GPE] wealthy again. Our stock market is just about at an all time high. Look at your stocks. Look at those 401Ks. How would you feel if it went down by [PERCENT]. It is going to only go up. We have made [GPE] strong again. We have made [GPE] proud again. We have made [GPE] safe again. And we will make [GPE] great again. Thank you, [GPE]. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentscommencementaddressbarnardcollegenewyorkcity", "text": "Please, please have a seat. Thank you. Thank you, President [PERSON], trustees, President [PERSON]. Hello, class of [DATE]! Congratulations on reaching [DATE]. Thank you for the honor of being able to be a part of it. There are so many people who are proud of you--your parents, family, faculty, friends--all who share in this achievement. So please give them a big round of applause. To all the moms who are here [DATE], you could not ask for a better [DATE] gift than to see all of these folks graduate. I have to say, though, whenever I come to these things, I start thinking about [PERSON] and [PERSON] graduating, and I start tearing up and----it is terrible. I do not know how you guys are holding it together. I will begin by telling a hard truth: I am a [ORG] graduate. I know there can be a little bit of a sibling rivalry here. But I am honored nevertheless to be your commencement speaker [DATE], although I have got to say, you set a pretty high bar, given [DATE]. [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], these are not easy acts to follow. But I will point out [PERSON] is doing an extraordinary job as one of the finest Secretaries of [ORG] [GPE] has ever had. We gave [PERSON] the Presidential Medal of Arts and Humanities. [PERSON] is not just a good friend, she is also one of our economic advisers. So it is like the old saying goes: Keep your friends close and your [PERSON] commencement speakers even closer. There is wisdom in that. Now, [DATE]--this area looks familiar----the year I graduated was [DATE], [DATE] women were admitted to [ORG]. [PERSON] was the first [NORP] woman in space. Music was all about [PERSON] and the moonwalk. We had the Walkman---- No, no moonwalking. No moonwalking [DATE]. We had the Walkman, not iPods. Some of the streets around here were not quite so inviting. [FAC] was not a family destination. So I know this is all ancient history. Nothing worse than commencement speakers droning on about bygone days. But for all the differences, the class of [DATE] actually had a lot in common with all of you. For we too were heading out into a world at a moment when our country was still recovering from a particularly severe economic recession. It was a time of change. It was a time of uncertainty. It was a time of passionate political debates. You can relate to this because just as you were starting out finding your way around this campus, an economic crisis struck that would claim [CARDINAL] jobs before [DATE]. Since then, some of you have probably seen parents put off retirement, friends struggle to find work. And you may be looking toward the future with that same sense of concern that my generation did when we were sitting where you are now. Of course, as young women, you are also going to grapple with some unique challenges, like whether you will be able to earn equal pay for equal work, whether you will be able to balance the demands of your job and your family, whether you will be able to fully control decisions about your own health. And while opportunities for women have grown exponentially over [DATE], as young people, in many ways you have it even tougher than we did. This recession has been more brutal, the job losses steeper. Politics seems nastier, [ORG] more gridlocked than ever. Some folks in the financial world have not exactly been model corporate citizens. No wonder that faith in our institutions has never been lower, particularly when good news does not get the same kind of ratings as bad news anymore. [DATE] you receive a steady stream of sensationalism and scandal and stories with a message that suggest change is not possible, that you cannot make a difference, that you will not be able to close that gap between life as it is and life as you want it to be. My job [DATE] is to tell you, do not believe it. Because as thing--as tough as things have been, I am convinced you are tougher. I have seen your passion, and I have seen your service. I have seen you engage, and I have seen you turn out in record numbers. I have heard your voices amplified by creativity and a digital fluency that those of us in older generations can barely comprehend. I have seen a generation eager, impatient even, to step into the rushing waters of history and change its course. And that defiant, can-do spirit is what runs through the veins of [NORP] history. It is the lifeblood of all our progress. And it is that spirit which we need your generation to embrace and rekindle right now. See, the question is not whether things will get better; they always do. The question is not whether we have got the solutions to our challenges; we have had them within our grasp for quite some time. We know, for example, that this country would be better off if more [NORP] were able to get the kind of education that you have received here at [ORG], if more people could get the specific skills and training that employers are looking for [DATE]. We know that we'd all be better off if we invest in science and technology that sparks new businesses and medical breakthroughs, if we developed more clean energy so we could use less foreign oil and reduce the carbon pollution that is threatening our planet. We know that we are better off when there are rules that stop big banks from making bad bets with other people's money; when insurance companies are not allowed to drop your coverage when you need it most or charge women differently from men. Indeed, we know we are better off when women are treated fairly and equally in every aspect of [NORP] life, whether it is the salary you earn or the health decisions you make. We know these things to be true. We know that our challenges are eminently solvable. The question is whether, together, we can muster the will--in our own lives, in our common institutions, in our politics--to bring about the changes we need. And I am convinced your generation possesses that will. And I believe that the women of this generation--that all of you--will help lead the way. Now, I recognize that is a cheap applause line when you are giving a commencement at [ORG]. It is the easy thing to say. But it is true. It is--in part, it is simple math. [DATE], women are not just [CARDINAL] this country, you are [CARDINAL] its workforce. More and more women are outearning their husbands. You are [CARDINAL] of our college graduates and master's graduates and Ph.D.'s. So you have got us outnumbered. After [DATE] of slow, steady, extraordinary progress, you are now poised to make this [DATE] where women shape not only their own destiny, but the destiny of this [ORG] and of this world. But how far your leadership takes this country, how far it takes this world, well, that will be up to you. You have got to want it. It will not be handed to you. And as someone who wants that future--that better future--for you and for [PERSON] and [PERSON], as somebody who is had the good fortune of being the husband and the father and the son of some strong, remarkable women, allow me to offer just a few pieces of advice. That is obligatory. Bear with me. My first piece of advice is this: Do not just get involved. Fight for your seat at the table. Better yet, fight for a seat at the head of the table. It is been said that the most important role in our democracy is the role of citizen. And indeed, it was [DATE] that the Constitutional Convention opened in [GPE] and our Founders, citizens all, began crafting an extraordinary document. Yes, it had its flaws, flaws that this [ORG] has strived to protect [perfect]* over time. Questions of race and gender were unresolved. No woman's signature graced the original document, although we can assume that there were founding mothers whispering smarter things in the ears of the Founding Fathers. I think that is almost certain. What made this document special was that it provided the space--the possibility--for those who had been left out of our charter to fight their way in. It provided people the language to appeal to principles and ideals that broadened democracy's reach. It allowed for protest and movements and the dissemination of new ideas that would repeatedly, [DATE] after [DATE], change the world, a constant forward movement that continues to [DATE]. Our Founders understood that [GPE] does not stand still. We are dynamic, not static. We look forward, not back. And now that new doors have been opened for you, you have got an obligation to seize those opportunities. You need to do this not just for yourself, but for those who do not yet enjoy the choices that you have had, the choices you will have. [CARDINAL] reason many workplaces still have outdated policies is because women only account for [PERCENT] of the CEOs at Fortune 500 companies. [CARDINAL] reason we are actually refighting long-settled battles over women's rights is because women occupy [CARDINAL] in [CARDINAL] seats in [ORG]. Now, I am not saying that the only way to achieve success is by climbing to the top of the corporate ladder or running for office. Although, let us face it, [ORG] would get a lot more done if you did. That I think we are clear about. But if you decide not to sit yourself at the table, at the very least you have got to make sure you have a say in who does. It matters. Before women like [PERSON] and [PERSON] and others got to [ORG], just to take [CARDINAL] example, much of federally funded research on diseases focused solely on their effects on men. It was not until women like [PERSON] and [PERSON] got to [ORG] and passed title IX, [DATE], that we declared women too should be allowed to compete and win on [GPE]'s playing fields. Until a woman named [PERSON] showed up at her office and had the courage to step up and say, you know what, this is not right, women are not being treated fairly, we lacked some of the tools we needed to uphold the basic principle of equal pay for equal work. So do not accept somebody else's construction of the way things ought to be. It is up to you to right wrongs. It is up to you to point out injustice. It is up to you to hold the system accountable and sometimes upend it entirely. It is up to you to stand up and to be heard, to write and to lobby, to march, to organize, to vote. Do not be content to just sit back and watch. Those who oppose change, those who benefit from an unjust status quo, have always bet on the public's cynicism or the public's complacency. Throughout [NORP] history, though, they have lost that bet, and I believe they will this time as well. But ultimately, class of [DATE], that will depend on you. Do not wait for the person next to you to be the first to speak up for what is right. Because maybe, just maybe, they are waiting on you. Which brings me to my second piece of advice: Never underestimate the power of your example. The very fact that you are graduating, let alone that more women now graduate from college than men, is only possible because earlier generations of women--your mothers, your grandmothers, your aunts--shattered the myth that you could not or should not be where you are. I think of a friend of mine who is the daughter of immigrants. When she was in high school, her guidance counselor told her, you know what, you are just not college material. You should think about becoming a secretary. Well, she was stubborn, so she went to college anyway. She got her master's. She ran for local office, won. She ran for [ORG] office, she won. She ran for [ORG], she won. And lo and behold, [PERSON] did end up becoming a secretary. She is [GPE]'s Secretary of Labor. So think about what that means to a young [NORP] girl when she sees a [ORG] Secretary that looks like her. Think about what it means to a young girl in [GPE] when she sees a Presidential candidate who looks like her. Think about what it means to a young girl walking in [GPE] right down the street when she sees a [ORG] Ambassador who looks like her. Do not underestimate the power of your example. This diploma opens up new possibilities, so reach back, convince a young girl to earn one too. If you earned your degree in an area where we need more women, like computer science or engineering, reach back and persuade another student to study it too. If you are going into fields where we need more women, like construction or computer engineering, reach back, hire someone new. Be a mentor. Be a role model. Until a girl can imagine herself, can picture herself as a computer programmer or a combatant commander, she will not become one. Until there are women who tell her, ignore our pop culture obsession over beauty and fashion and focus instead on studying and inventing and competing and leading, she will think those are the only things that girls are supposed to care about. Now, [PERSON] will say, nothing wrong with caring about it a little bit. You can be stylish and powerful too. That is [PERSON]'s advice. And never forget that the most important example a young girl will ever follow is that of a parent. [PERSON] and [PERSON] are going to be outstanding women because [PERSON] and [PERSON] are outstanding women. So understand your power, and use it wisely. My last piece of advice--this is simple, but perhaps most important: Persevere. Persevere. Nothing worthwhile is easy. No one of achievement has avoided failure--sometimes catastrophic failures. But they keep at it. They learn from mistakes. They do not quit. You know, when I first arrived on this campus, it was with little money, fewer options. But it was here that I tried to find my place in this world. I knew I wanted to make a difference, but it was vague how, in fact, I'd go about it. I--but I wanted to do my part to shape a better world. So, even as I worked after graduation in a few unfulfilling jobs here in [GPE]--I will not list them all----even as I went from motley apartment to motley apartment, I reached out. And I started to write letters to community organizations all across the country. And one day, a small group of churches on the South Side of [GPE] answered, offering me work with people in neighborhoods hit hard by steel mills that were shutting down and communities where jobs were dying away. The community had been plagued by gang violence, so as--once I arrived, one of the first things we tried to do was to mobilize a meeting with community leaders to deal with gangs. And I'd worked for [DATE] on this project. We invited the police, we made phone calls, we went to churches, we passed out flyers. [TIME] of the meeting, we arranged rows and rows of chairs in anticipation of this crowd. And we waited, and we waited. And finally, a group of older folks walked in to the hall and they sat down. And this little old lady raised her hand and asked, Is this where the bingo game is? It was a disaster. Nobody showed up. My first big community meeting, nobody showed up. And later, the volunteers I worked with told me, that is it, we are quitting. They'd been doing this for [DATE] even before I had arrived. They had nothing to show for it. And I will be honest, I felt pretty discouraged as well. I did not know what I was doing. I thought about quitting. And as we were talking, I looked outside and saw some young boys playing in a vacant lot across the street. And they were just throwing rocks up at a boarded building. They had nothing better to do--[TIME], just throwing rocks. And I said to the volunteers: Before you quit, answer [CARDINAL] question. What will happen to those boys if you quit? Who will fight for them if we do not ? Who will give them a fair shot if we leave? And one by [CARDINAL], the volunteers decided not to quit. We went back to those neighborhoods, and we kept at it, and we registered new voters, and we set up afterschool programs, and we fought for new jobs and helped people live lives with some measure of dignity. And we sustained ourselves with those small victories. We did not set the world on fire. Some of those communities are still very poor. There are still a lot of gangs out there. But I believe that it was those small victories that helped me win the bigger victories of [DATE] as President. And I wish I could say that this perseverance came from some innate toughness in me. But the truth is, it was learned. I got it from watching the people who raised me. More specifically, I got it from watching the women who shaped my life. I grew up as the son of a single mom who struggled to put herself through school and make ends meet. She had marriages that fell apart, even went on food stamps at [CARDINAL] point to help us get by. But she did not quit. And she earned her degree and made sure that, through scholarships and hard work, my sister and I earned ours. She used to wake me up when we were living overseas--wake me up before dawn to study my English lessons. And when I'd complain, she'd just look at me and say, This is no picnic for me either, buster. And my mom ended up dedicating herself to helping women around the world access the money they needed to start their own businesses; she was an early pioneer in microfinance. And that meant, though, that she was gone a lot, and she had her own struggles trying to figure out balancing motherhood and a career. And when she was gone, my grandmother stepped up to take care of me. She only had a high school education. She got a job at a local bank. She hit the glass ceiling and watched men she once trained promoted up the ladder ahead of her. But she did not quit. Rather than grow hard or angry each time she got passed over, she kept doing her job as best as she knew how and ultimately ended up being vice president at the bank. She did not quit. And later on, I met a woman who was assigned to advise me on my first [DATE] job at a law firm. And she gave me such good advice that I married her. And [PERSON] and I gave everything we had to balance our careers and a young family. But let us face it, no matter how enlightened I must have thought myself to be, it often fell more on her shoulders when I was traveling, when I was away. I know that when she was with our girls, she'd feel guilty that she was not giving enough time to her work, and when she was at her work, she'd feel guilty she was not giving enough time to our girls. And both of us wished we had some superpower that would let us be in [CARDINAL] places at once. But we persisted. We made that marriage work. And the reason [PERSON] had the strength to juggle everything and put up with me and eventually the public spotlight was because she too came from a family of folks who did not quit. Because she saw her dad get up and go to work [DATE] even though he never finished college, even though he had crippling MS. She saw her mother, even though she never finished college, in that school, that urban school, [DATE] making sure [PERSON] and her brother were getting the education they deserved. [PERSON] saw how her parents never quit. They never indulged in self-pity, no matter how stacked the odds were against them. They did not quit. Those are the folks who inspire me. People ask me sometimes, who inspires you, Mr. [PERSON]? Those quiet heroes all across this country--some of your parents and grandparents who are sitting here--no fanfare, no articles written about them, they just persevere. They just do their jobs. They meet their responsibilities. They do not quit. I am only here because of them. They may not have set out to change the world, but in small, important ways, they did. They certainly changed mine. So whether it is starting a business or running for office or raising a amazing family, remember that making your mark on the world is hard. It takes patience. It takes commitment. It comes with plenty of setbacks, and it comes with plenty of failures. But whenever you feel that creeping cynicism, whenever you hear those voices say you cannot make a difference, whenever somebody tells you to set your sights lower, the trajectory of this country should give you hope. Previous generations should give you hope. What young generations have done before should give you hope. Young folks who marched and mobilized and stood up and sat in, from [GPE] to [GPE] to [GPE], did not just do it for themselves; they did it for other people. That is how we achieved women's rights. That is how we achieved voting rights. That is how we achieved workers' rights. That is how we achieved gay rights. That is how we have made this [GPE] more perfect. And if you are willing to do your part now, if you are willing to reach up and close that gap between what [GPE] is and what [GPE] should be, I want you to know that I will be right there with you. If you are ready to fight for that brilliant, radically simple idea of [GPE] that no matter who you are or what you look like, no matter who you love or what God you worship, you can still pursue your own happiness, I will join you every step of the way. Now more than ever, [GPE] needs what you, the class of [DATE], has to offer. [GPE] needs you to reach high and hope deeply. And if you fight for your seat at the table and you set a better example and you persevere in what you decide to do with your life, I have every faith not only that you will succeed, but that, through you, our Nation will continue to be a beacon of light for men and women, boys and girls, in every corner of the globe. So thank you. Congratulations. God bless you. God bless [GPE].", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentscommencementaddresslibertyuniversitylynchburgvirginia0", "text": "Thank you very much. everybody. And congratulations to the class of [DATE]. That is some achievement. This is [DATE] and you have earned [TIME] of it. And I am thrilled to be back at [ORG], I have been here, this is now my third time, and we love setting records, right. We always set records. We have to set records, we have no choice. It is been [DATE] since I have spoken on your beautiful campus and so much has changed. Right here, the class of [DATE] dressed in cap and gown, graduating to a totally brilliant future. And here I am standing before you as President of [GPE], so I am guessing - there are some people here [DATE] who thought that either [CARDINAL] of those things, either one, would really require major help from God. Do we agree? And we got it. But here we are celebrating together on this very joyous occasion, and there is no place in the world I'd rather be to give my first commencement address as President than here with my wonderful friends at [ORG]. And I accepted this invitation a long time ago. I said to [PERSON] that I'd be there, and when I say something I mean it. I want to thank President [PERSON] and his incredible wife, [PERSON], stand up, [PERSON], for their kind words, their steadfast support, and their really wonderful friendship. Let me also extend our appreciation to the entire [PERSON] family, [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], and [PERSON], thank you for everything you do to make this university so exceptional, [CARDINAL] of the truly great, great schools. Most importantly to our new graduates: Each of you should take immense pride in what you have achieved. There is another group of amazing people we want to celebrate [DATE] and they are the ones who have made this journey possible for you, and you know who that is? Nobody, you forgot already. You are going to go out, you are going to do whatever you are going to do, some are going to make a lot of money, some are going to be even happier doing other things - they are your parents and your grandparents, do not forget them. You have not forgotten yet, have you? Never, ever forget them, they are great. And especially [DATE], let us make sure we give a really extra special thanks to the moms. Do not forget our moms, because graduates, [DATE] is [DATE]. [DATE] is [DATE]. But in all of this excitement do not forget that [DATE] is [DATE], right? I had a great mother, she is looking down, now but I had a great mother. I always loved [DATE]. We are also deeply honored to be joined by some of the [CARDINAL] service members, military veterans and military spouses who are receiving their diplomas [DATE]. Will you please stand. Please stand. Wow. That is great. Thank you very much, great job. We are profoundly grateful to every single one of you who sacrificed to keep us safe and protect God's precious gift of freedom. It is truly a testament to this university and to the values that you embrace that your graduating class includes so many patriots who have served our country in uniform. Thank you very much. To the class of [DATE]: [DATE] you end [CARDINAL] chapter but you are about to begin the greatest adventure of your life. Just think for a moment of how blessed you are to be here [DATE] at this great, great university, living in this amazing country, surrounded by people who you love and care about so much. Then ask yourself, with all of those blessings, and all of the blessings that you have been given, what will you give back to this country and, indeed, to the world? What imprint will you leave in the sands of history? What will future [NORP] say we did in our brief time right here on Earth? Did we take risks? Did we dare to defy expectations? Did we challenge accepted wisdom and take on established systems? I think I did, but we all did and we are all doing it. Or did we just go along with convention, swim downstream, so easily with the current and just give in because it was the easy way, it was the traditional way or it was the accepted way? Remember this, nothing worth doing ever, ever, ever came easy. Following your convictions means you must be willing to face criticism from those who lack the same courage to do what is right - and they know what is right, but they do not have the courage or the guts or the stamina to take it and to do it. It is called the road less traveled. I know that each of you will be a warrior for the truth, will be a warrior for our country, and for your family. I know that each of you will do what is right, not what is the easy way, and that you will be true to yourself, and your country, and your beliefs. In my short time in [GPE] I have seen firsthand how the system is broken. A small group of failed voices who think they know everything and understand everyone want to tell everybody else how to live and what to do and how to think. But you are not going to let other people tell you what you believe, especially when you know that you are right. And those of you graduating here [DATE], who have given [TIME] of charity [DATE] alone, unbelievable amount of work and charity and few universities or colleges can claim anything even close, we do not need a lecture from [GPE] on how to lead our lives. I am standing here looking at the next generation of [NORP] leaders. There may very well be a president or [CARDINAL] in our midst. Anybody think they are going to be president, raise your hand. In your hearts are inscribed the values of service, sacrifice and devotion. Now you must go forth into the world and turn your hopes and dreams into action. [GPE] has always been the land of dreams because [GPE] is a nation of true believers. When the pilgrims landed at [GPE] they prayed. When the founders wrote the Declaration of Independence, they invoked our creator [CARDINAL] times, because in [GPE] we do not worship government we worship God. That is why our elected officials put their hands on the Bible and say, 'So help me God, ' as they take the oath of office. It is why our currency proudly declares, 'In God we trust, ' and it is why we proudly proclaim that we are [CARDINAL] nation under God every time we say the pledge of allegiance. The story of [GPE] is the story of an adventure that began with deep faith, big dreams and humble beginnings. That is also the story of [ORG]. When I think about the visionary founder of this great institution, Reverend [PERSON]., I can only imagine how excited he would be if he could see all of this and all of you [DATE], and how proud he would be of his son and of his family. In [DATE] we will mark the 10th anniversary of Reverend [PERSON]'s passing, and I used to love watching him on television, hearing him preach, he was a very special man. He would be so proud not just at what you have achieved but of the young men and women of character that you have all become. And [PERSON], I know your dad is looking down on you right now and he is proud, he is very proud, so congratulations on a great job [PERSON]. Reverend [PERSON]'s life is a testament to the power of faith to change the world. The inspiring legacy that we see all around us in this great stadium - this is a beautiful stadium and it is packed. I am so happy about that. I said, 'How are you going to fill up a place like that?' It is packed, [PERSON]. In this beautiful campus and in your smiling faces but it all began with a vision. That vision was of a world class university for evangelical [NORP]. And I want to thank you, because boy did you come out and vote, those of you that are old enough, in other words your parents. Boy oh boy, you voted, you voted. No doubt many people told him his vision was impossible, and I am sure they continued to say that so long after he started, at the beginning with just [CARDINAL] students, but the fact is no one has ever achieved anything significant without a chorus of critics standing on the sidelines explaining why it cannot be done. Nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic, because they are people that cannot get the job done. But the future belongs to the dreamers, not to the critics. the future belongs to the people who follow their heart no matter what the critics say because they truly believe in their vision. At [ORG] your leaders knew from the very beginning that a strong athletic program would help this campus grow so that this school might transform more lives. That is why a crucial part of Reverend [PERSON]'s vision for making [ORG] a world-class institution was having a world-class football team much like the great teams of [ORG], great school, great place, in fact, Vice President [PERSON] is there [DATE] doing a fabulous job as he always does. [DATE], [ORG] even wrote a story on the great ambitions of [ORG]. That story prompted a longtime president of another school to write a letter to [PERSON]. It is a letter that Reverend [PERSON] would have been very, very pleased to read. [PERSON] tells me that letter now hangs in the wall in the boardroom of your great university. It came from the late Father [PERSON], who was the beloved president of the university of [ORG] [DATE]. Like this school's founder, he was a truly kindhearted man of very, very deep faith. In the letter, Father [PERSON] recalled that [ORG] own meteoric rise from a small [NORP] school to a national football powerhouse. And then he wrote something so amazing and generous. He wrote, 'I think you are on that same trajectory now and I want to wish you all the best and encourage you from the starting and from being able to start very small and arriving in the big time.' Thanks to hard work, great faith, and incredible devotion those dreams have come true. As of [DATE], [ORG] are playing in the FBS, the highest level of competition in [ORG] football. Do not , do not clap, that could be tough. Do not clap. That could be tough. I am a little worried. I do not want to look at some of those scores here. [PERSON], you sure you know what you are doing here? Those other players are big and fast and strong but I have a feeling you are going to do very well, right? From the most humble roots you have become a powerhouse in both education and sports. And just wait until the world hears the football teams you will be playing on your schedule starting [DATE]. President [PERSON] gave me a list of some of those schools, the ones you are going to be playing [DATE]. Would you like me to read the names? Just came out, would you like to hear them? I am a little bit concerned. [ORG], [GPE], [ORG] - [PERSON], are you sure you know what you are doing? [PERSON], [ORG]? I do not know about that [PERSON]. This could be trouble, [PERSON]. [ORG], [ORG], [ORG], [ORG] - I might be at that game, who am I supposed to root for? Tell me. I do not know. That is a tough one, [PERSON]. I do not know, [PERSON], I am going to have to think about that one, [PERSON]. [GPE], [ORG], [ORG], oh no, [PERSON], [ORG] and [ORG], those are really top schools. maybe in [DATE] I will come to a game, right, you will build it up. Well good luck. The success of your athletic program arriving on the big stage should be a reminder to every new graduate of just what you can achieve when you start small, pursue a big vision and never, ever quit. You never quit. If I give you [CARDINAL] message to hold in your hearts [DATE], it is this. Never, ever give up. There will be times in your life you will want to quit, you will want to go home, you will want to go home perhaps to that wonderful mother that is sitting back there watching you and say, 'Mom, I cannot do it. I cannot do it.' Just never quit. Go back home and tell mom, dad, I can do it, I can do it. I will do it, you are going to be successful. I have seen so many brilliant people, they gave up in life, they were totally brilliant, they were top of their class, they were the best students, they were the best of everything, they gave up. I have seen others who really did not have that talent or that ability and they are among the most successful people [DATE] in the world because they never quit and they never gave up. So just remember that. Never stop fighting for what you believe in and for the people who care about you. Carry yourself with dignity and pride. Demand the best from yourself and be totally unafraid to challenge entrenched interests and failed power structures. Does that sound familiar by the way? The more people tell you it is not possible, that it cannot be done, the more you should be absolutely determined to prove them wrong. Treat the word 'impossible' as nothing more than motivation. Relish the opportunity to be an outsider. Embrace that label - being an outsider is fine, embrace the label - because it is the outsiders who change the world and who make a real and lasting difference. The more that a broken system tells you that you are wrong, the more certain you should be that you must keep pushing ahead, you must keep pushing forward. And always have the courage to be yourself. Most importantly, you have to do what you love. You have to do what you love. I have seen so many people, they are forced through lost of reasons, sometimes including family, to go down a path that they do not want to go down, to go down a path that leads them to something that they do not love, that they do not enjoy. You have to do what you love, or you most likely will not be very successful at it. So do what you love. I want to recognize a friend who is here with us [DATE], who can serve as an inspiration to us all. Someone who does not know the meaning of the word 'quit'. Real champion. A true, true champion. Both on the field, off the field, he is a [ORG] quarterback for [ORG], really a good friend of mine, an amazing guy, [PERSON], where is [PERSON], he is here some place. Where is [PERSON], stand up, [PERSON]. What a great man. [PERSON], he was tough. [PERSON] do you have any idea how much money you'd be making [DATE]? They'd hit [PERSON], it was like tackling a linebacker. They'd hit [PERSON], [CARDINAL] guy, [CARDINAL] guys that weighed [CARDINAL], and he'd just keep going down the field. He was much more than a quarterback. He had tremendous heart and he knew how to win. [PERSON] is tough, and his toughest fight of all was that he beat cancer not once but twice. And I saw him and his incredible wife as they were in a very low moment, [PERSON], very, very low moment, and it was amazing the way they fought. It did not look good, I would have said, maybe, maybe it is not going to happen. But there was always that hope because of [PERSON] and [PERSON]'s heart. But I want to just say it is great to have you here [DATE] [PERSON] and these people are big, big fans and if you can get a young version of [PERSON], you will be beating a lot of teams, [PERSON]. So, interestingly, though, I said 'I wonder what [PERSON]'s doing here, ' his daughter [PERSON] crosses the goal line to you and [DATE] with you so, [PERSON], stand up. Where are you, [PERSON]? Where is [PERSON]? Congratulations, [PERSON]. Congratulations. Graduating from [ORG]. Great choice, thank you. [ORG] is a place where they really have true champions and you have a simple creed that you live by: To be, really, champions for [PERSON]. Whether you are called to be a missionary overseas, to shepherd a church or to be a leader in your community, you are living witness of the gospel message of faith, hope and love. And I must tell you I am so proud as your president to have helped you along over the past short period of time. I said I was going to do it, and [PERSON], I did it. And a lot of people are very happy with what is taken place, especially [DATE], we did some very important signings, right [PERSON]? Very important signings. [GPE] is better when people put their faith into action. As long as I am your president, no one is ever going to stop you from practicing your faith or from preaching what is in your heart. We will always stand up for the right of all [NORP] to pray to God and to follow his teachings. [GPE] is beginning a new chapter. [DATE] each of you begins a new chapter as well. When your story goes from here, it will be defined by your vision, your perseverance and your grit. That is a word [PERSON] knows very well, your grit. In this, I am reminded of another man you know very well and who has joined us here [DATE]. His name is [PERSON], [ORG] CFO and vice president for [DATE]. During World War II, [PERSON] spent [DATE] as a prisoner of war. He saw many of his fellow soldiers die during the [NORP] death march. He was the victim of starvation and torture as a prisoner of war. When he was finally set free he weighed [QUANTITY] and was told he would not live past [DATE]. [DATE] [PERSON] is [DATE]. Great. That is so great, [PERSON]. If anyone ever had reason to quit, to give in to the bitterness and anger that we all face at some point, to lose hope in God's vision for his life, it was indeed [PERSON]. But that is not what he did. He stood up for his country, he stood up for his community. He stood up for his family and he defended civilization against a tide of barbarity, the kind of barbarity we are seeing [DATE] and we have been witnessing over [DATE] and I just want to tell you as your president, we are doing very, very well in countering it, so you just hang in there. Things are going along very, very well. You will be hearing a lot about it [DATE] from our generals Things are going along very, very well. Through it all, he kept his faith in God, even in the darkest depths of despair. Like so many others of his generation, [PERSON] came home to a nation full of optimism and pride and began to live out the [NORP] dream. He started a family, he discovered God's plan for him and pursued that vision with all his might, pouring his passion into a tiny college in a place called [GPE], [GPE]. Did you ever hear of that? [GPE]? We love, we love it. Do you like it? We like it, right? I flew over it a little while ago. It is amazing, actually. What started as a dream with a few good friends he helped shepherd into the largest [NORP] university in the world. Just look at this amazing, soaring, growing campus and I have been watching it grow because I have been a friend of [ORG] for a long time, now, [PERSON]. It is been a long time. Thanks in great part [PERSON]'s financial stewardship [CARDINAL] of young hearts and souls have been enriched at [ORG] and inspired by the spirit of God. [PERSON], we thank you, and we salute you, and you just stay healthy for a long time, [PERSON], thank you. Now it falls on the shoulders of each of you here [DATE] to protect the freedom that patriots like [PERSON] earned with their incredible sacrifice. Fortunately you have been equipped with the tools from your time right here on this campus to make the right decisions and to serve God, family and country. As you build good lives, you will also be rebuilding our nation. You will be leaders in your communities, stewards of great institutions and defenders of liberty and you will be great mothers and fathers and grandmothers and grandfathers, loving friends and loving family members. You will build a future where we have the courage to chase our dreams no matter what the cynics and the doubters have to say. You will have the confidence to speak the hopes in your hearts and to express the love that stirs your souls. And you will have the faith to replace a broken establishment with a government that serves and protects the people. We must always remember that we share [CARDINAL] home and [CARDINAL] glorious destiny whether we are brown, black or white. We all bleed the same red blood of patriots. We all salute the same great [NORP] flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God. As long as you remember what you have learned here at [ORG], as long as you have pride in your beliefs, courage in your convictions and faith in your God, then you will not fail. And as long as [GPE] remains true to its values, loyal to its citizens, and devoted to its creator, then [DATE] are yet to come, I can promise you that. This has been [TIME]. It is been a great honor for me and I want to thank you, the students. I also want to thank you, the family, for getting them there, and I want to thank and congratulate [PERSON]. May God bless the class of [DATE]. May god bless [GPE]. May God bless all of you here [DATE]. Thank you very much, thank you. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarkscampaignrallygrandjunctioncolorado", "text": "Hello, [GPE]! It is good to be back in [GPE]. Love [GPE]! It was [DATE], around this time, that I was first in [GPE]. We had a bunch of bales of hay. You remember that? Everybody was nice. Weather was a little warm. And it is great to be back. I have got a couple of people I want to acknowledge. First of all, please give [PERSON] a big round of applause for the great introduction. And I am a little sweet on [PERSON], not just because of a great introduction, but also because she is a nurse, and I just love nurses because they do such a great job [DATE]. Also, we have got [CARDINAL] of your outstanding [GPE] Senators, [PERSON], in the house. There he is. And [CARDINAL] of your former Senators, who is now doing an outstanding job looking after the natural resources of this great country of ours: Secretary of the [ORG] [PERSON]. Now, those of you who have a seat, feel free to take a seat. Those of you who do not , just remember to bend your knees because sometimes I have people drop off in the middle ofeven when I am not talking too long, just because they have been standing too long. So especially when it is warm like this. I love you back. Who was that? I do. Now, obviously, this is a smart crowd, and so I know that most of [DATE], you have been watching the Olympics, cheering on our [GPE] athletes over in [GPE]. You have been spending time with family and trying to get outdoors, at least when it cools off. But unless you have been able to hide the television completely or your cable is broke, then you may be aware there is a pretty intense campaign going on right now. And the reason it is such an intense campaign is because the choice that we face in [DATE] could not be bigger. This is not just a choice between [CARDINAL] candidates or [CARDINAL] political parties. It is a choice about [CARDINAL] fundamentally different visions for the country, [CARDINAL] fundamentally different paths. And the direction that we choose the direction that you choose when you walk into that voting booth in [DATE] is going to have a direct impact not just on our lives, but on the lives of our children and our grandchildren for [DATE] to come. Now, [DATE], we came together [NORP], but also [NORP] and some [NORP] to restore the basic bargain that had built this country, that had made us the most prosperous nation on Earth. And it is a very simple bargain. It says, if you work hard, your work will be rewarded. It says that if you put in enough effort, you can find a job that pays a decent wage, pays the bills; that you can afford to have a home that you call your own; that you have health care you can count on when you get sick; that after a lifetime of labor, you can put away enough to retire with dignity and respect; and most importantly, that you can give your kids the kind of education and opportunity that allows them to dream even bigger and do even better than you could ever imagine. That is the promise of [GPE]. [Applause] That is the promise of [GPE]. Now, when we came together, we knew restoring that bargain that deal, that compact was not going to be easy. We knew it would take [DATE] or [CARDINAL] term or maybe even [CARDINAL] President, because because we had seen what had happened in [DATE]. Jobs had moved overseas. Folks were working harder and harder, but their wages or incomes, they were staying flat, sometimes even going down. The cost of everything from health care to college was going up. And then, it all culminated in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, a crisis that robbed too many of our friends and our neighbors of jobs, the value of their homes, their savings. And all that pushed the [NORP] Dream even further out of reach for too many working people. But you know what, we have spent [DATE] digging ourselves out of that hole. We averted a depression, created [CARDINAL] new jobs, [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] in manufacturing. We saved an auto industry. We made sure that we worked to make college more affordable. We worked to make sure that health care was secure for families. And what we discovered during the course of these difficult times is that a crisis does not change our character. It does not change who we are as a people. It does not change what makes us great: our toughness, our grit, our resilience, and our ability to come together and work together on behalf of this country. And when we came together in [DATE], we understood that there is a core decency, that there is a goodness to the [NORP] people, and we need to make sure that that is reflected in what happens in [GPE]. And our mission has never been more urgent. So, after [DATE], we are still going. We are here to build an economy where hard work pays off, so that no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from, here in [GPE], you can make it if you try. That is what this campaign is about, [GPE]. And that is why I am running for a second term as President of [GPE]. Now, understand, there are no quick fixes or easy solutions to some of these challenges. But here is the thing that I constantly am reminded of wherever I travel across the country: We have the capacity to meet any challenge, because we have still got the best workers in the world. We have got the best entrepreneurs in the world. We have got the best scientists and researchers in the world and the best colleges and the best universities in the world. We are still a young nation, and we have got the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity, and people want to come here from every corner of the globe. And so no matter what the naysayers tell us, no matter how dark the other side tries to make things look, the fact is, there is not another country on Earth that would not gladly trade places with [GPE]. So we can solve our problems. What is standing in our way is not that we do not have good ideas or we do not have solutions to problems like energy independence or improving our schools. What is standing in our way is our politics. You have got a bunch of folks in [GPE] who think the only way is their way and who think that the only way to go forward is to go right back to the same policies that got us into this mess in the first place. They believe in the old top-down economics that we spent [DATE] trying and that did not work. And look, I am not exaggerating here. My opponent, Mr. [PERSON], and his friends in [ORG], when you look at their economic ideas, when you look at, you know, they have spent a lot of time on commercials, saying how there are not enough jobs and the economy is not growing fast enough. And then, you ask them, okay, well, what is it that you are thinking about doing? And you know, I am not exaggerating, it boils down to [CARDINAL] things. First of all, they want to give more tax cuts to folks at the very top. [MONEY]' worth of tax cuts on top of the [PERSON] tax cuts. And then so that is idea [CARDINAL]. Idea [CARDINAL] is let us get rid of regulations that we put into place to make sure that Wall Street does not misbehave again and we do not have another meltdown or getting rid of regulations that help protect our air and our water or getting rid of regulations that protect consumers from unscrupulous lenders. That is their basic idea. You get rid of regulations, and you cut taxes for wealthy [NORP], and somehow, jobs and prosperity will all rain down on all of us. This is the path they are proposing. If you think I am exaggerating, you go to their websites, you look at the bills that have been passed by [ORG]. That is where they will take us if they win. In fact, the centerpiece of Mr. [PERSON]'s entire economic plan is this new [MONEY] tax cut. And now I want you to pay attention here; we are going to do a little math. I know it is not everybody's favorite subject, but math is important. I like that; somebody said they love math. There you go. All right, so we have known for a while that a lot of this new [MONEY] tax cut would go to [PERCENT] of all households. But [DATE], an independent nonpartisan organization crunched the numbers. They looked, what does this mean, [MONEY]? Keep in mind, by the way, the defense budget is [MONEY]. So a [MONEY] tax cut is over [DATE] is like a tax cut that is as big as our entire defense budget [DATE]. All right? So these guys were trying to analyze what does this mean. They found that Governor [PERSON]'s plan would raise taxes on middle class families with children by an average of [MONEY]. Now, the reason is as he says that this [MONEY] tax cut he will pay for by doing other things, by slashing education or making [ORG] into a voucher. But even after he makes all the cuts to education and training and science and research and transportation and environmental protection, you name it, it turns out, he is still short. So the only way that you could actually pay for it is to have you pick up the bill. So you would then pay $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] extra every year not to reduce the deficit, not to help our kids get an education, not to rebuild our roads and our bridges or lay broadband lines into rural communities. He would ask the middle class to pay more in taxes so he could give another $[MONEY], 000 to people making [MONEY] a year. Now, he was asked about this, his campaign was asked about it, and if this sounds like an idea that would be difficult to explain to the [NORP] people, you are right. Let us just say there was a whole different kind of gymnastics being performed by Mr. [PERSON] than what is been happening in the Olympics. So they were twisting, and they were turning and doing backflips and trying to say, well, this is a biased report, despite the fact that the head of this nonpartisan center used to work for President [PERSON]. But it is not surprising that he was trying to scramble a little bit, because they have tried to sell this old, trickle-down tax cut fairy dust before. And you know what, it did not work then. It will not work [DATE]. It is not a plan to create jobs. It is not a plan to lower the deficit. It is not a plan to move our economy forward. It is not a plan to build the middle class. We do not need more tax cuts for folks like me. We need tax cuts for working [NORP] who are trying to raise a family and keep our families healthy and send our kids to college and keep a roof over their heads. That is who needs some help. That is the choice in this election, and that is why I am running for President: to fight for you. Now, you guys still bending your knees? All right. You have got some water; get hydrated. [PERSON] made me promise that I cannot sing to others anymore. Because she wants me to just sing to her, you know? But look, [GPE], I have got a different plan for [GPE]. Their ideas are not going to work. [DATE], I promised to cut middle class taxes. That is exactly what I have done. The typical family has seen their taxes go down by [MONEY]. So when you talk to your friends or neighbors and they say, he is a big, spending, tax-raising [NORP] you have got to tell them, no, actually, if you are in the middle class, your taxes have gone down. So now I want to keep taxes exactly where they are for the first $[MONEY], 000 of everybody's income. So if your family makes [CARDINAL] which, by the way, [PERCENT] of [NORP] do, [PERCENT] of small businesses do you will not see your income taxes increase by [MONEY] [DATE]. That is my plan. And by the way, I have told [ORG] I told the [NORP] in [ORG] I said, let us do it now. You guys say you do not want to see anybody's taxes go up; I do not want to see anybody who is making $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] or less see their taxes go up. Let us go ahead and sign a bill. But shockingly enough they have not agreed so far, because they are holding you guys hostage to try to get tax cuts for [PERCENT]. Now, look, if you are fortunate enough to be in the other [PERCENT] of [NORP], you are still going to get a tax cut on the first $[MONEY], 000 of your income. So if you make [CARDINAL], the first [CARDINAL], you are still keeping all that tax cut. It is just that little bit over [CARDINAL]. Now, if you are making [MONEY], you can afford it. Right? All we are asking for folks who have been blessed like me I mean, I am not being self-interested here. It is not like I love paying taxes, but I understand I have got certain obligations because this country has been so good to me. So what I have all we are saying is for folks in [PERCENT], let us go back to what we were paying under [PERSON]. Let us contribute a little bit more so we pay down our deficit and we can still invest in things like education that help our kids succeed. Now, keep in mind, just in case you are talking to your friends or neighbors again and they say, well, that just a little bit of tax increase on the top 2 percent, that will not cut the deficit, they are right. We have got to do more. So we have already cut [MONEY]. Federal spending is growing at a slower rate than any time since [PERSON]. I will make sure Government continues to do its part, and we will cut out spending we do not need. But I am not going to pay for a massive new tax cut for millionaires and billionaires by gutting investments that have always made us strong as a country. And by the way, just like we tested their plan under the previous administration and it did not work, we have tested my plan because, as you will recall, under [PERSON], when those taxes were a little bit higher on folks like me, the economy grew faster than it has in [DATE], [CARDINAL] new jobs. We went from a deficit to a surplus. And folks at the top did well. We created a lot of millionaires to boot. And the reason is that, look, when a construction worker has a got a little money in his pocket, now he starts thinking about buying a new car. When a teacher has security in her job, now she might go to a restaurant once in a while. And so what happens is, when the middle class is strong, suddenly, businesses have more customers, businesses have more profits, businesses decide to hire more workers. Everybody does well. That is how we build a strong economy, not from the top down, from the middle out, from the bottom up. That is the choice in this election. That is why I am running for a second term for President of [GPE]. Now, let me say, you can see how this plays out on a whole bunch of issues, not just taxes and the deficit. When the [NORP] auto industry was on the brink of collapse, [CARDINAL] jobs at stake, Governor [PERSON] says, let us let [GPE] go bankrupt. I said let us bet on [NORP] workers. And the [NORP] auto industry has come roaring back. So now I want to make sure that the jobs of [DATE], including advanced manufacturing jobs, that they are not taking root in [GPE] or [GPE]. I want them to take root in [GPE], in [GPE], in [GPE]. Governor [PERSON] and I have a different theory. He spent his private sector experience investing in companies that were called pioneers of outsourcing. I want to insource. I want to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Let us give those tax breaks to companies that are investing in [GPE], investing in [GPE], hiring [NORP] workers, selling [NORP] products, stamping those goods with [CARDINAL] proud words: Made in [GPE]. That is what I believe. Mr. [PERSON] says it was tragic for me to end the war in [GPE], like I promised. I think after [DATE] of war, it is time to do some nation-building here at home. Thanks to the incredible service of our men and women in uniform, [GPE] is in charge of its own destiny. We are bringing troops home from [GPE]. We went after [PERSON] and [ORG], and we got them. So now let us take [CARDINAL] of the savings that we were spending on war, and let us use it to put people back to work rebuilding schools, rebuilding bridges, rebuilding roads, improving our airport systems, improving our ports so that we can move goods and services that will make our economy strong not just now, but in the future. And by the way, that also helps us pay for providing services that our men and women in uniform have earned. Our veterans fought too hard for us for them to have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads when they come home. That is a sacred trust we have got to keep. I am running to make sure [GPE] once again leads the world in educating our kids. I want to hire new teachers, especially in math and science. Help [CARDINAL] people go to community colleges to train for the jobs that businesses are hiring for right now. And I want to make sure that every young person can afford to go to college. We have already expanded student aid; now we need to bring tuitions down. That is why I am running for President: to give our young people a chance. On every issue, there is a difference. On housing and foreclosures, Mr. [PERSON] says let the market just bottom out. I say let us let every [NORP] refinance their homes at historically low rates, save $[MONEY], [MONEY] per family, per homeowner. That could actually boost the economy and strengthen the housing market. When it comes to health care, he wants to kill [ORG]. I am implementing Obamacare because it was the right thing to do. Already, as we speak, [CARDINAL] young people [DATE] can stay on their parent's plan. [CARDINAL] of seniors have saved [MONEY] on their prescription drugs, and we are closing the doughnut hole. Individuals and businesses are getting rebates from their insurance companies because insurance companies have to use most of the money they get in premiums to provide care, not for CEO bonuses and administrative costs. If your child has a preexisting condition, insurance companies cannot turn them down. Soon, adults who have preexisting conditions cannot be turned down. So if that is what Mr. [PERSON] wants to get rid of, despite the fact that he did the same thing in [GPE] and it worked pretty well then that is a different that is a choice in this election. You know, I do not think we should be refighting some of the battles he wants to refight. I think it was the right thing to do to end do not ask, do not tell. I think you should be able to serve your country no matter who you are. I do not think it makes sense for us to take away control that women have over their own health care decisions. But most of all, most of all, I want to make sure that that original bargain that made this country great, that basic idea that if you work hard you can make it, that that is restored. And everything we do from health care to education, to manufacturing, to our infrastructure, to our investment in science and research all of this is designed to make sure that we have got a strong middle class going forward, that no matter what you look like, where you come from, that everybody has got a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules. That is the same promise our parents and our grandparents and our great-grandparents believed in. And now we have got to pass on that same promise to the next generation. Now, over [DATE] [DATE], to be precise the other side will be spending more money than we have ever seen. You have got these guys writing [MONEY] checks. You have got these super PACs that are just going crazy. And now, here is the thing. I do not know why they are running all these ads, because basically, they only have [CARDINAL] ad. It is just a variation on the same ad, which is, the economy is not where it should be and it is [[PERSON]]'s fault. That is their basic argument. Because they know they cannot sell their actual plans; they do not have plans. Their message is designed to try to win an election, but it is not a plan to create jobs. They do not have a plan to grow the economy. They do not have a plan to revive the middle class. But I do. And so when you are talking to your friends and your neighbors, and they say, well, I do not know, Mr. [PERSON], he ran a business and I think maybe that might work, look, if you believe that trying what we already tried and it did not work is worth trying again, if you believe it is okay to cut taxes for folks who are doing really well and ask folks who are struggling to do more, if you think it is okay for us to cut back on our investments in education and science and set our sights lower, then their that is your choice. That is how our democracy works. Try it out. But you know what, if you believe that we are on the right track if you think like I do that we have come too far to turn back now then I am going to need you, [GPE]. We have got too many good jobs to create. We have got too many good teachers to hire. We have got too many great schools to build. We have got too many students we need to help go to college. We have got too much homegrown clean energy to generate. We have got more troops to bring home. We have got more doors of opportunity to open to everybody who is willing to work hard, to walk through that door. We have got to leave something behind for the next generation so they can do even better, so they can do even bigger than we ever imagined. That is what is at stake. That is why I am running. And if you are willing to stand with me and if you still believe in me just like I believe in you, we will win, [GPE]. We will win this election. We will finish what we started. And we will remind the world why [GPE] is the greatest nation on Earth. God bless you. God bless [GPE].", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressthenationiraqfromcincinnatiohio", "text": "Thank you all. Thank you for that very gracious and warm [GPE] welcome. I am honored to be here [TIME]. I appreciate you all coming. [TIME] I want to take [TIME] to discuss a grave threat to peace and [GPE]'s determination to lead the world in confronting that threat. The threat comes from [GPE]. It arises directly from the [NORP] regime's own actions-its history of aggression and its drive toward an arsenal of terror. [DATE], as a condition for ending the Persian Gulf war, the [NORP] regime was required to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, to cease all development of such weapons, and to stop all support for terrorist groups. The [NORP] regime has violated all of those obligations. It possesses and produces chemical and biological weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons. It has given shelter and support to terrorism and practices terror against its own people. The entire world has witnessed [GPE]'s [DATE] history of defiance, deception, and bad faith. We must also never forget the most vivid events of recent history. On [DATE], [GPE] felt its vulnerability, even to threats that gather on the other side of the Earth. We resolved then and we are resolved [DATE] to confront every threat, from any source, that could bring sudden terror and suffering to [GPE]. Members of [ORG] of both political parties and members of [ORG] agree that [PERSON] is a threat to peace and must disarm. We agree that the [NORP] dictator must not be permitted to threaten [GPE] and the world with horrible poisons and diseases and gases and atomic weapons. Since we all agree on this goal, the issue is: How can we best achieve it? Many [NORP] have raised legitimate questions about the nature of the threat, about the urgency of action-why be concerned now-about the link between [GPE] developing weapons of terror and the wider war on terror. These are all issues we have discussed broadly and fully within my administration. And [TIME] I want to share those discussions with you. First, some ask why [GPE] is different from other countries or regimes that also have terrible weapons. While there are many dangers in the world, the threat from [GPE] stands alone because it gathers the most serious dangers of our age in one place. [GPE]'s weapons of mass destruction are controlled by a murderous tyrant who has already used chemical weapons to kill [CARDINAL] of people. This same tyrant has tried to dominate the Middle East, has invaded and brutally occupied a small neighbor, has struck other nations without warning, and holds an unrelenting hostility toward [GPE]. By its past and present actions, by its technological capabilities, by the merciless nature of its regime, [GPE] is unique. As a former chief weapons inspector of the [ORG] has said, The fundamental problem with [GPE] remains the nature of the regime, itself. [PERSON] is a homicidal dictator who is addicted to weapons of mass destruction. Some ask how urgent this danger is to [GPE] and the world. The danger is already significant, and it only grows worse with time. If we know [PERSON] has dangerous weapons [DATE]-and we do-does it make any sense for the world to wait to confront him as he grows even stronger and develops even more dangerous weapons? In [DATE], after [DATE] of deceit by the [NORP] regime, the head of [GPE]'s military industries defected. It was then that the regime was forced to admit that it had produced [QUANTITY] of anthrax and other deadly biological agents. The inspectors, however, concluded that [GPE] had likely produced [CARDINAL] times that amount. This is a massive stockpile of biological weapons that has never been accounted for and is capable of killing [CARDINAL]. We know that the regime has produced [CARDINAL] of tons of chemical agents, including mustard gas, sarin nerve gas, VX nerve gas. [PERSON] also has experience in using chemical weapons. He has ordered chemical attacks on [GPE] and on [CARDINAL] villages in his own country. These actions killed or injured [CARDINAL] 000 people, [CARDINAL] times the number of people who died in the attacks of [DATE]. And surveillance photos reveal that the regime is rebuilding facilities that it had used to produce chemical and biological weapons. Every chemical and biological weapon that [GPE] has or makes is a direct violation of the truce that ended the Persian Gulf war in [DATE]. Yet, [PERSON] has chosen to build and keep these weapons despite international sanctions, [ORG] demands, and isolation from the civilized world. [GPE] possesses ballistic missiles with a likely range of [QUANTITY]-far enough to strike [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and other nations-in a region where [CARDINAL] [NORP] civilians and service members live and work. We have also discovered through intelligence that [GPE] has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that could be used to disperse chemical or biological weapons across broad areas. We are concerned that [GPE] is exploring ways of using these UAVs for missions targeting [GPE]. And of course, sophisticated delivery systems are not required for a chemical or biological attack; all that might be required are a small container and [CARDINAL] terrorist or [NORP] intelligence operative to deliver it. And that is the source of our urgent concern about [PERSON] links to international terrorist groups. Over [DATE], [GPE] has provided safe haven to terrorists such as [PERSON], whose terror organization carried out [CARDINAL] terrorist attacks in [CARDINAL] countries that killed or injured [CARDINAL] people, including [CARDINAL] [NORP]. [GPE] has also provided safe haven to [PERSON], who was responsible for seizing the Achille Lauro and killing an [NORP] passenger. And we know that [GPE] is continuing to finance terror and gives assistance to groups that use terrorism to undermine Middle East peace. We know that [GPE] and the [ORG] terrorist network share a common enemy- [GPE]. We know that [GPE] and [ORG] have had high-level contacts that go back [DATE]. Some [ORG] leaders who fled [GPE] went to [GPE]. These include [CARDINAL] very senior [ORG] leader who received medical treatment in [GPE] [DATE], and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks. We have learned that [GPE] has trained [ORG] members in bombmaking and poisons and deadly gases. And we know that after [DATE], [PERSON] regime gleefully celebrated the terrorist attacks on [GPE]. [GPE] could decide on [DATE] to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists. Alliance with terrorists could allow the [NORP] regime to attack [GPE] without leaving any fingerprints. Some have argued that confronting the threat from [GPE] could detract from the war against terror. To the contrary, confronting the threat posed by [GPE] is crucial to winning the war on terror. When I spoke to [ORG] [DATE], I said that those who harbor terrorists are as guilty as the terrorists themselves. [PERSON] is harboring terrorists and the instruments of terror, the instruments of mass death and destruction. And he cannot be trusted. The risk is simply too great that he will use them or provide them to a terror network. Terror cells and outlaw regimes building weapons of mass destruction are different faces of the same evil. Our security requires that we confront both, and the [GPE] military is capable of confronting both. Many people have asked how close [PERSON] is to developing a nuclear weapon. Well, we do not know exactly, and that is the problem. Before the Gulf war, the best intelligence indicated that [GPE] was [DATE] away from developing a nuclear weapon. After the war, international inspectors learned that the regime had been much closer-the regime in [GPE] would likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later than [DATE]. The inspectors discovered that [GPE] had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a workable nuclear weapon, and was pursuing several different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb. Before being barred from [GPE] in [DATE], [ORG] dismantled extensive nuclear weapons-related facilities, including [CARDINAL] uranium enrichment sites. [DATE], information from a high-ranking [NORP] nuclear engineer who had defected revealed that despite his public promises, [PERSON] had ordered his nuclear program to continue. The evidence indicates that [GPE] is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program. [PERSON] has held numerous meetings with [NORP] nuclear scientists, a group he calls his nuclear mujahideen, his nuclear holy warriors. Satellite photographs reveal that [GPE] is rebuilding facilities at sites that have been part of its nuclear program in the past. [GPE] has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes and other equipment needed for gas centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. If the [NORP] regime is able to produce, buy, or steal an amount of highly enriched uranium a little larger than a single softball, it could have a nuclear weapon in [DATE]. And if we allow that to happen, a terrible line would be crossed. [PERSON] would be in a position to blackmail anyone who opposes his aggression. He would be in a position to dominate the Middle East. He would be in a position to threaten [GPE]. And [PERSON] would be in a position to pass nuclear technology to terrorists. Some citizens wonder, after [DATE] of living with this problem, why do we need to confront it now? And there is a reason. We have experienced the horror of [DATE]. We have seen that those who hate [GPE] are willing to crash airplanes into buildings full of innocent people. Our enemies would be no less willing-in fact, they would be eager-to use biological or chemical or a nuclear weapon. Knowing these realities, [GPE] must not ignore the threat gathering against us. Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking gun, that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud. As President [PERSON] said in [DATE], Neither [GPE] nor the world community of nations can tolerate deliberate deception and offensive threats on the part of any nation, large or small. We no longer live in a world, he said, where only the actual firing of weapons represents a sufficient challenge to a nation's security to constitute maximum peril. Understanding the threats of our time, knowing the designs and deceptions of the [NORP] regime, we have every reason to assume the worst, and we have an urgent duty to prevent the worst from occurring. Some believe we can address this danger by simply resuming the old approach to inspections and applying diplomatic and economic pressure. Yet this is precisely what the world has tried to do since [DATE]. The [ORG] inspections program was met with systematic deception. The [NORP] regime bugged hotel rooms and offices of inspectors to find where they were going next. They forged documents, destroyed evidence, and developed mobile weapons facilities to keep a step ahead of inspectors. [CARDINAL] so-called Presidential palaces were declared off-limits to unfettered inspections. These sites actually encompass [QUANTITY], with [CARDINAL] of structures, both above and below the ground, where sensitive materials could be hidden. The world has also tried economic sanctions and watched [GPE] use [MONEY] in illegal oil revenues to fund more weapons purchases, rather than providing for the needs of the [NORP] people. The world has tried limited military strikes to destroy [GPE]'s weapons of mass destruction capabilities, only to see them openly rebuilt, while the regime again denies they even exist. The world has tried no-fly zones to keep [PERSON] from terrorizing his own people, and in [DATE], the [NORP] military has fired upon [NORP] and [NORP] pilots [CARDINAL] times. After [DATE] during which we have tried containment, sanctions, inspections, even selected military action, the end result is that [PERSON] still has chemical and biological weapons and is increasing his capabilities to make more. And he is moving ever closer to developing a nuclear weapon. Clearly, to actually work, any new inspections, sanctions, or enforcement mechanisms will have to be very different. [GPE] wants the [ORG] to be an effective organization that helps keep the peace. And that is why we are urging [ORG] to adopt a new resolution setting out tough, immediate requirements. Among those requirements, the [NORP] regime must reveal and destroy, under [ORG] supervision, all existing weapons of mass destruction. To ensure that we learn the truth, the regime must allow witnesses to its illegal activities to be interviewed outside the country, and these witnesses must be free to bring their families with them so they are all beyond the reach of [PERSON] terror and murder. And inspectors must have access to any site, at any time, without preclearance, without delay, without exceptions. The time for denying, deceiving, and delaying has come to an end. [PERSON] must disarm himself, or for the sake of peace, we will lead a coalition to disarm him. Many nations are joining us in insisting that [PERSON] regime be held accountable. They are committed to defending the international security that protects the lives of both our citizens and theirs. And that is why [GPE] is challenging all nations to take the resolutions of [ORG] seriously. And these resolutions are very clear. In addition to declaring and destroying all of its weapons of mass destruction, [GPE] must end its support for terrorism. It must cease the persecution of its civilian population. It must stop all illicit trade outside the oilfor-food program. It must release or account for all Gulf war personnel, including an [NORP] pilot whose fate is still unknown. By taking these steps and by only taking these steps, the [NORP] regime has an opportunity to avoid conflict. Taking these steps would also change the nature of the [NORP] regime, itself. [GPE] hopes the regime will make that choice. Unfortunately, at least so far, we have little reason to expect it. And that is why [CARDINAL] administrations, mine and President [PERSON]'s, have stated that regime change in [GPE] is the only certain means of removing a great danger to our Nation. I hope this will not require military action, but it may. And military conflict could be difficult. An [NORP] regime faced with its own demise may attempt cruel and desperate measures. If [PERSON] orders such measures, his generals would be well advised to refuse those orders. If they do not refuse, they must understand that all war criminals will be pursued and punished. If we have to act, we will take every precaution that is possible. We will plan carefully. We will act with the full power of the [GPE] military. We will act with allies at our side, and we will prevail. There is no easy or risk-free course of action. Some have argued we should wait, and that is an option. In my view, it is the riskiest of all options, because the longer we wait, the stronger and bolder [PERSON] will become. We could wait and hope that [PERSON] does not give weapons to terrorists or develop a nuclear weapon to blackmail the world. But I am convinced that is a hope against all evidence. As [NORP], we want peace; we work and sacrifice for peace. But there can be no peace if our security depends on the will and whims of a ruthless and aggressive dictator. I am not willing to stake [CARDINAL] [NORP] life on trusting [PERSON]. Failure to act would embolden other tyrants, allow terrorists access to new weapons and new resources, and make blackmail a permanent feature of world events. [ORG] would betray the purpose of its founding and prove irrelevant to the problems of our time. And through its inaction, [GPE] would resign itself to a future of fear. That is not the [GPE] I know. That is not the [GPE] I serve. We refuse to live in fear. This [ORG], in World War and in cold war, has never permitted the brutal and lawless to set history's course. Now as before, we will secure our [ORG], protect our freedom, and help others to find freedom of their own. Some worry that a change of leadership in [GPE] could create instability and make the situation worse. The situation could hardly get worse for world security and for the people of [GPE]. The lives of [NORP] citizens would improve dramatically if [PERSON] were no longer in power, just as the lives of [GPE]'s citizens improved after the [ORG]. The dictator of [GPE] is a student of [PERSON], using murder as a tool of terror and control, within his own cabinet, within his own army, and even within his own family. On [PERSON] orders, opponents have been decapitated, wives and mothers of political opponents have been systematically raped as a method of intimidation, and political prisoners have been forced to watch their own children being tortured. [GPE] believes that all people are entitled to hope and human rights, to the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity. People everywhere prefer freedom to slavery, prosperity to squalor, self-government to the rule of terror and torture. [GPE] is a friend to the people of [GPE]. Our demands are directed only at the regime that enslaves them and threatens us. When these demands are met, the first and greatest benefit will come to [NORP] men, women, and children. The oppression of [NORP], [NORP], [NORP], [NORP], [NORP], and others will be lifted. The long captivity of [GPE] will end, and an era of new hope will begin. [GPE] is a land rich in culture and resources and talent. Freed from the weight of oppression, [GPE]'s people will be able to share in the progress and prosperity of our time. If military action is necessary, [GPE] and our allies will help the [NORP] people rebuild their economy and create the institutions of liberty in a unified [GPE] at peace with its neighbors. [DATE], [ORG] [ORG] will vote on this matter. I have asked [ORG] to authorize the use of [GPE]'s military, if it proves necessary, to enforce [ORG] demands. Approving this resolution does not mean that military action is imminent or unavoidable. The resolution will tell [ORG] and all nations that [GPE] speaks with one voice and is determined to make the demands of the civilized world mean something. [ORG] will also be sending a message to the dictator in [GPE] that his only chance-his only choice is full compliance, and the time remaining for that choice is limited. Members of [ORG] are nearing an historic vote. I am confident they will fully consider the facts and their duties. The attacks of [DATE] showed our country that vast oceans no longer protect us from danger. Before that tragic date, we had only hints of [ORG] plans and designs. [DATE] in [GPE], we see a threat whose outlines are far more clearly defined and whose consequences could be far more deadly. [PERSON] actions have put us on notice, and there is no refuge from our responsibilities. We did not ask for this present challenge, but we accept it. Like other generations of [NORP], we will meet the responsibility of defending human liberty against violence and aggression. By our resolve, we will give strength to others. By our courage, we will give hope to others. And by our actions, we will secure the peace and lead the world to a better day. May God bless [GPE].", "discourse_type": 0}

Do not live very far away as you know. The lighthouse, it is , my home state is called the state of [GPE] and it is a great state. Hello [PERSON]. Sit down. Do you have seats? Yeah, you do sit down everybody. The sunshine state is truly one of the most beautiful places on earth. I love it. And together we will preserve its breathtaking natural splendor for [DATE] to come. We are here [DATE] to celebrate our incredible record of natural conservation and environmental protection. Over [DATE] I have been working with your both governors, your last governors, your current governor is fantastic by the way and we have been working very, very hard. We have been working very hard together to make sure everything is perfect and to recommit ourselves to preserving the awesome majesty of God's great creation. Joining us in the wonderful support effort of that mission is secretary of the interior, a man who is worked so hard in this, [PERSON]. Thank you very much, [PERSON]. Thank you. And [ORG] administrator, very powerful, man. When he says you can do it, you do it when he says you cannot it is over with, you do not have a chance, [PERSON]. Thank you, [PERSON]. Thank you. Great job. And of course your governor [PERSON], who is run, not only did he run a great campaign, he is a great governor. Thanks [PERSON]. What a great job. What a great job he did. Of course we will let you know on [DATE], I will let you know if he did a good job, okay? Also, I want to introduce Lieutenant Governor, [PERSON] who is been such a fantastic friend and supporter. Thank you very much, [PERSON]. And [CARDINAL] of the great attorney generals, anywhere in the country, [PERSON]. [PERSON], thank you. Thank you very much. [GPE] CFO, [PERSON]. [PERSON], thank you, [PERSON], great job. A man who everybody loves, he is highly respected in [GPE], he is a great Senator, [PERSON], [GPE]. Thank you, [PERSON]. Great job. Representatives [PERSON], where is [PERSON]? [PERSON], how are you, [PERSON]? Thank you very much. Great job you are doing. We have a lot of good ones here. We have warriors. I call them my warriors, that is what they are, and [PERSON], the job you have done and [PERSON], Where is [PERSON]? Where is [PERSON]? Where is [PERSON]? That is not a very good location for you, [PERSON], I am used to having you sitting right up here. What is going on? That is good. [PERSON], [PERSON]. [PERSON], fantastic guy. Thank you, [PERSON]. They are our warriors. You see what they do. They have to fight [PERSON], [PERSON], they have to fight all these characters and they do very well in the fights. We want them on our site, [PERSON], [PERSON], thank you very much. Great job. Great job [TIME], I watched. [PERSON]. [PERSON]? [PERSON], thank you, [PERSON]. [PERSON]. [PERSON], fantastic, [PERSON]. And [PERSON], They have actually become my friends, actually. [PERSON], thank you very much. Great, great. Where is [PERSON]? Great [PERSON], thank you very much. Great job. And from [GPE], state representative [PERSON], who is got a very important race where I think you are doing very well. I think you are doing very well from what I hear, right? You got to win that one. That is an important one. We are behind you [PERCENT]. You know that right? As well as mayor of [GPE], [PERSON], where is [PERSON]? [PERSON], great. I want to thank you all for being here. My administration's proving [DATE] that we can improve our environment while creating [CARDINAL] of high paying jobs. This is a really sharp contrast to the extreme, radical left that you have had to deal with and what you are doing right now is a lot better than anything you have ever been accustomed to, I will tell you that. [PERSON] plan would destroy [GPE]'s middle class while giving a free pass to the world's worst foreign polluters like [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and many others. They do not have to clean up their lands, but we have to clean up ours. The left's agenda is not about protecting the environment, it is about punishing [GPE] and that is true. Instead of focusing on radical ideology, my administration is focused on delivering real results and that is what we have and we right now have the cleanest air we have ever had in this country. Let us say over [DATE], because I assume [DATE] was probably better. What do you think? I would say that. What do you think the fellas? So I do want to preface that because the fake news is back there. When I say the cleanest air we have ever had over a [DATE] period, [PERSON], is that okay? [DATE], I would imagine it was pretty good, right? To safeguard our stunning coastal areas, I signed legislation authorizing [MONEY] to fight the red tide and toxic algae and to preserve the Everglades and defend [GPE] from catastrophic flooding. You know about the flooding. We spent a lot of money on flooding and a lot of money on hurricanes and when your governors came to me and they said, Can we have this? Can we have that? We need some more for the Panhandle, they said, We have to help the panhandle. I said, Without question and without any wait, let us go. Right? That is what we said. You have never had it so easy in your life. He'd walk into my office, say, Sir, [CARDINAL] more. How much is it going to cost? How about [CARDINAL]? Yeah, my staff was not too thrilled. We had to override the staff a couple of times. We have directed [MONEY] to fix [FAC] and Lake Okeechobee, Lake Okeechobee. We fixed it up good, Mr. [PERSON], we did a good job. Did a good job. We will now compete with this project and we are way ahead, we are way ahead, [DATE], I think, ahead of schedule from what the original time of completion was going to be and I am in particular happy with what we have done on Lake Okeechobee. I know it well, I know it well. Everyone said that one could not be done, [PERSON], you know that right? They said it would never happen. You will never get it funded. It is a big deal and it is all gotten done, including the tide is gone, will be gone, finally from all of the problems that they have had with it. We have expanded funding for the Everglades restoration by [PERCENT] compared to [DATE] and I also want to thank [ORG] for their vital work on [FAC] and the help, they are unbelievable. [CARDINAL] thing, when they build it, I said, You know you could do it a little bit less expensive than that. The walls do not have to be [QUANTITY] thick. They could be [QUANTITY] thick, but you know when [ORG] do it, they do it right. That is [CARDINAL] thing I can tell you. We are building the wall, the wall along [GPE], between [GPE] and [GPE]. We are [QUANTITY] now of wall and that is a serious wall. That is a wall that is meant to last and meant to work, but that'll help revitalize the wetlands in the St. Lucie River estuary and the Indian River lagoon. Whoa, that is pretty good. We hit home with that one, huh? But [DATE] I have a very important announcement. I do not know if it is bigger than the things we just announced or the things that we have already done or we are in the process of completing. In [TIME] I will sign a presidential order extending the moratorium on offshore drilling on [GPE]'s Gulf Coast and expanding it to [GPE]'s Atlantic coast, as well as the coasts of [GPE] and [GPE]. thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. I guess you like that one the best of all. This action follows close consultation with [GPE] Governor [PERSON], he is been unbelievable, [GPE] Senators [PERSON], and [PERSON], they have worked so hard, as well as [GPE] Senator [PERSON] and [PERSON]. [PERSON], thank you. [PERSON] liked the idea right from the beginning. I said, What do you think? It took you, how long? [TIME] to say I like it. The Governor of [GPE], a great man and a really great governor, [PERSON] and I also want to thank the governor of [GPE], [PERSON], he is doing a fantastic job and a Senator who from [DATE], he is been with me, Senator [PERSON], [GPE], and Senator [PERSON] and Congressman [PERSON] and [GPE] State Representative [PERSON]. Again, I want to thank you all, incredible. Thanks to my administration's [NORP] energy policies we can take this step and the next step while remaining the number [CARDINAL] producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, we are the largest producer now in the world by far. We are number [CARDINAL] in the world and we are energy independent, which is a nice With fracking, the shale revolution and the tremendous surge in [NORP] energy production, we are showing that we can create jobs, safeguard the environment and keep energy prices low for [GPE] and low for our citizens and you see that, you also see it when you pump the gas into your car and you are paying sometimes a lot less than $2.00 Lately, right? So we are doing well and we have so much of it. I do not know, we got more than everybody, anybody ever thought possible, right? That is really incredible what is happened. The approach of [PERSON] and the radical left is exactly the opposite. Their policies will destroy jobs, cause energy prices to double and triple and quadruple, to skyrocket beyond belief and the environment will be badly hurt. If you go by that, badly, badly hurt, it will be injured and permanently injured. And very importantly, they will take away our energy independence and they will do it quickly and they will not even know what happened to them. We are dealing with some smart customers. They know exactly what to do, and they do not like it when we are energy independent. They do not like it at all. So it is been a really amazing thing for [GPE] from the environmental standpoint, and I have to tell you, from the energy standpoint and from a very important level of cost. You are at a level of cost now with your electric and with so many other things caused and created by energy and fuel, the likes of which you have not seen in [DATE]. As president I will defend our environment, I will defend our workers and our cherished way of life. [DATE] I signed the great American outdoors act, the most significant investment in our national parks in [DATE], since [PERSON]. [PERSON]. You know, they came to my office, a lot of the senators that I just introduced and [PERSON] and everybody, they came to my office they said that, This will make us and make you the number [CARDINAL] environmental president since [PERSON]. I said, Huh, that sounds good. Because I was not going to do it. I figured, you know, let us not do it. But when they said that, that was like a challenge. So I said, Well, why does it only have to go back to [PERSON], which is [DATE]? Why cannot we say from [PERSON]? Right from the beginning? They said, Well, we are not quite there yet, but [CARDINAL] other bill like this we will be there, [PERSON], you know that right? But it is true, number [CARDINAL], since [PERSON], who would've thought, [SPEAKER] is the great environmentalist. You hear that, [PERSON]? You hear that? That is good. And I am. I am. I believe strongly in it. Through this legislation, we are providing [MONEY] for long delayed maintenance projects in our national parks and [GPE] has helped as much as anybody and maybe more. My administration has fully or partially cleaned up [CARDINAL] [ORG] superfund pollution sites that were rotting all over our country. Far more than [PERSON] and [PERSON]. No matter how far you go back, more than any administration. Since my inauguration we have recovered more endangered or threatened species than any other administration has accomplished in its first term. [DATE], I announced that [GPE] would joined the [CARDINAL] trees initiative. We already have [CARDINAL] trees pledged to be planted and it is moving very rapidly. We have opened land- As the last administration pursued its globalist agenda abroad, they were all over the place. They were everywhere but here, in our country. They were taking care of other lands, countries that you never heard of, they were taking care of and they did not do a good job there either. They neglected the fundamentals of public health right here in [GPE], right here in our home. My administration is focused on ensuring crystal clean air and water. Under my administration we have seen a significant drop in air pollution since [DATE], a very significant drop for the first time in [DATE]. We are strengthening standards to prevent vulnerable children from being exposed to lead and copper in drinking water, including in our schools. They were exposed to lead and copper in drinking water. We have done some job with that, that was an important one. And we have invested [MONEY] in drinking water infrastructure to care for our children. I am committed to ensuring [GPE] has the cleanest air and cleanest water on earth. The contrast between our vision and the radical left has never been more clear. They talk a big game and they do nothing. That is really what it is, too. They talk and talk the environment, they talk and talk, nothing happens. It is all talk. It is all words and no action. You ever hear that? To our political opponents, environmental policy is just an excuse to advance a socialist platform that will impose [MONEY] in new taxes and send our jobs overseas, making it impossible to open up new companies and to live less expensively. Your energy costs would be [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL], sometimes even under scenarios, [CARDINAL] times more expensive. And, really, you would not even have energy. To my administration, environmental protection is a sacred obligation and so it is our duty to fight for the dreams and livelihoods of the citizens we serve and to the citizens of [GPE] that I know so well and that I love, this is my home. This is my home. We are rapidly restoring the greatest economy in history. We created the greatest economy in the history of our country, and then we had to close it up when the [GPE] plague came in, we closed it up. We saved [CARDINAL] of lives. We banned highly infected [GPE] from coming in, it was highly infected. The people were highly infected. [GPE], we banned them. Nobody said do it, everybody said I should not do it. [PERSON] said, Do not do it, [DATE] he admitted I was right. But we banned people, we would have lost [CARDINAL] more, but we would have lost [CARDINAL] if we did not close it up and now we open it up and we are setting records at every single level. So we are maintaining that pristine resource of beautiful, clean environment at every single community in [GPE] and all over the country. We will always defend the Everglades and we will always safeguard the magnificent [GPE] coastline. We will expand access for fishermen and sportsmen, we will uphold your right to hunt and we will protect your right to keep and bear arms, your second amendment. And I can tell you this, if [PERSON] gets in, he will have nothing to say about it. He is not, let us face it. [PERSON] shot. If [PERSON] gets in, your second amendment is gone. It is gone, either obliterated to a point of being gone or gone itself, okay? You will not have a second amendment. And the pressure put on me in [DATE] to make massive changes to the second amendment, which would have really rendered it worthless, [PERSON] knows, [PERSON] knows. The pressure put on me, very few people would have been able to withstand that pressure. They would have made big, big cuts and big changes. Your second amendment will remain powerful, will remain strong, will remain with you. We will reassure our critical supply chains and we will bring back jobs in factories from [GPE] and other foreign polluters and everything we do will be guided by our love of this state, its people and its priceless natural treasures. It is a great state. From its breathtaking beaches to its shimmering bays, from its vast marshes, all those beautiful marshes, marshlands, to its wild forests, there is truly no place on earth like the great state of [GPE]. I can tell you, I am so happy to have helped because when I was first elected, you had things that were in such bad shape and now they are fixed or being fixed at a cost of a lot of money, but they are either fixed or being fixed and soon there'll be in better condition than they were [DATE] they were built, which was [DATE]. We have things that were built a long time ago that were in a state of disrepair that you would not believe. As long as I am president of [GPE], we will conserve this wondrous national inheritance from Key West to Key Biscayne, from [GPE] to [GPE], from the [GPE], beautiful [GPE], I love [GPE]. I think it was [PERCENT], that is one of the reasons I like it. They say, How'd you do in [GPE]? I said, Was that maybe [DATE]? [CARDINAL]? Right up there, so that helps. It is amazing how that can help, is not it? Right here to Jupiter, which I know very well, we will preserve this glorious land for our children, for our grandchildren and for every generation of [NORP] to come. And I will now sign this order. It is an order that does so much for the state of [GPE]. It is an order that I am so proud to sign. I have been talking about this with [PERSON] and with all of the people I have mentioned for a long time and I said, we want to get it done and this protects your beautiful Gulf and your beautiful ocean and it will for a long time to come. So, congratulations to [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] and, frankly, [GPE]. But I want to just thank everybody for being here and this is a true honor for me to sign this order. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}

[ORG] is really, what a job they have done, and I am thrilled to be back in the heart of [GPE] with the proud conservative patriots, who are courageously leading the battle to frankly save our country. That is what it is about. For [DATE] before election, the fake news media said [GPE] was in play. It is in play. You know what in play means? Like it is close. And they were right, except it was totally in play for me. For me and you, actually. No, it was in play for me. They said, The polls have closed in [GPE]. [SPEAKER]has won [GPE]. But how long did we listen to it? It was in play. it will never be in play if we have the right candidate. This state is never going to be in play. this is a very, very special place, and we are going to keep it the way it is, and we are going to bring back your energy.

Thank you very much. Thank you, fellows. Warriors. Truly are, they are truly warriors. And countless other conservative leaders and politicians and people that we love and we respect, and we are fighting with and we are fighting for. For [DATE], the [NORP] conservative union has helped lead the charge to defend our values, protect our country, and preserve our glorious [NORP] heritage. You see they are taking our heritage away. That is not going to happen. Not going to happen. We were doing so well until the rigged election happened to come along. We were doing really well. But [DATE] that heritage is under threat like never before. Who would have thought this could have happened? Even [PERSON] is saying, I never thought this could happen. He is mild by comparison. In [DATE] [DATE], [PERSON] has brought our country to the brink of ruin. Right here in [GPE] we are the epicenter of a border and migration crisis unlike anything anyone has ever seen before in the history of our country. At the same time, they have totally obliterated your energy industry. I told you. Under my administration, we achieved a historic reduction in illegal immigration. Never happened before to that extent, and not even close. We ended the horrible catch and release, where we catch a criminal and release him into our country. We actually said, Nope, it is called stay in [GPE]. And it worked very well, and we had the support of [GPE]. Who else could do that? And you have a great president of [GPE], a friend of mine. He is done a great job. We are on opposite sides of the spectrum, but we got along great, and he is been terrific, and I appreciate it. We stopped asylum fraud, and we struck critical agreements with other countries to stop illegal immigration. We called it, in fact, remain in [GPE]. You do not come here. Get released, and you never see these people again. They do not come back. They say, Come back in [DATE] for a court case. Only the really not smart ones. I want to be nice. Only the real not smart ones come back, which is [PERCENT]. We reduced drugs pouring across our border by the highest percentage ever. History of our country. Not just people. We shut down the migrant caravans. You have not seen those caravans. Get ready, because they are coming up right now. You have been watching them come through. In those caravans, you have some deadly people. We dealt a crippling blow to MS-13. We deported criminal aliens by the [CARDINAL], and we built [QUANTITY] of border wall, the exact wall that the border patrol wanted. I thought we could use nice concrete plank. Just knock it out. They said, Sir, we want steel, concrete, and rebar. And it has to be wired, sir. So we can all the drones the [NORP] Remember they wanted drones? I said, Drones are not going to stop people. Do you remember the statement during the campaign? [CARDINAL] things. Everything's obsolete like [DATE] after they come up with it nowadays. Computers, everything obsolete. They got a better one. [CARDINAL] things, right? What are they? Wheels and walls. They never change. In [DATE], you will say, Wheels and walls. Walls work. Walls work. Just ask [PERSON]. She has a nice wall around her house. Now the [PERSON] administration has turned the border into the single greatest disaster in [NORP] history, and perhaps in world history. Nobody's ever seen a border like this. Other countries do not have a border like this. Illegal border crossings are up over 1, 000% from [DATE]. Think of this. Think of this For [DATE], more illegal alien minors have arrived than [DATE] in [GPE] states history. This is the major pipeline for MS-13. These are the worst gang members, they say, anywhere in the world. They bring recruits to every state in our country. they run it like a business. But not with me. We were throwing them the hell out of here so fast. [ORG], [ORG]. [ORG], the great patriots. Tough people, [ORG]. And they have been disrespected. We cannot have them disrespected. Border patrol. [PERSON]'s here some place, probably. Where the hell is [PERSON]? He is so great. What a job he is done. Yes, thank you. Thank you. [ORG] and border patrol. Overall, illegal youth arrives, and arrivals are up [PERCENT]. Think of that, and they are being resettled in cities and towns all across [GPE] at tax payers' expense. And the people in those cities and towns have no idea that they are coming. The tax payers will also be forced to pay for relatives to be flown from Central America to join them. Did you ever hear of chain migration? You come in illegally, and we will also bring your mother, your father, your grandparents, your brothers, your sisters, your aunts, your uncles. Anybody else want to come in? Come on in. We had on [FAC]. He was driving rapidly down [FAC] at a very excessive speed. [GPE], Hudson River, beautiful new park. And he saw people working out. A big group of people, and he decided to make a right turn, and he killed many, and he maimed many. People go out because they want to put themselves in shape, and they end up going back home missing a leg, missing a couple of arms, or dead. That is what happened. And he had the right to bring people in with him. His family, his mother and father, and his brother. And he had many that he brought in, but we took very good care of him. But this administration does not do that. Many of these children, for the first time ever, it is a terrible thing that is happening to them, are on suicide watch. They end up in a place that they have no idea where it is. No idea. Not the border. Our whole country has become a border. Meanwhile, [ORG] removals are at the lowest level ever, and they are great people. They are patriots and they are tough. The agency has been functionally shut down. All of [GPE]'s now [CARDINAL] giant sanctuary city. We were fighting sanctuary cities, and doing very well. They are meant for criminal aliens. That is what they are meant for. Under our administration, we sent a very different message to the coyotes, human traffickers, child smugglers, vicious criminal cartels, and savage [ORG] gang members. When I was president, illegal alien criminals knew that if they trespassed across our border, they would be caught, they would be detained, and they would be sent to jail, or we would send them the hell back to where they came from. We created the most secure border in all of [NORP] history by far. [PERSON]'s border crisis is also helping drive an unprecedented crime wave, and you see the crime wave. Even without this you see all in [NORP] run cities. Please remember that. The bloodshed and violence in these cities is reaching epidemic proportions. Homicides are up [PERCENT] in [GPE], [PERCENT] in [GPE], [PERCENT] in [GPE], and [PERCENT] in [GPE] over [DATE]. Think of that. [GPE]. What they did to [GPE], and nothing happens to [ORG], and nothing happens to [ORG]. But to people that are patriots or conservatives or [NORP], they stay in jails for extended periods of time, and they destroy their lives. We are not going to take it anymore. In [GPE], crime is out of control. It is at record levels with nobody being prosecuted except of course innocent [NORP] are being prosecuted. The [NORP] know their policies on crime are so unpopular, so radical, so crazy, they are now trying to pretend they never led the defund the police movement in the first place. Disinformation. We never said defund the police. You know who did it? The [NORP] did it. That is what they do. It is called disinformation. How about [GPE]? [SPEAKER] had to do with [GPE]. He loves [GPE]. He loves [PERSON]. He loves everybody. Turned out to be the [NORP], right? After [DATE], they figured, gee. And after awhile, people actually believed this stuff. But now they are saying, Defund the police. We did not say it. It was the [NORP]. It is called disinformation. You have to be wise to it. It is very simple. If you support defunding the police, vote for the radical left [NORP], and you see what is happening to the cities where they defunded the police. There is never been anything like it. If you want more police and more cops on the streets, vote for [GPE] first [NORP] or let us put it very simply, vote for MAGA. Make [GPE] great again. MAGA. MAGA, MAGA, MAGA. The same far left [NORP] who are defunding police are also leading an all out crusade to strip you, the law abiding citizens of [GPE], of your God given Second Amendment rights. I told you again. I told you. I told you. And I preserved that right [PERCENT], and you think that was easy? It was not easy. There was so much pressure. There was so much pressure. [NORP] must never waiver in demanding that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Cannot let it happen. Thank you. Thank you very much. But it is not only the Second Amendment that the leftists want to destroy. They are hard at work to abolish the First Amendment as well. Probably all amendments, when you get right down to it. Why not? The radical left and big tech's attack on free speech is unlawful. It is unconstitutional, and it is completely [NORP]. To protect the Constitutional rights and liberties of every citizen, [DATE] I filed a major class action. Lot of people are joining. Yep. A big class action lawsuit against the big tech giants. We are suing [ORG], [ORG], and [ORG]. And to show you the arrogance, I was just talking to [ORG], I guess. [PERSON], you announced that they are trying to take this incredible, I think much more than [PERCENT] of our country. I really do. Because there is no way they can be [PERCENT] with defund the police, sanctuary cities. And all of the crazy things that they espouse. There is now way. But I heard they just filed where they want to take everybody down. Honestly, they are going too far. They are going too far. They are so spoiled. It is like a spoiled child. I want that toy, dad. But I also want this one, this one, this one. Eventually bad things happened. We are taking [PERSON], [PERSON], and the other Silicon Valley billionaires to federal court, and we will keep on fighting until we have stopped this assault on our liberties and until we have restored the sacred right to freedom of speech for every single [NORP]. Who would have thought? Who would have thought? Who would have thought? Could anybody believe we are even talking about this subject [DATE], [DATE]? Who would have believed it? In addition to their malicious attacks on free speech, these Silicon Valley tyrants are also attacking our democracy itself. The big tech election interference in [DATE] was an outrageous assault upon our Republic and upon the [NORP] voter. Terrible thing has happened to our country. We are being laughed at all over the world. Our election has been studied by other countries. They are not going to do it that way. [PERSON] alone spent [MONEY] on election meddling. In virtually all of the key swing states, he funded unmanned and unprotected drop boxes that were deployed in [NORP] run cities and heavily [NORP] precincts to scoop up ballots which were supposedly [PERCENT] for [PERSON], because he campaigned so well from his basement. How about where [PERSON] did substantially better in the swing states than [PERSON] with the black population? Now, even though he did terribly throughout the country. But in those [CARDINAL] places, he did very well. You know about that, [PERSON], right? He did [CARDINAL] places, he did very well. Beat [PERSON] with the black population. I do not think so. But they practiced that and countless other schemes to illegitimately and illegally boost the [NORP] vote. The drop boxes were often very late. Where are they? Where are they? What happened? They are supposed to be here. They are not. I can tell you what happened. Sometimes late by [DATE] in showing up to the vote counting areas. At the same time, the big tech giants worked together to suppress and diminish news coverage that was negative for [PERSON]. Look at all these stories that came up, and they were wiped out. Anything negative for [PERSON] or the radical left [NORP], they just suppressed. And the most horrendous example, the oldest newspaper in [GPE], and one of my favorites. It is a great one. [ORG] broke [CARDINAL] of the biggest scandals ever to emerge in a presidential election, providing extraordinarily detailed evidence of the corruption of [PERSON] and where is [PERSON]? You know where he is? He is painting right now for [CARDINAL] a piece. Where is [PERSON]? His highest and best use, I can tell you, is in a studio to paint. Even though he is never painted before. He set a record for the highest price for a person that never painted a picture before. Never did a painting before. Then without any basis whatsoever, [ORG] and [ORG] banned [ORG] account of this terrible story. After the election, [CARDINAL] poll showed that [PERCENT] of [PERSON] voters would have switched their vote if they had known about [PERSON] and [PERSON]'s scandals, enough to flip the results of numerous states. But do not worry about it, because we won those states anyway. We won them all. Probably the only thing I disagree with. It would not have mattered. They would have found the votes. They would have found those votes. If it was reported, they would have found the votes. Little more, they would have churned out some more ballots. The truth was covered up, and it had a giant impact on the election. This must never happen to another party's presidential candidate again. Can never happen. We are a laughing stock all over the world. A laughing stock. And you know who knows it better than even the people in this room? [NORP]. They know it. Furthermore, these big tech companies interfered with and undermined the sacred integrity of the ballot box by censoring any honest discussion of election fraud. You say election fraud, you get canceled. That is the [CARDINAL] thing they want to stay away from. The cancel culture, they are very tough on it. But the thing they really do not want is because we are too close to home. We got too close. Read [ORG] magazine from [DATE], the cover story. They could not help themselves. It does not go all the way, but it goes far enough, and you see what- It does not go all the way, but it goes far enough and you see what they did. They want to stay away from talking about the election results. Every time the media references the election hoax, they say the fraud is unproven. And while there is no evidence No evidence? There is so much evidence. You saw what happened in [GPE] [DATE]. They found [CARDINAL] votes. Then they deleted in [GPE] [CARDINAL], 000 votes. Because they were so bad voters, I said, Why did not you try doing it before the election? Lost by this much. Why did not you do it before the election? There is bad things going on in this country, very bad things. We always had the reputation of being a wonderful, brilliant country for voting, and now everyone knows. They have watched, they are very smart, and they see what happened. The governor of [GPE] and [GPE] secretary of state let us down. They let us down. And by the way, the voting law they passed is far weaker than that of [GPE] and other states. You hear that, Mr. Attorney General? They do not even have signature verification. Could you imagine passing a voting law? But they are getting a little good because everyone thinks, Oh, they are passing this no, it is not. And you notice they are the only state that is being sued by the federal government. You know why? Because it is an easy target, because the governor and the secretary of state will not defend like that guy will defend. So I only speak the truth. So true. And the reason the Attorney General of [GPE] is going after [GPE] is it is so bad what they have done, and they will probably win, and that defense will not take place. They go out and they really worked very hard on finding the right state to look at. Now [PERSON] in [GPE] got them to sign what is called a mandated consent decree, which was not approved by the legislature, therefore it is illegal, and makes it very easy for [NORP] to cheat and to win elections. You do not have too many of them in [GPE], do you, [PERSON]? [PERSON], do we have the great [PERSON], my doctor, became a Congressman. He only beat [CARDINAL] people. [CARDINAL] people, he was great. I said, [PERSON], how about if I take a cognitive test? He said, Well, you can do it, sir. But if you do, it'll be public. Well, I said, What is wrong with that? He said, Well, if you do not do well, sir, it is not going to be pretty. I said, Is it hard? He said, After the first [CARDINAL] questions, it gets very hard. I said, Let us take a shot at it, and we did it and we aced it, right? I aced it. And one of the doctors said he is never seen anybody that aced it. And some of those questions are not easy. I will tell you that. How do you think [PERSON] would do on a cognitive test? You never know. Maybe he is underneath there, there is somebody that is very unusual. Unfortunately, this was an election where the person that counts the votes was far more important than the candidate, no matter how many votes that candidate got, and we got record numbers of votes. It is a disgrace to our nation and we are truly being scorned and disrespected all over the world. Never forget that the radical left is not the majority in this country. We are the majority and it is not even close. It is not even close. [crosstalk [TIME]] And when you look at their policies, there is just no way that can happen. There is no way. Weak military. They fight against the military, always fighting budgets, military. We need strong military right now, so strong. And having rebuilt the [GPE] military is one of my greatest achievements. It was a sick and tired military. The equipment was old and depleted. And now we have those brand new F-35s and everything's brand new, and we have a great military, or it is coming soon and they will not be able to stop it. But the radical left cheat in elections and the fake news media cheats in polling, like having me down [CARDINAL] points just before the election in [GPE]. [SPEAKER] [ORG], [ORG], just before now when people hear that, it is called suppression, they say, We love the president, but we are going to stay home. Let us watch television, [PERSON]. I said, That is a good idea. [PERSON]'s going to stay home with [PERSON]. I am down [CARDINAL] points, and I felt I was winning the state, and we did, in my opinion, win the safe, but it was very close. Even by their fake numbers, it was very close. I'd have it down [CARDINAL] points. And interestingly in [DATE], the exact same thing happened. They had me down [CARDINAL] points. Same people, [ORG], [ORG], suppression. I was down [CARDINAL] points and I won the state. So that is a fake poll. It should be illegal. It is a fake poll. The same people at least they got better. They had [CARDINAL] instead of [CARDINAL]. But I was down [DATE]. We got her by surprise in [DATE]. They said, We are never going to let that happen again. That is what happened. [NORP] do not support the woke left. The people are with us. You have no idea how much. In a recent, highly respected [ORG] poll, [PERCENT] of voters say the media is truly the enemy of the people. Think of that, [PERCENT], and [PERCENT] disagreed. Nobody can tell me that defunding the police, open borders, raising your taxes it used to be, you are running for office, We are going to cut your taxes. This is the only time in history, We are going to raise your taxes. Oh, I am going to vote for him. I want to raise them. And they are raising your taxes so you can waste this money on the Green New Deal, which is nonsense. So they want to put back the regulations. I took off more regulations than any president in history. And that is what gave us really I actually think, [PERSON], it was more important than the taxes, than cutting taxes. But we took off the regulations. Used to take [DATE] to get highways approved and roads approved, and we got it down to [CARDINAL], and we are going to try and get it down to [CARDINAL]. Well, we were going to get it down to [CARDINAL]. Now we are going to have to wait a little while I guess. It will get back up to [CARDINAL] pretty soon, and then we will bring it down [DATE]. You just wait and see. The [NORP] are terrible on policy, but they are very vicious and they are smart and they stick together. They do not have [PERSON] and little [PERSON] and [PERSON]. How about [PERSON]? He campaigns in the great state of [GPE]. He compaigns that he is [[PERSON]]'s friend. Every ad has [SPEAKER] in it. [SPEAKER], [SPEAKER], [SPEAKER], [SPEAKER], and then he votes to impeach me. Can you believe it? But I always sort of felt that about that guy. Lightweight. But you have another very good senator there, [PERSON]. He is very good. Very good senator. And [PERSON] cannot walk down the streets of [GPE] without having nasty things said to him, and they do not have anyone, the [NORP], like the warmonger and most quoted [NORP] in the history of our country by [NORP], [PERSON]. She is quoted all the time. Every time a [NORP] gets up to make a speech you know this, fellows, right? You have to live with her, I guess. Maybe not much longer. But every time they get up to make a speech, And to quote [PERSON] [NORP] are ruthless, but they are united. They do not have these [PERSON] types. They do not have them. It must be wonderful to live like that, but they have bad policy and they have policy that is going to destroy our country. Like socialists and communists movements throughout history, [DATE]'s leftists do not believe in freedom, they do not believe in fairness, and they do not believe in democracy. They believe in [NORP] morality. Anything is justified as long as it hurts their political opponents and advances the radical agenda of their party. It is a radical agenda like nobody has seen before. Before our very eyes, the radical left [NORP] are turning the law itself into a weapon for partisan persecution. It is persecution. It is really look at what they are doing to incredible people like [PERSON]. I mean, he is an incredible greatest mayor in the history of the city of [GPE], great crime fighter. And at the same time, they are weaponizing the [ORG] against conservatives and [NORP] just like they did with the tea party, except worse. There are now [CARDINAL] sets of laws in this country, [CARDINAL] for the left wing mob, the rioters and the rampagers who can do whatever the hell they want to whomever they want to do it. And there is another set of rules for law-abiding, conservative [NORP], happen to be [NORP], who simply want to speak their minds and exercise their rights, like to talk about a rigged election. But [PERSON] and I mean that. He is by far the greatest mayor of the city. And now you realize, it means more right now, [PERSON], that it would have meant [DATE] when you say that, because you see what the hell is happening to our cities, [GPE] in particular. But one of the great crime fighters of his generation has had his law license taken away by the radical left, all because he was fighting against an election result that he saw was corrupt. That means you can never, ever fight anything. That means someday it could swing the other way, right? It could swing the other way. Probably will not for a long time, but we are not letting it happen. Under the standard that has now been applied to [PERSON], lawyers are no longer free to represent their clients and their livelihood itself depends on [CARDINAL] thing only, whether or not they want to fight the corruption. Think of it. [PERSON] fought because he saw the election was rigged. And because he fought, they took away his law license in [GPE] and in [GPE], [GPE]. And this is a great man. This is a man I lived in [GPE]. You could walk down the streets. You were proud of the city. You are not proud of the city anymore. You are not proud of what is happening. While many [NORP] fought viciously and got caught lying about the [DATE] election they were lying nothing happened. [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE]. You remember [GPE]? I see [PERSON] here. Where is [PERSON]? Stand up, [PERSON]. When I came in, he was in the basement of an office building, the basement of [ORG]. They said, Sir, there is a Congressman. He is going through files and files because he knew that what shifty [PERSON] was saying was pure bullshit. You got it. You understood it. It was made up bull. And he and another great one I could give it to everybody here, frankly, as far as I am concerned, because they are great. And you have a star on your left. Stand up. Our star. Thank you, [PERSON]. Thank you. [PERSON] always knows who to sit next to, but [PERSON] received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, along with [PERSON] of [GPE] for the incredible courage they showed. Thank you very much. But he got it a long time ago with, [GPE], [GPE], [GPE]. I tell this story, during the campaign guys would come up to me and we are doing well. This is [DATE]. We are doing well Sir, do you know anything about [GPE]? No. What am I supposed to know? [GPE], I know [GPE]. But I do not know [DATE], a guy come up, different. Sir, what do you have to do with [GPE]? Do you have anything to do with her? No. Why do you ask? Then after [CARDINAL] guys coming up, I'd say, What the hell is going on with [GPE]? And it was a scam. And then we went through [DATE] with [PERSON] and there was no collusion. Oh, they wanted remember? [CARDINAL] angry [NORP], oh they went after us. They will send everything into [GPE]. They will give it a shot now. [CARDINAL], they have already done that. In fact, it is photocopies they used. They used photocopies of the same stuff I beat in [GPE]. If anyone should be losing their jobs, their law licenses, and being investigated for crimes, it is not [PERSON], it is [PERSON]. [PERSON] is a very dishonest guy. He used to stand up at a microphone and he used to lie like hell. I'd say, This guy is He'd stand up, This is [DATE] for our union. [[PERSON]] works for [GPE]. I'd say, What the hell is he talking about? And I am the one that exposed [GPE] for the biggest thing they have ever done, the pipeline to Europe. I shut it down, and now [PERSON] opened it up. They are going to make a fortune. But guys like [PERSON] and [PERSON] and [PERSON], and remember the [CARDINAL] lovers, [PERSON] and [PERSON]? All of the other perpetrators who have faced no consequences whatsoever, even though they knew it was a scam that they created. They created a scam. And I must be honest with you, I have never said this because I did not want to, but I will. I am very disappointed that [PERSON] was unable to hold anyone accountable for the countless abuses of power by the [NORP]. We did not hold the corrupt officials who spied on our campaign remember I said, They are spying on our campaign. And boy, that was like a lightning rod went off. Not the authors of the phony dossier, they were not held responsible. Not the women who slandered and lied and defamed [PERSON]. They said, [PERSON], he had an affair. They did not go after them. They lied so badly. Not any of the numerous criminal referrals for lying to [ORG] over and over again. Not any of the illegal leakers, not any of the people that were responsible for corrupting our elections. There is no greater crime. He wanted nothing to do with it. He just did not want to do it. But perhaps it is understandable because he did become a different man. I always liked him. But I said, [PERSON], you got to move your ass. Our country is under attack. But he became a different man when the [NORP] viciously stated that they wanted to impeach him. They went wild. We want to impeach him. We are going to impeach [PERSON]. We are going to impeach him. He became different. I understand that. I did not become different. I got impeached twice. I did not change. I became worse. So I guess I can understand it. But I [DATE] received a statement from the [GPE] attorney, highly respected, in [GPE], that [PERSON] would not allow him to investigate voter fraud. Can you believe it? Now, you have to understand, [GPE] is the second most corrupt place so I understand, okay? So I understand in the nation. You know what first is? [GPE]. [GPE] was so corrupt. [GPE] was so corrupt. But the [GPE] attorney was not allowed to investigate what this just came out in a letter. You do not even know about this, [PERSON], right? [PERSON], that is a big one. What do you think? We have a letter. You will have to get it from him because I want to stay out of it. Get it from the [GPE] attorney, but I am sure he will be willing to provide it, but he is given it to us. He was not allowed to do his job. And I saw that. He was all enthused, and then all of a sudden it was like he was turned off. And so were others. This was true with so many others that when the justice department, they failed to call out the [TIME] ballot stuffing that took place in [GPE]. Remember that? Where they made up a story of a water main break in order to get people and security to leave the premises, and then they went into a rampage of stuffing, essentially, the ballots. But now that event, because of me and some very good people, is in court. Let us see how that one turns out. And [PERSON] told me, Sir, we have looked at it. We found nothing. All you have to do is look at that tape. By the way, there was no water main. Remember? There was no water main. Remember that? I said to them, But what about the water main? Oh, I did not hear about that. Well, I heard about it. There was no water main break. They said there was, and the people ran, except a group of people came back. Boom, boom, boom. That one is easy. All you have to do is look at the tape. It is incredible what tapes can show. The fact is, [NORP] play a much nicer, kinder game than the [NORP], but based on what we have seen and what we are witnessing now with all of the prosecutorial and other misconduct going on, perhaps [NORP] will have to rethink their game plan. [PERSON] would agree with that. [PERSON], I have to be careful with him. Do not say I said it, but actually [PERSON]'s worse than any [NORP], but we have to hold him back. We hold him back, [PERSON], right? What do you think of that, [PERSON]? You just heard something for the first time. Pretty amazing, is not it? And by the way, where is [PERSON]? He disappeared. Why did not they use the very well-done Horowitz Report? And it was very well done. It is incredible. This is the [ORG] report. I am [PERSON]. Former [SPEAKER] speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in [GPE]. Let us listen in live. Even [ORG] wrote the most vicious editorial about [PERSON] based on the [PERSON] report, which talked about the crimes and bad acts committed by [PERSON], [PERSON] and others. This is even before you go with [PERSON]. I'd like to thank Inspector General [PERSON] for that report. It should have been used. They did not want to use it. I guess it is deep state. I do not know what the hell they are thinking. Deep state? Is there something ? But if you cannot wait for [PERSON], just read a man named [PERSON]'s brilliant thread on Twitter. He tells the whole story. You got to read it. As he put it, We know as fact the [PERSON] dossier was the sole evidence just to justify spying on the [SPEAKER] campaign. Think of it. They spied on my campaign and nothing will happen to them. Think of it. Can you imagine if I spied on [PERSON]'s campaign or [PERSON]'s campaign? Could you imagine what would have happened? They spied on my campaign, we caught them, and nothing happened. The [ORG] knew the [PERSON] dossier was a [ORG] operation, paid for by [ORG] and crooked [PERSON], who by the way, is the most angry person in [GPE] [DATE]. She is gone away. You know why? She said, Why the hell did not you do that for me in [DATE]? I got it. [crosstalk [TIME] Again, there are more people than her. No, she said, Why did not you do it for me? Actually, the race was much closer. [ORG] asked me a question, what happened in [DATE] that was different from [DATE]? I said, Well, I will tell you. We did much better in [DATE]. We got [CARDINAL] more votes. We won by a much bigger margin. [DATE] was very close, but [PERSON] said, Why did not you do that for me? Why did not you cheat for me, damn it? I could have been somebody. Could have been somebody. [PERSON]'s source told the [ORG] the info, was totally unserious, and they did not inform the court of any of this, and they kept on spying on the [SPEAKER] campaign. In addition, the press is part of this crooked operation. You know that. Election rules were changed. Big tech censored the opposition. Political violence was legitimized and encouraged by the left. And then [[PERSON]], the President of [GPE], was banned from the social media, as we call it, by sleazebags I was banned by sleazebags. I was banned by bad people. They are far worse I do not say I am perfect, but they are far worse than I am. They are far I would not say I am perfect, but they are far worse than I am. I [inaudible 00:48:03]. They are far worse. In other words, the entire system was rigged against the [NORP] people and rigged against a fair, decent, and honest election. For [DATE], the conservative movement acted as if all that mattered were policy fights in [GPE] or that all it would take to prevail was winning a small handful of [ORG] cases. And we are disappointed in [ORG]. I am disappointed, but the battle is so much bigger and so much broader than any of that. The radical left has been methodically taking over every giant centralized institution in [NORP] life. The school systems, you see that, the universities, the bar associations, look at what happened to [PERSON] [GPE] journalists, the big banks, big tech, and even [ORG] where we are getting some unexpected rulings because the [CARDINAL] justices do not want to be packed. And the [NORP] are in a position to pack the court and they do not want to be packed. So they do not want to look at the election. They said, we do not want to see it. We had by that gentleman right there from the great state of [GPE], we had [CARDINAL] states. And we thought we had a case where the standing was so good. You know, I wanted to do it personally, but they said, Sir, you are the president. You have no standing. I said, What kind of a system? Wait [TIME]. I am the president. They said, The thing that has the standing are states. And if you could get [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] They got [CARDINAL] and they were really strong about it. And you know, the justices never looked at the case. They did not look. And many of the judges did not look at the case, but we do have cases going on right now where I think you have patriot judges. And we will see. We are going to see if that happens. But if the justices got their way, they will not be packed. In other words, what happened is vicious things. Look at the [PERSON] statement that he said when he was on the court steps. So, he is no longer protected because he is not In [ORG], if you are a guy like [PERSON], you can lie and lie and lie. You cannot do anything, you have immunity. But once you step out of that building, [PERSON] said horrible things. He said a mafia like statement to the judges. Nothing happens, nothing happens. But they are playing the ref, you know, playing the ref? Even better than the great [PERSON] in his prime. I love [PERSON]. He came out from great state of [GPE]. He came out, he endorsed me. It was over in [GPE], but [PERSON] used to scream at the refs. And they'd say, Why are you doing that? You are never going get to get the call changed. No, no. I am not worried about this goal. But the next call, they will be thinking about That is what is happening with our [ORG]. That is what is happened. They do not want to be packed. We do not want to have [CARDINAL] judges. You know, they said [CARDINAL]. I said, the [NORP] are too smart for [CARDINAL]. It is an unlucky number. Why would they have [CARDINAL]? So they will make it [CARDINAL], but they will probably make it [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL]. It will go up. And you know, if they would've looked at the case, we would have won that case in my opinion. And they would have never been packed because you would've had a beautiful veto sitting right in the oval office. I would have vetoed it because it is a terrible thing. But the [NORP] are vicious to [ORG] and to [PERSON]. He is another one. Yeah, [PERSON], they screamed, we are going to impeach him. We are going to impeach him. And it changes people. And how about [PERSON]? We are going to impeach him on women that admitted ultimately that nothing happened. They were not even in the country, [CARDINAL] of them. It was all a made up scam. They should be prosecuted. They should be prosecuted. And they were not . But with [PERSON], they are screaming, We are going to impeach him every time [inaudible [TIME]]. And we are going to impeach him. And you know what? How does he get out of that by voting for the [NORP]? So it is a very sad thing. And he went through what no other person I have ever seen go through. That hearing was the most vicious, horrible hearing I think in the history of our country. I do not think there is ever been anything worse than that. In [GPE] and state, far left [NORP] actually ran for office promising to prosecute me, my family, and my company, without knowing anything about me. I never even heard of these people. They did not know nothing about me. We are going to get him. We are going to get him. We are going to get [SPEAKER]. And she won. She won. A lot of people running, she won on the basis, We are going to get him. What did he do? I do not know, but we will find something. No, no, how would you like this? They are in search of a crime. To them, it did not matter whether any laws had been broken. The crime was opposing the radical left [NORP] party. This is lawless and tyrannical behavior. It is a political persecution, like something straight out of the communist countries that you see around the world. The few that are left. Yet, it is happening here in [GPE] at the hands of radical left [NORP]. And the [NORP] again, they just do not seem to understand at that top level, what the hell is happening. They do not do it the same way. And maybe they are going to have to change our job. And our mission is to resist this poison and fight for our Republic, with all of our heart and with all of ourselves. For [DATE], the career politicians who sold out our country shipped away our [CARDINAL] of jobs and sent our children to die in endless foreign wars have gotten away with the most flagrant corruption imaginable. These people sold out our country. As vice-president [PERSON] flew his son [PERSON] around the world on Air Force Two, sucking up money like a vacuum cleaner, [PERSON]'s emails show that he collected [MONEY] from foreign nations, including [GPE]. While setting aside a cut to the big guy. Who is the big guy? That is [PERSON]. Well is that allowed to? And [PERSON] said, they are not getting [MONEY] unless that prosecutor is out. What the hell? Could you imagine if I said that? If I said that they impeached me and nothing happened. Can you imagine if I said, They are not getting their billionaire and voila, he was gone. He was bragging. I do not know what the hell he was thinking when he Did he know the tape was running when he did that? And nothing happens, nothing happens. You know why? Because [PERSON] is a nice man. [PERSON] and the [NORP] are too nice. They are too nice. These are vicious, vicious people. And they will destroy our country and they will do whatever they can to do it. [PERSON] said that he gave [CARDINAL] of his salary to pop and that he paid vast amounts of money for [PERSON] expenses. Now, [PERSON] has all these houses. He is always been like a Senator or a Congressman, right? For [DATE]. [PERSON], I did not know you made that kind of money that you had mansions. You have mansions? Does [PERSON] have mansions all over [GPE]? I do not think so. He is got [CARDINAL] house and that is enough. That is all you need, right [PERSON]? Wants to go home to his bathroom and his bedroom and use his [CARDINAL] toothbrush right? No, but [PERSON]'s got a lot of toothbrushes. Yet not a single member of our treacherous, corrupt political establishment has ever experienced anything like the deranged and demented persecution that has been directed at me, my family, and everyone associated with us, everybody. I came down the escalator with our great future first lady. She was great. She had a very successful career. Did really well until she met me and so much for that career. That is all right. She is cool. She is the coolest and most confident person. She gets it better than anybody. And she loves you people. She loves you, but that is when all of these witch hunts began. All because I put [GPE] first, all because of MAGA: Make [GPE] Great Again. And now, it is also because I got more votes, [CARDINAL], than anybody in the history of the presidency. And far more than [PERSON], far more than [PERSON], and a record [CARDINAL] more than [DATE]. Think of it, in the history, usually they go down a little bit second term and they win, but they go down a little bit. I was told by a great pollster, really somebody great, [PERSON], [CARDINAL] of the most respected one. Sir, you got [CARDINAL] votes. If you get it up to [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL], nobody can beat you. Cannot lose. Thank you [PERSON], very much. I got it to [CARDINAL] and I lost in quotes. I lost. It is a disgrace. It is a disgrace. And what they have done to this movement, I think they have made the movement stronger. I will tell you, in a certain way, I think that is. I will never forget it. On [TIME], we did so much better than they ever thought in their wildest imagination. That they just said, The hell with it. Let it go. What they did, what they did. I am also leading in the polls against [PERSON]. Because not a lot of people think that [PERSON]'s going to be running, but you never know. It is a strange world and everyone else who is going to run on the radical left, whether it is on the [NORP] side or the I love my [NORP], but we are really kicking their ass too. But we love them. But we like it because they are friends of ours, right? So it is okay. I think we can say that affectionately. No, they are great. They are great. And they are working hard and you saw a lot of them [DATE]. But the [NORP] want me out and they want me out as fast as possible. And here I am, I could have a nice, beautiful life. And here I am on [DATE] in [GPE]. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. No, I said to [PERSON] and [PERSON] because I have done this and we have had And by the way, you have a poll coming out. Unfortunately, I want to know what it is they You know, they do that straw poll, right? Now, if it is bad, I just say, It is fake. If it is good, I say, That is the most accurate poll perhaps ever. And I know that they it. I guess it gets announced after I want to find out, are you going to? Oh, he will not . He will not tell me. I know [PERSON], he will not tell me. Well, whenever the hell they get it released. I will tell you, here is the story. If it is bad, it'll be front page news in the newspapers. If it is great, they will not even cover it. I hate to tell you that, [PERSON]. And I do not want to convince him to do a bad [PERSON], but you know the straw poll. So, I did this [DATE] and I got these great straw polls. It was the first time I ever did it. And I was a novice, but it was right here at [ORG]. And I am so proud of the jump. I mean, look at this room. Look at outside. We have [CARDINAL] of people trying to come in. I mean our only thing is next time we will have to get a bigger place, I guess, right? Next time. But I said to [PERSON], and much more importantly, I said to [PERSON], I said, Give me Death Valley. Give me the worst time. The worst slot, we will fill it up. He said, Well, sir, that would be [DATE] [TIME] because most people are doing other things. I said, That is okay, [PERSON]. You do not have to give me [DATE] night or [DATE] [TIME], which is easy. That is too easy. We love doing it the hard way. I said, Give me any time you want on [DATE] that is good. I will fly in. And look at this crowd we got. And look at the love in this room. Look at the love. Nah, we will give [DATE] [TIME] to [PERSON] and to the doc. We will give [DATE] night We will give [DATE] [TIME], [PERSON]. We are going to give [DATE] [TIME] to [PERSON]. We are going to give somebody [DATE] [TIME], which is almost as good. They give me [DATE] and I love [DATE]. You know why? It reminds me of church and that is okay. But no I am honored that It really is. I said, Give me your worst time. I do not care. And he gives me the worst time. He actually did. And he just broke his record. The radical left and the failed political establishment hates our movement for a simple reason because together we took on the corrupt special interests. We faced down the open borders that you are saying so much, how bad are these borders. They are coming out of the prisons, they are coming out of everywhere in these other countries. They think we are so stupid. They are letting their prisoners out, floating in through the caravans, come into our country: murderers, drug dealers, human traffickers of women. It is mostly women. We stood up to the absurd dictates of political correctness. And we called out the people who were getting rich bleeding our country dry. And many of them were politicians. Against the howls and cries of the corporate interests and the [GPE] lobbyists, we demanded fair trade for the [NORP] workers and we did a great job on that. We finally ended the worst trade deal in the history of our country, [ORG]. [CARDINAL] of the worst trade deals. I do not want to disrespect our past, but the people that negotiated that deal were either stupid or corrupt. They say both. Could be. We withdrew from the horrible [ORG], would have destroyed your automobile business. We pulled out of the world health organization scam. You know, the world health organization. I pulled out because they are like a pipe organ for [GPE], right? So I pulled out. they called me, would they want us back? So, the guy, just nice guy, he wants us back. Sir, we really want you back. We really want you back. I said, How much are we paying? [CARDINAL] a year. How much is [GPE] paying? [CARDINAL] a year. I said, Okay. So let me ask you a question. We have [CARDINAL] people not including illegal aliens. Which who the hell knows. I do not think they have any idea what But we have [CARDINAL] people. [GPE] has [CARDINAL] people. They are paying [CARDINAL]. We are paying [CARDINAL]. So let me ask you a question. Would you take us back if we paid [CARDINAL]? Yes. I said, Okay, I am going to think about it. But when I pulled out, it was so popular. I could not even get back in for [DATE] because everybody including [PERSON] thought it was amazing that I pulled out because he understands it is a pipe organ for [GPE] and for others, but mostly for [GPE]. So I said, So, I would get back in for [CARDINAL]? Yes, sir. Okay. That was it. I did not go back in even at [DATE] and otherwise I turned it down. And now because of the rigged election, we are out, he is in. And he immediately says, We are going back in. He went back in for the same price that they were paying before. Now, you know what? [CARDINAL] in terms of when you are dealing with [CARDINAL] and all of this, it is not It is a lot of money. This is [DATE]. This is [DATE] we pay [CARDINAL]. They pay [CARDINAL]. Their country is much larger, but why would not they say we will do it for [CARDINAL] or in theory less? Let us in for [CARDINAL]. I think they would have taken it. In fact, [CARDINAL] of the reasons I was not happy, I should have started off lower, [PERSON]. Instead of [CARDINAL], I said, How about would you do it for [CARDINAL]? Proportional, right? So, they go back in and nobody said, We will go back in, but we want to come back in at [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL]. They said, We will go back in. We will go back in. And now they are going to be paying what we have been ripped off for [DATE]. And we do not have control of it. [GPE] has total absolute control. We have none. What do you think of that, [PERSON]? In the second row, our acting Attorney General, huh? Our acting You took a lot of abuse. Thank you, [PERSON]. Thank you for being here, up here. I just see you there. Thank you. So think of it. So, we have this deal and they just go in This is the way our country runs. It is the way our country runs. We built an aircraft carrier and the aircraft carrier has all sorts of problems. It is the Gerald Ford. They decided to use magnets for the elevators that bring Magnets. You are in the middle of the ocean, big waves, bullets being shot at your ship. You got magnets. I could take this little glass of water, drop it in the magnets, that is the end of the elevator. And then they throw the plane off and they decided to do it through electric instead of steam, right? Catapult it is called. So, they have a catapult. And for [DATE] it is been steam operated. They decide to do it. Let us make it out of electric. So, I go to the ship because it is been under construction for [DATE], it was going to cost [CARDINAL]. It is going to end up costing [CARDINAL]. But the bad news is it does not work. They even moved the tower from the center to the back of the ship, making it much harder for pilots to land. By the way, the single hardest thing for a pilot to do is land on an aircraft carrier, even great pilots cannot do it. If they are a little bit claustrophobic That carrier looks big, but when you are up there flying and moving along at rapid speeds, and you are looking at this massive ocean and you have a little deck that you have to land on, it is the hardest thing to do. So they move the thing back so it made it much tighter instead of putting it in the middle where it is a wider part of the ship, a whole thing. Another thing, what is under there? That is sir, where they keep the ammunition. I said, Wait a minute, they built the tower I do not want to be the captain of that ship by the way. So I said, I went to visit the ship and I was not interested in seeing the admiral, the admiral said, Sir Admiral so-and-so The things out to sea trials is not working. And I said, Admiral, honestly, I think you are a wonderful man. Very good looking guy. Actually, you are like central casting, but I want to see the catapulters. So, I meet these [CARDINAL] guys. Real great guys. They are catapulters. How long have you been doing it, [PERSON]? Sir, [DATE]. I said, Let me ask you, you have a problem with it? Absolutely, sir. It does not work. Why? He said, Because if it breaks, you have to go through graduate school at [ORG] to fix it. And with the steam, we had the same power or more and we could fix it with a blowtorch and a hammer. And I love that steam in my face, sir. I said, But seriously, which is better? He said, The steam. I said, Why did they go with electric? Because sir, it can go back and forth automatically [DATE]. I said, Is that good or bad? He said, Unnecessary because it takes us [TIME] to put the plane on and hook it up. And by the time we do that, sir, we are all set. We have so much steam we do not know what to do with it. So, I said, So you mean they spent all of this money. They spent [MONEY] as of [DATE] to try and fix it. Okay. [CARDINAL]. It will never work. I told them that three When I first came in, I am very good at this stuff. I said, [ORG]. Give me a glass of water. I will put it out of commission. I will throw it on the electric circuits. It is not going to work. And it is just, I mean, it is so we do things so stupidly. So they are at [MONEY]. And I said, did you sue the shipyard? No, sir. Then I meet with the architect. I said, You are the architect? Yes. Have you ever designed a ship before? My first question, Have you ever designed a ship before? I am telling you foreign countries are laughing at us. They are laughing at us. How stupid we are. We renegotiated the [GPE] trade deal and we built the greatest economy of the history of the world with a record [CARDINAL] people working. We were never close. And I do not want to see any negotiations of tax increases by [ORG] [NORP]. Because I see certain rhinos they keep walking over to [ORG]. They are getting fleeced. I feel so badly. You know, guys like [PERSON] and they walk over to [FAC]. The other [CARDINAL], the Senator from [GPE], he was over there. I do not want to name them all because a couple of them are fine, but they go over there, they are getting fleeced. They come out, we have a deal. We have a deal. Remember [GPE]? We have a deal. You do not want to get into that. We have a deal. They said they had a deal. [TIME] when the radical left heard that [PERSON] agreed to something they went crazy and then [PERSON] said, We do not have a deal anymore. They are getting fleeced. And what they are doing is they are saying, We will agree to raise your taxes. If you approve this Saying we will agree to raise your taxes if you approve this radical left infrastructure deal, where most of the money, almost none of the money's going to real infrastructure, which is roads, bridges, et cetera. I am telling the [NORP] senators right now that we are not going to stand for it if you raise our taxes. We had the greatest tax decrease in the history of our country, and we are not going to have you raise it. In order to say you have made a bipartisan deal. You know, they are dying to say, [PERSON], that we made a bipartisan deal. You do not have to do that, because you are getting fleeced. It is all green new deal stuff. It is nonsense. And it is going to destroy our country. And inflation's going to be a big problem. We cannot let it happen. Despite the pleading and begging of the outsourcers and globalists, I took on [GPE] like no president had ever done before. Imposing massive tariffs to protect [NORP] workers and bring jobs and factories and [MONEY] back. You know that? Back to our shores. We made a great deal with [GPE], which has immeasurably helped our farmers and manufacturers, and we put [ORG] on defense for the first time ever in our history of our country. We never took in [MONEY]. They are paying us [CARDINAL]. It is interesting. [PERSON], he wants to end the tariffs. If he does, [GPE] will take over the whole deal. Okay? But they are finding it hard to do. He campaigned on ending tariffs, which was stupid. Although maybe not so stupid, right? You know what happened. You know what happened. But he campaigned on ending tariffs. So ridiculous. We are taking [MONEY], and we convinced the world that we have to watch [GPE]. When I took over, we had a deficit with [GPE] of [MONEY]. That is not sustainable. [CARDINAL]. Not [CARDINAL]. [CARDINAL]'s a lot. [MONEY]. But now [GPE] is totally on the offense, making [PERSON] and our country look [DATE], and pathetic. We ignored the hysterics of the socialist left and withdrew from the unfair [CARDINAL] sided [GPE] climate accord. [CARDINAL] of the great rip offs. Would have cost us [MONEY]. We unleashed [GPE]'s energy resources, and achieved [NORP] energy independence for the first time in the history of our country. And we do not need windmills in [GPE] and lots of other places. We do not need windmills. They ought to end that program as quickly as they can. When the plague came in from [GPE], I dragged the slow and complacent bureaucrats from the [ORG], and the [ORG] into [FAC]. I pushed them like they have never been pushed before, and thanks to the relentless efforts of my administration and me, we got miraculous therapeutics straight to patients with historic speed, and we produced [CARDINAL] vaccines to end the pandemic in record time. Would have never happened. Would have never happened. We did it in [DATE]. They said [DATE], probably [DATE], and sir, it probably will not happen at all. If we did not have that, we would be in a position like perhaps over a 100 years ago, right? [DATE]. [CARDINAL] people, I hear different number. But perhaps [CARDINAL] people died. We beat back the failed foreign policy establishment to withdraw from the disastrous [GPE] nuclear deal. We recognized [GPE] as [GPE]'s capital, and [NORP] sovereignty over the Golan Heights. We ended the endless wars in [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and other countries. And we brought our beautiful troops back home. Now terrible things are happening in [GPE]. We had everything in place to finish withdrawing responsibly, and [PERSON] is turning it into a total disaster. They do not respect him. He is leaving behind [MONEY] of equipment. I told these generals, I want every nail brought back home. I want the tanks brought back home. I want it all brought back home. Instead, the [ORG] is now parading around with our weapons that [PERSON] allowed them to capture. It is a disgrace. But with all of that being said, we should get out. [DATE] is enough. [DATE]. [DATE] is enough. Everything we do, we refuse to bow down to the radical left, the RINOs, the political establishment, and instead we insist on standing up for [GPE], and making [GPE] great again and always putting [GPE] first. [GPE]'s got to be first. [DATE], more people are realizing that we were right on all of the key issues, and that this is [CARDINAL] reason why our endorsement has become, and it is really not just my endorsement, it is your endorsement, has become the most powerful weapon in politics. [DATE], exact numbers. Because if they were not exact, they will come out at me, you would not believe. [CARDINAL] of the [CARDINAL] candidates we endorsed in [NORP] primary elections won. So think of that. And the [CARDINAL] that did not , actually they turned out to be great [SPEAKER] people. They really did. They turned out to be great. But we had a great string of endorsements. We love the candidates we endorse. We are endorsing a lot of good ones right now in the [ORG] primary elections. We were undefeated, [DATE] and [DATE]. [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL]. Cannot say I am happy about all of them, but that is okay. So far in the [DATE] election cycle, we are already [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] on endorsements, and you are going to check this. Oh, they will be checking [DATE]. [PERSON], they are going to be up there [TIME] checking. Oh, they want to find it is not. It is not [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL], it is [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL]. He lied, he lied. He is a terrible person. In the face of the [PERSON] administration's far left campaign to transform our country and erase our history, we are not backing down. We will never back down. When we regain control of [ORG], we will immediately regain control of our border, and it is not that easy. I watched a lot of good Congressmen get onto it. What we have to do is redo the [SPEAKER] edict. It is not that easy. We negotiated with those countries, and it was not simple. Very complex. We had it better than ever before. It is so sad to see what happened. We will hold [GPE] accountable for the damage and suffering they have caused, and make them pay [MONEY] in reparations to us and to the world. We will break up the big tech monopolies, and bring back free speech. We cannot let this continue. We will take back our elections, and finally, we will always include a thing called voter ID. That is another thing. The [NORP] are now saying, Oh, we always wanted voter ID. There was a poll. [PERCENT] of the people in the country want voter ID, so now the [NORP] again, same old story. They are saying, We want voter ID. We have always wanted voter ID. These people are sick. We will completely defund and bar critical race theory. [DATE], not [DATE], if you do not mind. And if government run schools are going to teach children to hate their country, we will demand school choice that we already have. If you listen to the media or watch the [TIME] newscast, our country has really gone bad. All we talk about is race. That is all they talk about. Race. The whole show. race, race. We do not talk about our country being great anymore. We do not talk about how [GPE] can lead the world. We do not talk about stopping crime or the [CARDINAL] of people that are being shot in [NORP] run cities and what to do about it. We do not talk about ending the drugs pouring across our borders. Which I had greatly reduced with our wall and so many other things that we are doing. And most importantly, we never talk about the great future of our country. We do not talk about any of this stuff anymore. The [NORP] controlled media talks race, race, race for political reasons. And they always have, but never like this. But it is hurting our country, and more than anyone else, our great minority communities. It is hurting them very badly. The [NORP] obsession with race is only dragging us backward into the past, and it is bringing our country down to a point where even [GPE] and [GPE] are lecturing us on human rights, race, and they are doing it in a very humiliating fashion. This never happened. Never happened with me. During my administration, our country was respected again. It is no longer respected. In conclusion, our party and our movement, we are all united by the same shared [NORP] values, and by unyielding resolve to defend our beloved nation for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. We take great pride in our country, and we teach the truth about our history. We celebrate our rich heritage and national traditions. We honor [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], and all of our national heroes. And of course, we always respect our great [NORP] flag. We believe in patriotic education for our children, and we strongly oppose the radical indoctrination of [GPE]'s youth. We are committed to defending innocent life, and to proudly upholding the [NORP] values of our nation's founders. We embrace free thought. We stand up to political correctness, and we reject the intolerance of left wing cancel culture. We believe in our Constitution and in law and order. We want law and order. We demand law and order. We do not want people shot and killed in our cities. We totally respect and support the men and women of law enforcement. They will never be defunded. We are devoted to our communities. We are loyal to our fellow citizens, and above all, we live by the words of our national motto, in God we trust. These are the convictions that define our movement [DATE], and must define [ORG], which has truly become the party of the working man and woman. The working man, the working woman. That is what is happening. Look how many people are joining. We have a much different party than we had [DATE]. You were in big trouble, [NORP], and look what is happening. Now for [DATE], we must pour every ounce of our energy into winning a historic victory in the midterms. We will never give up our search for truth and justice for what happened in the corrupt presidential election of [DATE] because without that truth, we cannot have an honest election in [DATE] or [DATE], no matter what they want to tell you. And our country will soon stand proudly for free and strong and proper elections again. The election fraud of [DATE] is the single most requested topic for me and others to talk about. Ahead of the border, even ahead of crime. Because think of what they have done. What they have done is so sad. Look what is happened to our country in just a short number of months. Everyone here [DATE] and every conservative all across our land needs to decide right now that together we will save this country. We must decide that we will not stop. We will not rest until our [NORP] heritage of freedom, liberty, and justice is once again safe and once again secure. We owe our country nothing less than that. Our glorious [NORP] inheritance was passed down to us by generations of [NORP] patriots who gave everything they had. Their sweat, their blood, and even their way of lives to build [GPE] into the greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are not going to let it be taken away from us by a small group of radical left [NORP] maniacs. We are not going to let it happen. We will protect and defend our cherished [NORP] legacy and freedom for ourselves, for our children, and for every future generation. My fellow [NORP], our movement is the greatest in [NORP] history, and it has just begun. With your help, your devotion, your brilliance, and your drive, we will carry forward the torch of [NORP] liberty. We will lead the conservative movement and [ORG] back to victory, and it will be a greater victory than this party has ever had. We will take back the [ORG]. We will take back the [ORG], and then after witnessing all that has gone wrong in our country in such a short period of time, with our borders, with our economy, with crime, we will take back that glorious [ORG]. That sits so majestically in our nation's capital. Beautiful white house. That is small letters. White house. That beautiful white house. And it is the most beautiful house of all. Working together, we will make [GPE] powerful again. We will make [GPE] wealthy again. We will make [GPE] strong again. We will make [GPE] proud again. We will make [GPE] safe again, and we will make [GPE] great again. Thank you. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}

And as I started [TIME], I made reference to some good advice I got from a encouraging voice that said, Keep it up but not too long. [TIME] I got some equally good advice, To be immortal, you do not need to be eternal. And I will do my best not to be eternally eternal. First point I'd like to make is I am tired. I do not know about you but I am exhausted. And I can only imagine how you feel, but I am also very deeply grateful for just how you have attended to these presentations and discussions over [DATE]. I am deeply grateful. I can tell how much consideration you have given to our point of view and the president's point of view and that is all we can ask. At the end of the day, all we can ask is that you hear us out and make the best judgment that you can consistent with your conscience and our constitution. Now, I wanted to start out [TIME] with where we began when we first appeared before you [DATE], and that is with the resolution itself. With what the president is charged with in the articles and how that holds up now that you have heard the evidence from the house. [PERSON] was impeached in article [CARDINAL] for abuse of power. And that article provides that in his conduct of the Office of President of [GPE] and in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the Office of President of [GPE] and to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of [GPE], and is in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. [PERSON] has abused the powers of his presidency in that using the powers of his high office, President [PERSON] solicited the interference of a foreign government, [GPE], in the [DATE] [GPE] presidential election. President [PERSON] solicited the interference of a foreign government, [GPE], in the [DATE] election. That has been proved. He did so through a scheme or course of conduct that included soliciting the government of [GPE] to publicly announce investigations that would benefit his reelection, harm the election prospects of a political opponent, and influence [DATE] [GPE] presidential election to his advantage. That has been proved. President [PERSON] also sought to pressure the government of [GPE] to take these steps by conditioning official [GPE] government acts of significant value to [GPE] on its public announcement of the investigations. That has been proved. President [PERSON] engaged in the scheme or course of conduct for corrupt purposes in pursuit of personal political benefit. That has been proved. In doing so, President [PERSON] used the power of the presidency in a manner that compromised the national security of [GPE] and undermined the integrity of the [GPE] democratic process. That has been proved. He thus ignored and injured the interests of the nation. That has been proved. President [PERSON] engaged in the scheme or course of conduct through the following means. President [PERSON] acting both directly and through his agents within and outside the [GPE] government corruptly solicited the government of [GPE] to publicly announce investigations into, A, a political opponent, Former Vice President, [PERSON] That has been proved. A discredited theory promoted by [GPE] alleging that [GPE] rather than [GPE] interfered in the [DATE] [GPE] presidential election. That has been proved. With the same corrupt motives, President [PERSON] acting both directly and through his agents within and outside the [GPE] government conditioned to official acts on the public announcements that he had requested the release of [MONEY] of [GPE] taxpayer funds that [ORG] had appropriated on a bipartisan basis for the purpose of providing vital military and security assistance to [GPE] to oppose [NORP] aggression and which President [PERSON] had ordered suspended. That has been proved. And B, a head of state meeting at [FAC], which the president of [GPE] sought to demonstrate continued [GPE] support for the government of [GPE] in the face of [NORP] aggression. That has been proved. Faced with public revelation of his actions, President [PERSON] ultimately released the military and security assistance to the government of [GPE], but has persisted in openly and corruptly urging and soliciting [GPE] to undertake investigations for his personal political benefit. That has been proved. These actions were consistent with President [PERSON]'s previous invitations of foreign interference in [GPE] elections. That has been proved. In all of this, President [PERSON] abused the powers of the presidency by ignoring and injuring national security and other vital national interests to obtain an improper personal political benefit. That has been proved. He also betrayed the nation by abusing his high office to enlist a foreign power in corrupting democratic elections. That has been proved. Wherefore, President [PERSON] by such conduct has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security and the constitution if allowed to remain in office and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self governments and the rule of law. That has been proved. President [PERSON] thus warrants impeachment and trial removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under [GPE]. That will be for you to decide. But the facts have been proved. Those facts are not contested. We have met our burden. Article two, obstruction of [ORG]. The constitution provides that [ORG] shall have the sole power of impeachment and the president shall be removed from office on impeachment for and conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. In his conduct of [ORG], in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the Office of President United States and to the best of his ability preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of [GPE] and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, [PERSON] has directed the unprecedented categorical and indiscriminate defiance of subpoenas issued by [ORG] pursuant to its sole power of impeachment. That has been proved. President [PERSON] has abused the powers of the presidency in a manner offensive to and subversive of the constitution in that [ORG] has engaged in an impeachment inquiry focused on President [PERSON]'s corrupt solicitation of the government of [GPE] to interfere in the [DATE] [GPE] presidential election. That has been proved. As part of this impeachment inquiry, the committee's undertaking the investigation served subpoenas seeking documents and testimony deemed vital to the inquiry for various executive branch agencies and offices and current and former officials. That has been proved. In response without lawful cause or excuse, President [PERSON] directed executive branch agencies, offices and officials not to comply with those subpoenas. That has been proved. President [PERSON] thus interpose the powers of the presidency against the lawful subpoenas of [ORG] and assume to himself functions and judgements necessary to exercise the sole power of impeachment vested in the constitution in [ORG]. That has been proved. President [PERSON] abused the powers of his high office through the following means. Number [CARDINAL], directing [ORG] to defy a lawful subpoena by withholding the production of documents sought therein by the committees. That has been proved. Directing other executive branch agencies and offices to defy lawful subpoenas and withhold the production of documents and records from the committees in response to which [ORG], [ORG], [ORG] and [ORG] refused to produce a single record or document. That has been proved. Direct and current and former executive branch officials not to cooperate with the committees in response to which [CARDINAL] administration officials defied subpoenas for testimony namely [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON] and [PERSON]. That has been proved. These actions were consistent with President [PERSON]'s previous efforts to undermine [GPE] government investigations into foreign interference in [GPE] elections. That has been proved. Through these actions, President [PERSON] sought to arrogate himself the right to determine the propriety scope and nature of an impeachment inquiry into his own conduct, as well as the unilateral prerogative to deny any and all information to [ORG] in the exercise of its sole power of impeachment. That has been proved. In the history of the Republic, no president has ever ordered the complete defiance of an impeachment inquiry or sought to obstruct and impede so comprehensively the ability of [ORG] to investigate high crimes and misdemeanors. That has been proved. The abuse of office serve to cover up the president's own repeated misconduct and to seize and control the power of impeachment and thus to nullify a vital safeguard vested solely in [ORG]. That has been proved. In all of this, President [PERSON] has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as president and subversive of constitutional government to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of [GPE]. That has been proved. Whereas or wherefore, President [PERSON] by such conduct has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to the constitution if allowed to remain in office and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self government and the rule of law. That has been proved. President [PERSON] thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under [GPE]. That will be for you to determine. Let me say something about this second article. The facts of the president's defiance of [ORG] are very simple because they were so uniform. Because they were so categorical. Because they are so uncontested, but too do not mistake for a moment the fact that it was simple and easy and quick to present that course of conduct compared with a sophisticated campaign to coerce [GPE] into thinking that that second article is any less significant than the first. Do not believe that for a moment. If there is no article [CARDINAL], let me tell you something, there will never be an article [CARDINAL]. If there is no article [CARDINAL], there will never of any kind or shape or form be an article [CARDINAL]. And why is that? Because if you and we lack the power to investigate a president, there will never be an article [CARDINAL]. Whether that article [CARDINAL] is abuse of power or that article [CARDINAL] is treason or that article [CARDINAL] is bribery, there will never be an article [CARDINAL] if the [ORG] cannot investigate an impeachable offense. If the [ORG] cannot because the president prevents it investigate the president's own wrongdoing, there will never be an article [CARDINAL] because there will be no more impeachment power. It will be gone. It will be gone. As I said before, our relationship with [GPE] will survive. God willing, our relationship with [GPE] will survive and [GPE] will prosper and we will get beyond this ugly chapter of our history. But if we are to decide here that a president of [GPE] can simply say under article [CARDINAL], I can do whatever I want and I do not have to treat a coequal branch of government like it exists. I do not have to give it any more than the back of my hand. That will be an unending injury to this country. [GPE] will survive and so will we, but that will be an unending injury to this country because the balance of power that our founders set out will never be the same. Will never be the same. If a president can simply say, I am going to fight all subpoenas, and I will tell you something else. Truism in the courts is just as true here in the [ORG] where they say justice delayed is justice denied. You give this president or any other the unilateral power to delay as long as he or she likes, to litigate matters for [DATE] and [DATE] in the courts and do not fool yourself into thinking it is anything less. In [DATE], it will be [DATE] since we subpoenaed [PERSON] and there is no sign of an end to that case. I will tell you, when it gets to [ORG], you might think that is the end and that is just the end of the first chapter because [PERSON] is in court saying, I am absolutely immune from testimony. Now that is been rejected by every court that is looked at it. But we will see what [ORG] says and then we will see if it goes to [ORG]. And then we will see what [ORG] says. And when we prevail on [ORG], you know what happens? That is not the end of the matter. It comes back to the trial court and then Well, they cannot claim absolute immunity more. They cannot claim that We do not even have to bother showing up. So now we are going to turn to plan B, executive privilege. We are going to say we cannot and will not answer any of the questions that are really pertinent to your impeachment inquiry. And let us start out in district court and then go to [ORG] and then go en banc and then go to [ORG]. You can game the system for [DATE]. Justice delayed is justice denied and so is true about presidential accountability. So when you suggest or I suggest or anyone suggests or [ORG] suggest, why does not the [ORG], why did not the house just exhaust their remedies as if in the constitution where it says, The house shall have the sole power of impeachment. There is an asterisk that says, After exhausting all court remedies and for seeking court in the district court and then seeking relief in the court of appeals and after that, go in [ORG]. Let us not kid ourselves about what that really means. What that really means is you allow the president to control the timing of his own impeachment or if it will ever be permitted to come before this body. That is not an impeachment power. That is the absence of an impeachment power. Article two is every bit as important as article [CARDINAL]. Without article two, there is no article [CARDINAL] ever again. No matter how egregious this president's conduct or any other, it is fundamental to the separation of powers. If you cannot have the ability to enforce an impeachment power, you might as well not put it in the constitution. Now, shortly, the president's lawyers will have a chance to make their presentation and as we will not have the ability to respond to what they say, I want to give you a little preview of what I think they are going to have in store for you so that when you do hear it, you can put it into some perspective. I expect that they will attack the process. I do not think that is any mystery, but I want to tell you both what I expect they will share it with you and what it really means. When you cut through all the chaff, what does it really mean that they are saying? So here is what I expect that they will tell you. The process was so unfair. It was the most unfair in the history of the world. Because of the [ORG], they took depositions. How dare they take depositions? How dare they listen to [PERSON]? How dare they follow the [NORP] procedures that preceded their investigation? How dare they? And they were so secret in the bunker, in the basement, as if whether it is on the ground floor of the basement of the first floor makes any difference. Those super secret depositions in which [CARDINAL] members of [ORG] equivalent to the entire [ORG] could participate. That is how secret they were. That is how exclusive they were. Every [NORP], every [NORP] on [CARDINAL] committees could participate. Of course, that was not enough so you had even more storm the [ORG]. Right? So you have [CARDINAL] people can participate, but you heard earlier, but the [NORP] were not allowed to participate. Okay. That is just false. You know how we did it in those super secret depositions and you could look this up yourself because we released the transcripts. We got [TIME]. They got [TIME]. We got [TIME]. They got [TIME]. And we did that back and forth until everyone was done asking their questions. Now, you will hear, Oh, [SPEAKER] was so unfair. He would not allow us to ask our questions. Well, there were certain questions I did not allow. Questions like, who is the whistle blower? Because we want to punish that whistle blower. Because yes, some of us in this house and in this house believe we ought to protect whistle blowers. So yes, I did not allow the outing of the whistle blower. So when they say the chairman would not allow certain questions, that is what they mean. That means that we protect people who have the courage to come forward and blow the whistle. That we do not think, though the president might, that they are traitors and spiced. To believe that someone who blows the whistle on misconduct of the serious nature that you now know took place is a traitor or a spy. There is [CARDINAL] way you can come to that conclusion. And that is if you believe you are the state and that anything that contradicts you is treason. That is the only way that you can conceive of someone who exposes wrongdoing is a trader or a spy. But that is exactly how this president views those who expose his wrongdoing because he is the state. Like any good Monarch, he is the state. And you will hear, The president was not allowed to participate in the judiciary committee. Well, that is false too as you have heard. The president had the same rights in our proceedings as President [PERSON] and President [PERSON]. But nonetheless, you will hear, It was so unfair. And [CARDINAL] other thing that was really unfair is all the subpoenas were invalid because the [ORG] did not pass a resolution announcing its impeachment inquiry. Never mind that we actually did. The problem was they said, Well, we had not , and then we did. And then the problem was, Well, you did. Well, of course, as you know, the constitution says the [ORG] will have the sole power of impeachment. If we want to do it by [ORG] resolution, we can do it by [ORG] resolution. If we want to do it by [ORG] resolution, we can do it by [ORG] resolution. If we want to do it by committee, we can do it by committee. It is not the President's place to tell us how to conduct an impeachment proceeding any more than it is the President's place to tell you how you should try it. When you see that [CARDINAL]-page diatribe from the [ORG] council saying, We should have been able to have a resolution in the [ORG], or, We should have been able to have this, what you should hear, what they really mean is, [PERSON] had the right to control his own impeachment proceeding, and it is an outrage that [PERSON] did not get to write the rules of his own impeachment proceeding in the [ORG]. You give a president that right, there is no impeachment power. When you hear them say that, when you hear them complain about depositions that were the same as the [NORP], or the right to participate, that was the same in [PERSON] and [PERSON]. By the way, they were not allowed to call witnesses, they said. [CARDINAL] of the [CARDINAL] witnesses that we heard at our open hearings were the minority witness requests. You will hear those arguments, the most unfair and history. The fact is we had the same process. In those other impeachments, the majority did not surrender its subpoena power to the minority. You know what it did? It said, You can subpoena witnesses, and if the majority does not agree you can force a vote. That is the same process we had here. The majority does not surrender its subpoena power. Did not in the prior impeachments, did not in this one. When they say the process was unfair, what they are really mean is do not look at what the President did. For God's sake, do not look at what the President did. Now, you will also hear, I think the second thing you will hear from the President's team is, Attack the managers. Those managers are just awful. They are terrible people. Especially that [SPEAKER] guy. He is the worst. He is the worst. Exhibit A, he mocked the President. He mocked the President. He mocked the President as if he was shaking down a leader of another country, like he was an organized crime figure. He mocked the President. He said it was like the President said, 'Listen, [PERSON], because I am only going to say this [CARDINAL] times.' I discovered something very significant by mocking the President. That is, for a man who loves to mock others, he does not like to be mocked. Turns out, he is got a pretty thin skin. Who would've thought it? Nevermind that I said I was not using his words before I said it, and I was not using his words after I said it, and I said I was making a parody of his words. It is an outrage. He mocked the President. That [SPEAKER], terrible. Now, they will attack my other colleagues too, for things said in the heat of debate here on the floor as we were reaching [TIME]. They will attack some of my colleagues who are not even in this chamber. Maybe they will attack the squad. That is a perennial favorite with the President. If they attack the squad you should ask, What does that have to do with the price of beans? You can expect a tax on all kinds of members of the [ORG] that have nothing to do with the issues before you. When you hear those attacks you should ask yourself, Away from what do they want to distract my attention? [CARDINAL] times out of [CARDINAL] it will be the President's misconduct, but look for it. Attacks on the managers, attacks on other [ORG] members, attacks on the speaker, attacks on who knows what. It is all of the same ilk. Whatever you do, just do not consider the President's misconduct. You will also hear attacks on the constitution. Of course, it will not be framed as an attack on the constitution, but that is really what it represents. That is, abusive power does not violate the constitution. Presidents of [GPE] have every right to abuse their power. That is the argument. Okay, I know it is a hard argument to make, right? Presidents have a constitutional right to abuse their power, and how dare [ORG] charge a president with abusing his power. Now, I am looking forward to that constitutional argument by [PERSON], because I want to know why abusing power and trust is not impeachable now, but it was [DATE]. The last time I checked, I do not think there was a significant change to the constitution between the time he said it was impeachable, and the time he is saying now that apparently it is not impeachable. I am looking forward to that argument, but I am also looking forward to [PERSON] presentation. During the [PERSON] impeachment, he maintained that a president not only could, but must be impeached for obstructing justice. That [PERSON] needed to be impeached because he lied under oath about sex, and to do so obstructed justice. You can be impeached for obstructing justice, but you cannot be impeached for obstructing [ORG]. Now, I have to confess, I do not know exactly how that is supposed to work. The logical conclusion from that is, [PERSON] saying that [PERSON] mistake was in showing up under subpoena. That [PERSON] mistake was not saying, I am going to fight all subpoenas. That [PERSON] mistake was in not taking the position that under Article Two, he could do whatever he wanted. Does that really make any sense? You can be impeached for obstructing your own branch of government, but you cannot be impeached for obstructing a co-equal branch of government. That would make no sense to the framers. I have to think, over [DATE] as they have watched us, they would be astonished that anyone would take that argument seriously, or could so misapprehend how this balance of power is supposed to work. I look forward to that art argument. Maybe when they make that argument they can explain to us why their position on abusive power is not even supported by their own attorney general. I hope they will answer why even their own attorney general does not agree with them. Not to mention, by the way, the constitutional law expert called by the [NORP] in the [ORG] who also testified as to abuse of power, that it is impeachable. That you do not need a crime that is impeachable. Now, when you hear them make these arguments, cannot be impeached for abusing your power, this is what it really means. We cannot defend his conduct, and so we want to make it go all away without even having to think about that. You do not even need to think about what the President did, because the [ORG] charged it wrong. So, do not even consider what the President did. That is what that argument means. We cannot defend the indefensible, so we have to fall back on, even if he abused his office, even if he did all the things he is accused of, that is perfectly fine. There is nothing that can be done about it. Now, you will also hear, as part of the defense, and you heard this from [PERSON], was I think the last thing he said, The whistleblower, and then he stepped back to the table. The whistleblower. Now, I do not really know what that meant, but I suspect you will hear more of that. The whistleblower. The whistleblower. It is his, or her fault that we are here. The whistleblower. I would encourage you to read the whistleblower complaint again. When you read that complaint again, you will see just how remarkably accurate it is. It is astonishingly accurate. For all the times the President is out there saying that the complaint was all wrong, It was all wrong, you read it, now that you have heard the evidence, you read it and you will see how remarkably right the whistleblower got it. Now, when that complaint was filed, it was obviously before we had our depositions, and had our hearings. All of which obviated the need for the whistleblower. In the beginning we wanted the whistleblower to come and testify, because all we knew about was the complaint. Then, we were able to hear from firsthand witnesses about what happened, and then something else happened. the President and his allies began threatening the whistleblower, and the life of the whistleblower was at risk. What was the point in exposing that whistleblower to the risk of his, or her life when we had the evidence we needed? What was the point, except retribution. Retribution, and the President wants it still. You know why the President is mad at the whistleblower? Because, but for the whistleblower, he would not have been caught, and that is an unforgivable sin. He is the [ORG] and but for the whistleblower, the President would not have been caught. For that, he is a spy and he is guilty of treason. Now, what does he add to this? Nothing, but retribution. [QUANTITY]. You will also hear the President's defense, They hate the President. They hate the President. You should not consider the presence misconduct because they hate the President. Now, what I have said, I leave you to your own judgments about the President. I only hate what he is done to this country. I grieve for what he is done to this country. When they make the argument to you that this is only happening because they hate the President, it is just another of the myriad forms of, please do not consider what the President did. Whether you like the President, or you dislike the President is immaterial. It is all about the constitution, and his misconduct. If it meets the standard of impeachable conduct as we approved, it does not matter what you like him. It does not matter what you dislike him. What matters is whether he is a danger to the country, because he will do it again. None of us can have confidence, based on his record, that he will not do it again because he is telling us [DATE] that he will. Now, you will hear the further defense that [PERSON] is corrupt. That [PERSON] is corrupt, that [PERSON] is corrupt. This is their defense. This'll be another defense, because what they hope to achieve in the [ORG] trial is what they could not achieve through their scheme. If they could not get [GPE] to smear the [PERSON], they want to use this trial to do it instead. Let us call [PERSON]. Let us smear the [PERSON]. Let us succeed in the trial with what we could not do with this scheme. That is the goal. Now, I do not know whether [PERSON], who said he was going to present his report to some of the senators has presented his report. Maybe he has. Maybe you will get to see what is in [PERSON] report. Maybe you will get to see some documents smearing the [PERSON] produced by who knows. Maybe these same [NORP] corrupt former prosecutors. Make no mistake about what that is about. It is about completing the object of the scheme through other means, through the means of this trial. You may hear the argument that what the President is doing when he is obstructing [ORG] is protecting the office for future presidents, because there is nothing more important to [PERSON] than protecting the office of the presidency for future presidents. I supposed, when he withheld military aid from [GPE] he was trying to protect future presidents. When he sought to coerce a foreign power to intervene in our election, he was doing it on behalf of future presidents, because future presidents might likewise wish to cheat in a further election. I do not think that argument goes very far, but I expect you will hear it. I expect you will hear it. You may hear an argument that the President was really concerned about corruption, and he was concerned about burden sharing. I will not spend much time on that because you have heard the evidence on that. There is no indication that this had anything to do with corruption in every, every bit of evidence that it had nothing to do with fighting corruption, or burden sharing. Indeed, nothing about the burden changed between the time he froze the aide and the time he released the aid. There was no new effort to get others to contribute more, and Europe contributes a great deal as it is. This is an after-the-fact rationalization. You probably saw the public reporting that there was an exhaustive effort after the fact to come up with a post-talk rationalization for this scheme. I would like to show you the product of that investigation, but I will need your help because it is among the documents they refuse to turn over. They will show you just what an after- the-fact invention this argument is. Now, I expect you will hear the argument, [PERSON] did it. [PERSON] did it. Now, that may take several different forms, but the form of [PERSON] did it that I am referring to is, [PERSON] also withheld aid. Honestly, I think that argument is an insult to our intelligence because the argument is, [PERSON] withheld aid from [GPE], and he made a condition with it. [PERSON] withheld aid from [GPE] after they had a revolution, and circumstances change. You know something? He did not hide it from [ORG]. In fact, [ORG] supported it. Yes, there are times when we withhold aid for a good policy reason. Not a corrupt effort to get help in your election. The [NORP] people know the difference between right and wrong. They can recognize the difference between aid that is withheld for a malicious purpose, and aid that is held in the best interest of our national security. But, you will hear the [PERSON] did it argument. You will hear the call was perfect. You will hear the call was perfect. Now, I suspect the reason they will make the argument the call was perfect is because the President insists that they do. I do not think they really want to have to make that argument. You would not either, but they have a client to represent and so they will make the argument, the call was perfect. They will also make the argument, [GPE] thinks the call was perfect. [GPE] says there was no pressure. What that really means is [GPE] wants a future, [GPE] knows it is still beholden to us for aid, [GPE] still has not gotten in through the door of [ORG]. [GPE] knows that if they acknowledge that they were shaken down by the President of [GPE], the President [GPE] will make them pay. When you hear them say, [GPE] felt no pressure and their proof is because the [GPE] president does not want to call the President [GPE] a bad name, you will know why. Because they need [GPE]. They need [GPE]. The framers did not expect you to leave your common sense at the door. Now, you will also hear the defense, the President said there was no quid pro quo. the President said there was no quid pro quo. I guess that is the end of the story. This is a well-known principle of criminal law, that if the defendant says he did not do it, he could not have done it. If the defendant learns that he is been caught and he says he did not do it, he could not have done it. That does not hold up in any court in the land. It should not hold up here. You also hear a variation of the argument, No harm, no foul. They got the money. They got the money, and they got the meeting even though they did not . They got the meeting on the sideline of the [ORG]. It was kind of a drive by, but they got a meeting. No harm, no foul, right? A meeting on the sidelines is pretty much the same thing, right? As a head of state meeting in [FAC]? of course it is not. Why do you think at that meeting at [ORG], the President of [GPE] was still saying, Hey, when am I going to get to come to town? He certainly recognizes the difference, and we should too. What is more, there is every bit of harm, every bit of foul in withholding aid from an ally at war, and releasing it only when you are caught. [GPE] knows now about the wedge in our relations with [GPE]. The moment [GPE] found out about this, and I have to imagine, given how good their intel services are they did not have to wait for [ORG] to break the story any more than [GPE] did. In fact, there is so deep a penetration of [GPE]. I would have to expect the [NORP] would have found out at least as early as the [NORP] did, if not earlier. The moment [GPE] learned, and [GPE] learned, there was harm because [GPE] knew they could not trust us, [GPE] knew they could take advantage of us. There was immediate harm. Because someone is caught, because a scheme is thwarted, does not make that scheme any less criminal, and corrupt. You get no pass when you get caught. I expect one of the defenses you will see is, they will play you certain testimony from the [ORG] where my colleagues on the other side of the aisle ask questions like, Did the President ever say he was bribing [GPE]? Did you ever see him actually bribe [GPE]? Did you hear him say that he was going to bribe [GPE]? Did you personally see this yourself? If you did not see it, if he did not lay it out for you, then it could not have happened. [CARDINAL] plus [CARDINAL] does not equal [CARDINAL]. You are not allowed to consider anything except for a televised You are not allowed to consider anything except for a televised confession by the president, and even then, do not consider it. So, I imagine you will hear some of that testimony where witnesses are asked, they work for the defense department. Well, did the president ever tell you that he was conditioning the aid? Nevermind that these are people, do not necessarily even talk to the president, but I will expect you will see some of that. As I mentioned before, you will hear the defense, we claim privilege. You cannot impeach the president over the exercise of privilege. Nevermind the fact that they never claimed privilege. They never asserted privilege. And you know why? You know why they never actually invoked privilege in the house? Is because they know that if they did, they'd have to produce the documents and they'd have to show what they were redacting and they did not want to do even that. They knew the overwhelming majority of the documents and witness testimony, there was no even colorable claim of privilege. So, they did not want to even invoke it. All they would say is maybe someday. But you will hear that you cannot be impeached for a claim of privilege they never made. So, what do all these defenses mean? What do they mean? What do they mean collectively when you add them all up? What they mean is under Article Two, the president can do whatever he wants. That is really it. That is really it, stripped of all the detail and all the histrionics. What they want us to believe is the president can do whatever he wants under Article Two and there is nothing that you or the [ORG] can do about it. [PERSON] once said, Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle or great intelligence. Yet it is the [CARDINAL] essential vital quality for those who seek to change the world which yields most painfully to change. Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle. I have to say, when I first read that, I was not sure I agreed. Moral courage is a rarer quality than courage in battle, that just does not seem right. I was not sure I really agreed and for a [NORP] not to agree with a [PERSON] is kind of a heresy. I am sure some of my [ORG] colleagues feel the same way about the [PERSON]'s from [GPE]. After all, what could be more brave than courage in battle? What could be more rare than courage in battle? But then, I got to visit, as I know all of you have, our service members around the world and see just how blessed we are with an abundance of heroes by [CARDINAL] who have joined the service of this country. Service members who [DATE] demonstrate the most incredible bravery. I just have the greatest respect for them, for people like [PERSON] and [PERSON] and [PERSON] and so many others who've served in this body and the other or who've never served in office. By [CARDINAL] all around the country and all around the world. Most incredible respect. It is an amazing thing how common is their uncommon bravery. My father is [DATE], he is probably watching. He is part of the greatest generation, left high school early to join the service. He tried to enlist in [ORG] and he failed the physical. So, at the end of World War II, failed the physical. Bad eyesight and flat feet, which was apparently enough to fail the physical. So, [DATE] he went to try to enlist in the [ORG], thinking that maybe it is a different physical standard and even if it is not , maybe I will get a different examining physician. Turns out, same standard, same physician. He recognized my father and he said, Were not you here [DATE]? And my father said, Yeah. He said, You really want to get in that bad? My father said, Yeah. And he was in the [ORG]. Now the war was over and so he never left [GPE]. When he left the service, he went to [ORG] and about midway through he wanted to get on with his life and he left college and went out into the business world, something he always regretted, leaving college early. I think in many ways, he got a better education than I did. I think that I was lucky to get a good education, but I think those like [PERSON] and others who served in the military and also went to school, got the best education, because I think there is certain things you can only learn by being in the military. Certainly, you cannot really learn, I think, about war without going to war and maybe there are things you just cannot learn about life without going to war. So, those of you that have served have the most complete education I think there is. Even so, is moral courage really more rare than that on the battlefield? Then I saw what [PERSON] meant by moral courage. Few, he said, are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows, the censure of their colleagues and the wrath of their society. Then I understood by that measure just how rare moral courage is. How many of us are willing to brave the disapproval of our fellows, the censure of our colleagues and the wrath of our society? Just as those who have served in uniform cannot fully understand, those who have not served in uniform cannot fully understand what military service means. So to there is a different kind of fraternity or sorority among those who have served in office. I always tell my constituents there are [CARDINAL] kinds of jobs in congress and it is not [NORP] and [NORP]. It is those from a safe seat and those from an unsafe seat. I am sure the same is true of those from a safe state and an unsafe state. It is why I think there is a certain chemistry between members who represent those swing districts and states, because they can step into each others shoes. [CARDINAL] of the things that we in this fellowship of office holders understand that most people do not is that real political courage does not come from disagreeing with our opponents but from disagreeing with our friends and with our own party, because it means having to stare down accusations of disloyalty and betrayal. He is a [NORP] name only or she is a [NORP] in name only. What I said [TIME], if it resonated with anyone in this chamber, did not require courage. My views, as heartfelt as they are, reflect the views of my constituents. But what happens when our heartfelt views of right and wrong are in conflict with the popular opinion of our constituents? What happens when our devotion to our oaths, to our values, to our love of country, depart from the momentary passion of a large number of people back home? Those are the times that try our souls. [ORG] news reported [TIME] that a [PERSON] confidante said that [ORG] senators were warned, Vote against your president, vote against the president and your head will be on a pike. Now, I do not know if that is true. Vote against the president and your head will be on a pike. I have to say, when I read that, and again, I do not know if that is true, but when I read that I was struck by the irony. I hope it is not true. I hope it is not true. But I was struck by the irony of the idea when we are talking about a president who would make himself a monarch, that whoever that was would use the terminology of a penalty that was opposed by a monarch. A head on a pike. [DATE], [GPE] lost a hero, [PERSON]. He passed away on [DATE], [DATE] before this trial began. Some of you may have known or even served with congressman [PERSON], he was a [NORP] from [GPE] and a second ranking member on the house judiciary committee when that committee was conducting its impeachment inquiry into President [PERSON]. In [DATE] as the inquiry was coming to a close Congressman [PERSON] began meeting with a bipartisan group of members of the house, [CARDINAL] other [NORP] and [CARDINAL] [NORP]. Here in the [ORG], they might have called them the gang of [CARDINAL]. They gathered and they talked and they labored over language and ultimately helped develop a bipartisan support for the articles that led a group of [NORP] Senators, including [PERSON] and [PERSON], to tell President [PERSON] that he must resign. Some say that the [PERSON] impeachment might not have moved forward were it not for those [CARDINAL] courageous [NORP] led by Congressman [PERSON] and it pained the congressman because he credited [PERSON] with giving him his seat, with getting him elected. He did it because he said, Because seeing all the evidence, it was something we had to do because the evidence was there. [CARDINAL] of his aids, [PERSON], eulogized him saying, He felt an obligation to the constitution to do what is right. Now soon, members of this body will face the most momentous of decisions. Not as I said at the outset, between guilt and innocence, but a far more foundational issue. Should there be a fair trial? Shall the [ORG] be able to present its case with witnesses and documents through the use of subpoenas as has been case in every impeachment trial in history? Now the president's lawyers have been their case outside of this chamber, threatening to stall these proceedings with the assertion of false claims of privilege. Having persuaded this body to postpone consideration of the witnesses and documents, they now appear to be preparing the ground to say it will be too late to consider them [DATE]. Consider this, of the [CARDINAL] of documents that we have subpoenaed, there is no colorable claim and none has been asserted. To the degree that you can even make a claim, that claim has been waived. To the degree that even superficially a claim would attach, it does not conceal misconduct. What is more, to the degree that there were a dispute over whether a privilege applied, we have a perfectly good judge sitting behind me, empowered by the rules of this body to resolve those disputes. When the Chief Justice decides, where a narrow application of privilege ought to apply, you will still have the power to overrule him. How often do you get the chance to overrule a Chief Justice of [ORG]? You have to admit, it is every legislators dream. So, let us not be fooled by the argument that it will take too long or persuaded that the trial must be over before the State of the Union. This is no parking ticket we are contesting, no shoplifting case we are prosecuting. It is a matter of high crimes and misdemeanors. How long is too long to have a fair trial? Fair to the president and fair to the [NORP] people. The [NORP] people do not agree on much, but they will not forgive being deprived of the truth and certainly not because it took a backseat to expediency. In his pamphlet of [DATE], The American Crisis, [PERSON] wrote, Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must undergo the fatigue of supporting it. Is it too much fatigue to call witnesses and have a fair trial? Are the blessings of freedom so meager that we will not endure the fatigue of a real trial with witnesses and documents. President [PERSON] in his closing message to [ORG] in [DATE] said this, Fellow citizens we cannot escape history. We of this [ORG] and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance or insignificance can spare [CARDINAL] or another of us the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation. I think he was the most interesting president in history. He may be the most interesting person in our history. This man who started out dirt poor, dirt poor like [CARDINAL] of other people at the time, he had nothing. No money, no education, he educated himself. Educate himself, but he had a brain in that head, a brilliance in that mind, that made him one of the most incredible, not just presidents, but people in history. I think he is the most interesting character in our history. Out of the [CARDINAL] of other [NORP] at the time, why him? Why him? I think a lot about history, as I know you do. Sometimes I think about how unforgiving history can be of our conduct. We can do a lifetimes work, draft the most wonderful legislation, help our constituents and yet we may be remembered for none of that, but for a single decision, we may be remembered, effecting the course of our country. I believe this may be one of those moments. A moment we never thought we would see. A moment when our democracy was gravely threatened and not from without but from within. [GPE] too has a constitution. It is not a bad constitution, it is just a meaningless one. In [GPE], they have trial by telephone. They have the same ostensible rights we do to a trial, they hear evidence and witnesses, but before the verdict is rendered, the judge picks up the telephone and calls the right person to find out how it is supposed to turn out. Trial by telephone. Is that what we have here, trial by telephone? Someone on the other end of the phone dictating what this trial should look like. The founders gave us more than words. They gave us inspiration. They may have receded into mythology but they inspire us still and more than us, they inspire the rest of the world. They inspire the rest of the world. From their prison cells in [GPE], journalists look to us. From their internment camps in [GPE], they look to us. From their cells in [GPE], those who gathered in [FAC] for a better life, look to us. From the [GPE], those that were the victims and their families of mass extrajudicial killing, they look to us. From [GPE] prison, they look to us. From all over the world, they look to us. Increasingly, they do not recognize what they see. It is a terrible tragedy for them, it is a worst tragedy for us, because there is no where else for them to turn. They are not going to turn to [GPE], they are not going to turn to [GPE], they are not going to turn to Europe with all of its problems. They look to us because we are still the indispensable nation. They look to us because we have a rule of law. They look to us because no one is above that law. One of the things that separates us from those people in [FAC] is the right to a trial. It is a right to a trial. [NORP] get a fair trial. So I ask you, I implore you, give [GPE] a fair trial. Give [GPE] a fair trial. She is worth it. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsjoebidennorthcarolinaspeechtranscriptoctober18", "text": "I tell you what. Thanks for sharing your story and it is what this country's all about. You are making your family proud, man. And I wanted to talk, I want to thank the speakers ahead of me. Commissioner, soon to be commissioner [PERSON], where are you [PERSON]? I know you are here somewhere. And also state Representative [PERSON], [PERSON]. She is here. [PERSON]. Folks, and a great coach, Coach [PERSON]. I tell you what. My granddaughter's with me [DATE]. And she went to a school that Coach [PERSON] went to for a little while in [GPE]. And apparently Coach telling me she is recruiting some of the girl's basketball team from where my granddaughter went to school. And she showed me [PERSON], she showed me a video you were doing for your team, where you made the distinction between competing and winning, the heart of winning and competing. And you talked about, though, working hard and competing. And everybody you pointed out works hard. But you said working hard is absolutely essential, but competing is even more consequential. You can work hard, but did you compete with everything you had? Competing because you know what is at stake, what is at the heart of winning. My good friends, Congressman, excuse me, [PERSON] and [PERSON], who represent the first and fourth districts with decency and honor, they can tell you we are doing both, working hard and we are competing like we never did before because so much is at stake for this nation. The very soul of the nation is at stake. Folks, as my coaches used to say in college, it is go time. It is the most important election in our lifetimes. We are going to make all the difference here in [GPE]. The choice is clear as it is ever been. And the stakes have never been higher. The stakes of this election, remind me of something my dad used to say when he lost job up in [GPE], [GPE] when I was a kid, when coal died and he moved down to [GPE]. He used to always say, [PERSON], a job is about a lot more than a paycheck.- It is about your dignity. It is about respect. It is about your place in the community. Then he said, it is the God's truth, if I heard it once I heard it [CARDINAL] times. It is about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, Honey, it is going to be okay. That is a lesson I have never forgotten. When I grew up surrounded by a lot of hard work and folks in [GPE], [GPE] and [GPE], [GPE] were we moved. How many people [DATE] though, think they can look their kid in the eye right now and say, It is going to be okay, and mean it. So many people are hurting. [CARDINAL] the people in [GPE] say if they got a bill for $[MONEY] they did not expect in [DATE], they would not be able to pay it. They'd have to borrow the money or they'd have to sell something. Folks, times are hard, unemployment's way up. [DATE], [CARDINAL], 000 people filed for unemployment. Folks are worried about making their next mortgage payment or rent payment. Whether their healthcare will be ripped away in the middle of a pandemic. Worried about sending their kids to school, worried about not sending their kids to school. They see folks at the top, they are doing better than ever while they are left to wonder, Who is looking out for me. Well, that is [PERSON] presidency. [CARDINAL], 000 [NORP] dead because of COVID-19. [CARDINAL] here in the state of [GPE]. On [DATE], we saw the highest number of new cases in [DATE] since [DATE]. In [DATE], worst day since [DATE]. Yet, [TIME] [PERSON] said in [CARDINAL] of his rallies, We have turned the corner. And my grandfather would say, This guy's gone around the bend if he thinks we turned the corner, Turn the corner? Things are getting worse. He continues to lie to us about the circumstances. Experts say we are likely to lose [CARDINAL], 000 additional lives nationwide [DATE]. All because this President cares more about his [FAC] perspective on the world, the stock market, than he does about you. Because he refuses to follow the science. It is estimated that if we just wore masks, if we just wore masks, we'd save [DATE], [CARDINAL] lives. His own head of the [ORG] said that. And you know what? What is really sad about this? The President knew how dangerous this virus was all the way back in [DATE]. And he hid it from the country. He is on record. He told [PERSON] in a taped interview that the disease was deadly, much worse than the flu. And here is what he did. According to [ORG] [DATE], his Administration gave Wall Street investors, a head's up, but he did not tell us, just his friends on Wall Street. That is why they made so much money by selling short. Well who got sold short, y'all got sell short. And you know what is coming. But what happened to the rest of us? He tried to claim with [PERSON], he did not want to panic the [NORP] people. The [NORP] people do not panic, [PERSON] panicked. And his selfish behavior is no surprise. After all, this is the same man who looks at [NORP] who put their lives on the line for this nation, like [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] here in [GPE] have done. Like my son [PERSON] did after [DATE] in [GPE], winning the Bronze Star, conspicuous service medal, he looks at them, he calls them suckers and losers. Who the hell does he think he is talking about? These are our heroes. They are the people who have sacrificed. They are the backbone of this country. And now as a consequence of all this overwhelming lying, negligent, and irresponsible action has come, how many chairs were empty at the dining room table [TIME] because of his negligence? Folks, we are so much better than this. Despite the crisis we face, we have enormous opportunity if we just build. We can build back better. We just got to stand up and take it back. Look, we can build an economy that gets everyone a fair return on their work, an equal chance to get ahead. For example, the communities of color here in [GPE] and across the country. The question is, how do we break that cycle where in good times you lag behind. In bad times, you get hit the hardest and first. And in recovery, the last to bounce back. Well, the answer is about justice, criminal justice, police reform. I know this nation is strong enough to do both, honestly face systemic racism and provide safe streets for our families and small businesses, that too often bear the brunt of looting and burning. We have no need for our armed militias roaming [GPE]'s streets. This is [GPE]. And we should have no tolerance for extremist white supremacist group marching, menacing our communities. But what, but if you say we have no need face racial injustice in this country, as he says, you have not opened your eyes to the truth. There've been powerful voices for justice in [DATE]. [PERSON] [DATE] daughter, who I met with in the family. I knelt down to say hi to her. And she looked at me, she said, Mr. Vice President, daddy changed the world. Daddy changed the world. [PERSON] mother, with whom I met, said violence did not her son and this nation needs healing. And then said she prayed for the police officers. [PERSON], a basketball coach, choking back tears when he said, We are the ones getting killed. We are the ones getting shot. We have been hung. It is amazing why we keep loving this country and this country does not love us back. Think about that. Think about what it takes to be a Black person to love this country [DATE] as it does, its deep love for this country. And for much too long it had not been recognized. We need leadership to deescalate tensions, open lines of communication and brings us together. To heal and to hope. As president that is precisely what I will do. But true justice is also about jobs, good paying jobs, financial stability. It was right here in [GPE], on [FAC] [DATE] that an oasis of black owned businesses thrived, even in the era of [PERSON]. [FAC] was one of the first examples of flourishing black middle-class community in [GPE]. A place that offered the country a glimpse of what we could become if we chose to live up to our founding values. Giving families of color a real shot at a home, start a small business, send a child to college debt free so they can build wealth and pass opportunity down through generations. That is what built every other middle-class group in [GPE]. That is how we deliver equality and equity. Another example, more and more women are dropping out of the workforce in this recession, whether in cities or in suburbs. I have a plan to deal with this pandemic. Responsibly testing, tracing, masking, not politicizing a race for a vaccine, planning for its safe and equitable distribution. Providing funding for [ORG] and other resources for schools to reopen safely. Easing the caregiving crisis so many families are experiencing, squeezed between raising your kids and caring for an aging, loved one. And protecting your health care. In the middle of this pandemic, why did [NORP] have the time to hold a hearing on [ORG] instead of addressing this significant economic needs of local communities? I will tell you why. For real not hyperbole, I will tell you why. It is about wiping [ORG] off the books. That is what it is about. Because their nominee has said in the past the law should be struck down. If they get their way, [CARDINAL] [NORP] will lose their protections for pre-existing conditions. Complications of COVID-19, [CARDINAL] people infected will become the next preexisting condition, allowing insurers to jack up your premiums or deny your coverage altogether. And women will again be charged more for their health just because they are women. Folks, we can do so much better. I will build on the Affordable Care Act so you can keep your private insurance. You can choose a [ORG] like option. We are going to increase subsidies that lower your premiums and deductibles [inaudible 00:12:18] out of pocket spending. Look, your governor has been working hard to expand [ORG], but it is being blocked by [NORP] legislature. My plan will automatically enroll [CARDINAL] uninsured [NORP] in a public option for free, automatically. And it is going to make a life-changing difference for so many families. But we can only do any of this if we come together as a country. We need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country. A spirit of being able to work with one another. When I say that, and I said that from the moment I announced, I am told that, Well, maybe that is you used to be able to do that, [PERSON]. That was your reputation when you were in the [ORG] and Vice President. But things have changed. They do not work that way anymore. Well, I am here to tell you they can and they will and they must if we are going to get anything done in [GPE]. I am running as a proud [NORP], but I will govern as an [NORP] president. No red states, no blue [NORP], just [GPE]. I promise you. I will work as hard for those who do not support me as those who did. That is the job of a president, a duty to care, to care for everyone in [GPE]. Folks, and you too have a sacred duty. To vote. And it matters. [GPE] matters. And Senator [PERSON] and I are asking you for your trust and support. We will always have your back, I promise you. So please, please vote and help get out the vote. Go to iwillvote.com/nc. Early voting started on [DATE]. We got to keep the incredible momentum going. We cannot let up. You can vote early in person until [DATE]. But do not wait, go vote [DATE] and do not just vote for me and Senator [PERSON]. You have got a governor's race, a [ORG] race, a record number of black women on the ballot. [ORG] and lieutenant governor. Labor commissioner and the courts. Folks, they are ready to deliver for [GPE] families. So vote, vote. It is time. It really is time. When I announced my candidacy, I had not planned on running again to be very blunt. And I have said it before. My son had just died and I had no interest. And then I saw those folks coming out of the fields in [GPE], carrying torches. Close your eyes, remember what it looked like. They are veins bulging, shouting [NORP] bile. The same bile that was shouted in the streets of [GPE] in [DATE]. Carrying [NORP] flags, accompanied by [ORG]. And a young woman was killed that was protesting the opposite direction. And when asked to comment, this President said something no other president has ever said in the history of [GPE]. He said, There were very fine people on both sides. Very fine people. Folks, I mean it when I say this it is time to restore [GPE]'s soul. It is time to rebuild the backbone of [GPE], the middle class. And this time, bring everybody along. No matter your race, your age, your religion, your gender, ethnicity, or disability. We can do this. The blinders have been taken off the [NORP] people and they have seen what is happened. It is time to unite [GPE]. Look, I will never forget what President [PERSON] said when I was a kid and we are going to the moon. Every kid in the school had to hear his speech. He used the line in that speech my [ORG] colleagues and [ORG] heard me use all the time, it made the most impression on me. He asked the unasked question, Why are we doing this? And his response was, he said, Because we refuse to postpone. This is [GPE]. We refuse to postpone [GPE]'s work that must be done. There is nothing beyond our capacity. We have never, never, never, never failed. There is no limit on our future. The only thing that can tear [GPE] part is [GPE] itself. Everybody knows who [PERSON] is. So let us let them know who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. Science over fiction. And yes, we choose truth over lies. So folks, it is time to stand up. Stand up and take back our democracy. No more time left. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressbeforejointsessionthecongressthestatetheunion16", "text": "Mr. [PERSON], Mr. Vice President, Members of [ORG], distinguished guests, and fellow [NORP]: [TIME] I want to begin by congratulating the men and women of the 112th [ORG], as well as your new Speaker, [PERSON]. And as we mark this occasion, we are also mindful of the empty chair in this [FAC], and we pray for the health of our colleague and our friend [PERSON]. It is no secret that those of us here [TIME] have had our differences over [DATE]. The debates have been contentious; we have fought fiercely for our beliefs. And that is a good thing. That is what a robust democracy demands. That is what helps set us apart as a nation. But there is a reason the tragedy in [GPE] gave us pause. Amid all the noise and passion and rancor of our public debate, [GPE] reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come from, each of us is a part of something greater, something more consequential than party or political preference. We are part of the [NORP] family. We believe that in a country where every race and faith and point of view can be found, we are still bound together as one people, that we share common hopes and a common creed, that the dreams of a little girl in [GPE] are not so different than those of our own children, that they all deserve the chance to be fulfilled. That too is what sets us apart as a nation. Now, by itself, this simple recognition will not usher in a new era of cooperation. What comes of this moment is up to us. What comes of this moment will be determined not by whether we can sit together [TIME], but whether we can work together [DATE]. I believe we can, and I believe we must. That is what the people who sent us here expect of us. With their votes, they have determined that governing will now be a shared responsibility between parties. New laws will only pass with support from [NORP] and [NORP]. We will move forward together or not at all, for the challenges we face are bigger than party and bigger than politics. At stake right now is not who wins the next election. After all, we just had an election. At stake is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country or somewhere else. It is whether the hard work and industry of our people is rewarded. It is whether we sustain the leadership that has made [GPE] not just a place on a map, but the light to the world. We are poised for progress. [DATE] after the worst recession most of us have ever known, the stock market has come roaring back, corporate profits are up, the economy is growing again. But we have never measured progress by these yardsticks alone. We measure progress by the success of our people, by the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer, by the prospects of a small-business owner who dreams of turning a good idea into a thriving enterprise, by the opportunities for a better life that we pass on to our children. That is the project the [NORP] people want us to work on--together. Now, we did that in [DATE]. Thanks to the tax cuts we passed, [NORP]' paychecks are a little bigger [DATE]. Every business can write off the full cost of new investments that they make [DATE]. And these steps, taken by [NORP] and [NORP], will grow the economy and add to the [CARDINAL] private sector jobs created [DATE]. But we have to do more. These steps we have taken over [DATE] may have broken the back of this recession, but to win the future, we will need to take on challenges that have been [DATE] in the making. Many people watching [TIME] can probably remember a time when finding a good job meant showing up at a nearby factory or a business downtown. You did not always need a degree, and your competition was pretty much limited to your neighbors. If you worked hard, chances are you'd have a job for life, with a decent paycheck and good benefits and the occasional promotion. Maybe you'd even have the pride of seeing your kids work at the same company. That world has changed. And for many, the change has been painful. I have seen it in the shuttered windows of once booming factories and the vacant storefronts on once busy [FAC]. I have heard it in the frustrations of [NORP] who've seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear, proud men and women who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the game. They are right. The rules have changed. In [DATE], revolutions in technology have transformed the way we live, work, and do business. Steel mills that once needed [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] workers can now do the same work with [CARDINAL]. [DATE], just about any company can set up shop, hire workers, and sell their products wherever there is an Internet connection. Meanwhile, nations like [GPE] and [GPE] realized that with some changes of their own, they could compete in this new world. And so they started educating their children earlier and longer, with greater emphasis on math and science. They are investing in research and new technologies. Just recently, [GPE] became the home to the world's largest private solar research facility and the world's fastest computer. So yes, the world is changed. The competition for jobs is real. But this should not discourage us. It should challenge us. Remember, for all the hits we have taken [DATE], for all the naysayers predicting our decline, [GPE] still has the largest, most prosperous economy in the world. No workers are more productive than ours. No country has more successful companies or grants more patents to inventors and entrepreneurs. We are the home to the world's best colleges and universities, where more students come to study than any place on Earth. What is more, we are the first nation to be founded for the sake of an idea: the idea that each of us deserves the chance to shape our own destiny. That is why [DATE] of pioneers and immigrants have risked everything to come here. It is why our students do not just memorize equations, but answer questions like: What do you think of that idea? What would you change about the world? What do you want to be when you grow up? The future is ours to win. But to get there, we cannot just stand still. As [PERSON] told us: The future is not a gift. It is an achievement. Sustaining the [NORP] Dream has never been about standing pat. It has required each generation to sacrifice and struggle and meet the demands of a new age. And now it is our turn. We know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of our time. We need to outinnovate, outeducate, and outbuild the rest of the world. We have to make [GPE] the best place on Earth to do business. We need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our Government. That is how our people will prosper. That is how we will win the future. And [TIME] I'd like to talk about how we get there. The first step in winning the future is encouraging [NORP] innovation. None of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will be or where the new jobs will come from. [DATE], we could not know that something called the Internet would lead to an economic revolution. What we can do--what [GPE] does better than anyone else--is spark the creativity and imagination of our people. We are the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices; the nation of [PERSON] and the [PERSON] brothers, of [ORG] and [ORG]. In [GPE], innovation does not just change our lives. It is how we make our living. Our free enterprise system is what drives innovation. But because it is not always profitable for companies to invest in basic research, throughout our history, our Government has provided cutting-edge scientists and inventors with the support that they need. That is what planted the seeds for the Internet. That is what helped make possible things like computer chips and GPS. Just think of all the good jobs--from manufacturing to retail--that have come from these breakthroughs. [DATE], when the [NORP] beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called Sputnik, we had no idea how we would beat them to the Moon. The science was not even there yet. [ORG] did not exist. But after investing in better research and education, we did not just surpass the [NORP], we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and [CARDINAL] of new jobs. This is our generation's Sputnik moment. [DATE], I said that we needed to reach a level of research and development we have not seen since the height of the space race. And in [DATE], I will be sending a budget to [ORG] that helps us meet that goal. We will invest in biomedical research, information technology, and especially clean energy technology, an investment that will strengthen our security, protect our planet, and create countless new jobs for our people. Already, we are seeing the promise of renewable energy. [PERSON] and [PERSON] are brothers who run a small [GPE] roofing company. After [DATE], they volunteered their best roofers to help repair the [ORG]. But [CARDINAL] of their factory went unused, and the recession hit them hard. [DATE], with the help of a [ORG] loan, that empty space is being used to manufacture solar shingles that are being sold all across the country. In [PERSON]'s words, We reinvented ourselves. That is what [NORP] have done for [DATE]: reinvented ourselves. And to spur on more success stories like [ORG], we have begun to reinvent our energy policy. We are not just handing out money. We are issuing a challenge. We are telling [GPE]'s scientists and engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in their fields and focus on the hardest problems in clean energy, we will fund the Apollo projects of our time. At [ORG], they are developing a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for our cars. At [ORG], they are using supercomputers to get a lot more power out of our nuclear facilities. With more research and incentives, we can break our dependence on oil with biofuels and become the first country to have [CARDINAL] electric vehicles on the road by [DATE]. We need to get behind this innovation. And to help pay for it, I am asking [ORG] to eliminate [MONEY] we currently give to oil companies. I do not know if you have noticed, but they are doing just fine on their own. [Laughter] So instead of subsidizing [DATE]'s energy, let us invest in [DATE]'s. Now, clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy jobs if businesses know there will be a market for what they are selling. So [TIME] I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal: By [DATE], [PERCENT] of [GPE]'s electricity will come from clean energy sources. Some folks want wind and solar. Others want nuclear, clean coal, and natural gas. To meet this goal, we will need them all, and I urge [NORP] and [NORP] to work together to make it happen. Maintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to [GPE]'s success. But if we want to win the future, if we want innovation to produce jobs in [GPE] and not overseas, then we also have to win the race to educate our kids. Think about it. Over [DATE], [CARDINAL] of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school education. And yet [CARDINAL] of our students are not even finishing high school. The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations. [GPE] has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree. And so the question is whether all of us, as citizens and as parents, are willing to do what is necessary to give every child a chance to succeed. That responsibility begins not in our classrooms, but in our homes and communities. It is family that first instills the love of learning in a child. Only parents can make sure the TV is turned off and homework gets done. We need to teach our kids that it is not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but the winner of the science fair. We need to teach them that success is not a function of fame or PR, but of hard work and discipline. Our schools share this responsibility. When a child walks into a classroom, it should be a place of high expectations and high performance. But too many schools do not meet this test. That is why instead of just pouring money into a system that is not working, we launched a competition called [ORG]. To [CARDINAL] [GPE], we said, If you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher quality and student achievement, we will show you the money. Race to the Top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in [DATE]. For [PERCENT] 1 percent of what we spend on education [DATE], it has led [CARDINAL] [GPE] to raise their standards for teaching and learning. And these standards were developed, by the way, not by [GPE], but by [NORP] and [NORP] Governors throughout the country. And Race to the Top should be the approach we follow [DATE] as we replace No Child Left Behind with a law that is more flexible and focused on what is best for our kids. You see, we know what is possible from our children when reform is not just a top-down mandate, but the work of local teachers and principals, school boards and communities. Take a school like [PERSON] in [GPE]. [DATE], it was rated one of the worst schools in [GPE], located on turf between [CARDINAL] rival gangs. But [DATE], [PERCENT] of the seniors received their diploma. Most will be the first in their families to go to college. And after [DATE] of the school's transformation, the principal who made it possible wiped away tears when a student said, Thank you, Ms. [PERSON], for showing that we are smart and we can make it. That is what good schools can do, and we want good schools all across the country. Let us also remember that after parents, the biggest impact on a child's success comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom. In [GPE], teachers are known as nation builders. Here in [GPE], it is time we treated the people who educate our children with the same level of respect. We want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones. And over [DATE], with so many baby boomers retiring from our classrooms, we want to prepare [CARDINAL] 000 new teachers in the fields of science and technology and engineering and math. In fact, to every young person listening [TIME] who is contemplating their career choice: If you want to make a difference in the life of our Nation, if you want to make a difference in the life of a child, become a teacher. Your country needs you. Of course, the education race does not end with a high school diploma. To compete, higher education must be within the reach of every [NORP]. That is why we have ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to banks and used the savings to make college affordable for [CARDINAL] of students. And [DATE], I ask [ORG] to go further and make permanent our tuition tax credit, worth $[MONEY], [MONEY] for [DATE] of college. It is the right thing to do. Because people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in [DATE]'s fast-changing economy, we are also revitalizing [GPE]'s community colleges. [DATE], I saw the promise of these schools at [ORG] in [GPE]. Many of the students there used to work in the surrounding factories that have since left town. [CARDINAL] mother of [CARDINAL], a woman named [PERSON], had worked in the furniture industry since she was [DATE]. And she told me she is earning her degree in biotechnology now, at [DATE], not just because the furniture jobs are gone, but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their dreams too. As [PERSON] said, I hope it tells them to never give up. If we take these steps, if we raise expectations for every child and give them the best possible chance at an education, from [DATE] they are born until the last job they take, we will reach the goal that I set [DATE]: By [DATE], [GPE] will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. [CARDINAL] last point about education: [DATE], there are [CARDINAL] of students excelling in our schools who are not [NORP] citizens. Some are the children of undocumented workers, who had nothing to do with the actions of their parents. They grew up as [NORP] and pledge allegiance to our flag, and yet they live [DATE] with the threat of deportation. Others come here from abroad to study in our colleges and universities. But as soon as they obtain advanced degrees, we send them back home to compete against us. It makes no sense. Now, I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration. And I am prepared to work with [NORP] and [NORP] to protect our borders, enforce our laws, and address the [CARDINAL] of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows. I know that debate will be difficult. I know it will take time. But [TIME], let us agree to make that effort. And let us stop expelling talented, responsible young people who could be staffing our research labs or starting a new business, who could be further enriching this Nation. The third step in winning the future is rebuilding [GPE]. To attract new businesses to our shores, we need the fastest, most reliable ways to move people, goods, and information, from high-speed rail to high-speed Internet. Our infrastructure used to be the best, but our lead has slipped. [NORP] homes now have greater Internet access than we do. Countries in Europe and [GPE] invest more in their roads and railways than we do. [GPE] is building faster trains and newer airports. Meanwhile, when our own engineers graded our Nation's infrastructure, they gave us a D. We have to do better. [GPE] is the nation that built the transcontinental railroad, brought electricity to rural communities, constructed [ORG]. The jobs created by these projects did not just come from laying down track or pavement. They came from businesses that opened near a town's new train station or the new off-ramp. So over [DATE], we have begun rebuilding for [DATE], a project that has meant [CARDINAL] of good jobs for the hard-hit construction industry. And [TIME] I am proposing that we redouble those efforts. We will put more [NORP] to work repairing crumbling roads and bridges. We will make sure this is fully paid for, attract private investment, and pick projects based [on]* what is best for the economy, not politicians. Within [DATE], our goal is to give [PERCENT] of [NORP] access to high-speed rail. This could allow you to go places in half the time it takes to travel by car. For some trips, it will be faster than flying, without the pat-down. [Laughter] As we speak, routes in [GPE] and the Midwest are already underway. Within [DATE], we will make it possible for businesses to deploy the next generation of high-speed wireless coverage to [PERCENT] of all [NORP]. This is not just about--this is not about faster Internet or fewer dropped calls. It is about connecting every part of [GPE] to the digital age. It is about a rural community in [GPE] or [GPE] where farmers and small-business owners will be able to sell their products all over the world. It is about a firefighter who can download the design of a burning building onto a handheld device, a student who can take classes with a digital textbook, or a patient who can have face-to-face video chats with her doctor. All these investments--in innovation, education, and infrastructure--will make [GPE] a better place to do business and create jobs. But to help our companies compete, we also have to knock down barriers that stand in the way of their success. For example, over [DATE], a parade of lobbyists has rigged the Tax Code to benefit particular companies and industries. Those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all. But all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and it has to change. So [TIME] I am asking [NORP] and [NORP] to simplify the system, get rid of the loopholes, level the playing field, and use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in [DATE] without adding to our deficit. It can be done. To help businesses sell more products abroad, we set a goal of doubling our exports by [DATE]. Because the more we export, the more jobs we create here at home. Already, our exports are up. Recently, we signed agreements with [GPE] and [GPE] that will support [CARDINAL], 000 jobs here in [GPE]. And [DATE], we finalized a trade agreement with [GPE] that will support [CARDINAL] 000 [NORP] jobs. This agreement has unprecedented support from business and labor, [NORP] and [NORP], and I ask this [ORG] to pass it as soon as possible. Now, before I took office, I made it clear that we would enforce our trade agreements and that I would only sign deals that keep faith with [NORP] workers and promote [NORP] jobs. That is what we did with [GPE], and that is what I intend to do as we pursue agreements with [GPE] and [GPE] and continue our Asia-Pacific and global trade talks. To reduce barriers to growth and investment, I have ordered a review of Government regulations. When we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses, we will fix them. But I will not hesitate to create or enforce commonsense safeguards to protect the [NORP] people. That is what we have done in this country for [DATE]. It is why our food is safe to eat, our water is safe to drink, and our air is safe to breathe. It is why we have speed limits and child labor laws. It is why [DATE], we put in place consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies and new rules to prevent another financial crisis. And it is why we passed reform that finally prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting patients. Now, I have heard rumors that a few of you still have concerns about our new health care law. [Laughter] So let me be the first to say that anything can be improved. If you have ideas about how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable, I am eager to work with you. We can start right now by correcting a flaw in the legislation that has placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small businesses. What I am not willing to do--what I am not willing to do--is go back to [DATE] when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because of a preexisting condition. I am not willing to tell [PERSON], a brain cancer patient from [GPE], that his treatment might not be covered. I am not willing to tell [PERSON], a small-businessman from [GPE], that he has to go back to paying $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] more to cover his employees. As we speak, this law is making prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and giving uninsured students a chance to stay on their patients'--parents' coverage. So I say to this [ORG] [TIME]: Instead of refighting the battles of [DATE], let us fix what needs fixing, and let us move forward. Now, the final critical step in winning the future is to make sure we are not buried under a mountain of debt. We are living with a legacy of deficit spending that began [DATE]. And in the wake of the financial crisis, some of that was necessary to keep credit flowing, save jobs, and put money in people's pockets. But now that the worst of the recession is over, we have to confront the fact that our Government spends more than it takes in. That is not sustainable. [DATE], families sacrifice to live within their means. They deserve a Government that does the same. So [TIME] I am proposing that starting [DATE], we freeze [DATE] domestic spending for [DATE]. Now, this would reduce the deficit by [MONEY] over [DATE] and will bring discretionary spending to the lowest share of our economy since [PERSON] was President. This freeze will require painful cuts. Already, we have frozen the salaries of hard-working [ORG] employees for [DATE]. I have proposed cuts to things I care deeply about, like community action programs. The Secretary of [ORG] has also agreed to cut [MONEY] in spending that he and his generals believe our military can do without. Now, I recognize that some in this [ORG] have already proposed deeper cuts, and I am willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without. But let us make sure that we are not doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens. And let us make sure that what we are cutting is really excess weight. Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine. It may make you feel like you are flying high at first, but it will not take long before you feel the impact. [Laughter] Now, most of the cuts and savings I have proposed only address [DATE] domestic spending, which represents [PERCENT] of our budget. To make further progress, we have to stop pretending that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough. It will not . The bipartisan fiscal commission I created [DATE] made this crystal clear. I do not agree with all their proposals, but they made important progress. And their conclusion is that the only way to tackle our deficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it, in domestic spending, defense spending, health care spending, and spending through tax breaks and loopholes. This means further reducing health care costs, including programs like [ORG] and [ORG], which are the single biggest contributor to our long-term deficit. The health insurance law we passed [DATE] will slow these rising costs, which is part of the reason that nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health care law would add [MONEY] to our deficit. Still, I am willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs, including one that [NORP] suggested [DATE]: medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits. To put us on solid ground, we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen [ORG] for future generations. We must do it without putting at risk current retirees, the most vulnerable, or people with disabilities, without slashing benefits for future generations, and without subjecting [NORP]' guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market. And if we truly care about our deficit, we simply cannot afford a permanent extension of the tax cuts for [PERCENT] of [NORP]. Before we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students, we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break. It is not a matter of punishing their success, it is about promoting [GPE]'s success. In fact, the best thing we could do on taxes for all [NORP] is to simplify the individual Tax Code. This will be a tough job, but members of both parties have expressed an interest in doing this, and I am prepared to join them. So now is the time to act. Now is the time for both sides and both [ORG] of [ORG], [NORP] and [NORP], to forge a principled compromise that gets the job done. If we make the hard choices now to rein in our deficits, we can make the investments we need to win the future. Let me take this [CARDINAL] step further. We should not just give our people a Government that is more affordable, we should give them a Government that is more competent and more efficient. We cannot win the future with a Government of the past. We live and do business in the Information Age, but the last major reorganization of the Government happened in the age of black-and-white TV. There are [CARDINAL] different agencies that deal with exports. There are [CARDINAL] different agencies that deal with housing policy. Then there is my favorite example: [ORG] is in charge of salmon while they are in fresh water, but [ORG] handles them when they are in saltwater. [Laughter] I hear it gets even more complicated once they are smoked. [Laughter] Now, we have made great strides over [DATE] in using technology and getting rid of waste. Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse. We are selling acres of [ORG] office space that has not been used in [DATE], and we will cut through redtape to get rid of more. But we need to think bigger. In [DATE], my administration will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate, and reorganize [ORG] in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive [GPE]. I will submit that proposal to [ORG] for a vote, and we will push to get it passed. In [DATE], we will also work to rebuild people's faith in the institution of Government. Because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent, you will be able to go to a web site and get that information for the very first time in history. Because you deserve to know when your elected officials are meeting with lobbyists, I ask [ORG] to do what [ORG] has already done: put that information online. And because the [NORP] people deserve to know that special interests are not larding up legislation with pet projects, both parties in [ORG] should know this: If a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it. I will veto it. The [DATE] Government that is open and competent, a government that lives within its means, an economy that is driven by new skills and new ideas--our success in this new and changing world will require reform, responsibility, and innovation. It will also require us to approach that world with a new level of engagement in our foreign affairs. Just as jobs and businesses can now race across borders, so can new threats and new challenges. No single wall separates East and West. No [CARDINAL] rival superpower is aligned against us. And so we must defeat determined enemies, wherever they are, and build coalitions that cut across lines of region and race and religion. And [GPE]'s moral example must always shine for all who yearn for freedom and justice and dignity. And because we have begun this work, [TIME] we can say that [NORP] leadership has been renewed and [GPE]'s standing has been restored. Look to [GPE], where [CARDINAL] of our brave men and women have left with their heads held high. [NORP] combat patrols have ended, violence is down, and a new Government has been formed. [DATE], our civilians will forge a lasting partnership with the [NORP] people, while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of [GPE]. [GPE]'s commitment has been kept. The [GPE] war is coming to an end. Of course, as we speak, [ORG] and their affiliates continue to plan attacks against us. Thanks to our intelligence and law enforcement professionals, we are disrupting plots and securing our cities and skies. And as extremists try to inspire acts of violence within our borders, we are responding with the strength of our communities, with respect for the rule of law, and with the conviction that [NORP] [NORP] are a part of our [NORP] family. We have also taken the fight to [ORG] and their allies abroad. In [GPE], our troops have taken [ORG] strongholds and trained [NORP] security forces. Our purpose is clear: By preventing the [ORG] from reestablishing a stranglehold over the [NORP] people, we will deny [ORG] the safe haven that served as a launching pad for 9/11. Thanks to our heroic troops and civilians, fewer [NORP] are under the control of the insurgency. There will be tough fighting ahead, and [ORG] will need to deliver better governance. But we are strengthening the capacity of the [NORP] people and building an enduring partnership with them. [DATE], we will work with [CARDINAL] countries to begin a transition to an [NORP] lead, and [DATE], we will begin to bring our troops home. In [GPE], [ORG] leadership is under more pressure than at any point since [DATE]. Their leaders and operatives are being removed from the battlefield. Their safe havens are shrinking. And we have sent a message from the [NORP] border to the Arabian Peninsula to all parts of the globe: We will not relent, we will not waver, and we will defeat you. [NORP] leadership can also be seen in the effort to secure the worst weapons of war. Because [NORP] and [NORP] approved the new START Treaty, far fewer nuclear weapons and launchers will be deployed. Because we rallied the world, nuclear materials are being locked down on every continent so they never fall into the hands of terrorists. Because of a diplomatic effort to insist that [GPE] meet its obligations, the [NORP] Government now faces tougher sanctions, tighter sanctions than ever before. And on the Korean Peninsula, we stand with our ally [GPE] and insist that [GPE] keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons. This is just a part of how we are shaping a world that favors peace and prosperity. With our [NORP] allies, we revitalized [ORG] and increased our cooperation on everything from counterterrorism to missile defense. We have reset our relationship with [GPE], strengthened [NORP] alliances, built new partnerships with nations like [GPE]. [DATE], I will travel to [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE] to forge new alliances across the Americas. Around the globe, we are standing with those who take responsibility, helping farmers grow more food, supporting doctors who care for the sick, and combating the corruption that can rot a society and rob people of opportunity. Recent events have shown us that what sets us apart must not just be our power; it must also be the purpose behind it. In south [GPE]--with our assistance--the people were finally able to vote for independence after [DATE] of war. [CARDINAL] lined up before [TIME]. People danced in the streets. [CARDINAL] man who lost [CARDINAL] of his brothers at war summed up the scene around him. This was a battlefield for most of my life, he said. Now we want to be free. And we saw that same desire to be free in [GPE], where the will of the people proved more powerful than the writ of a dictator. And [TIME] let us be clear: [GPE] stands with the people of [GPE] and supports the democratic aspirations of all people. We must never forget that the things we have struggled for and fought for live in the hearts of people everywhere. And we must always remember that the [NORP] who have borne the greatest burden in this struggle are the men and women who serve our country. [TIME] let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our Nation is united in support of our troops and their families. Let us serve them as well as they have served us, by giving them the equipment they need, by providing them with the care and benefits that they have earned, and by enlisting our veterans in the great task of building our own [ORG]. Our troops come from every corner of this country. They are [NORP], [NORP], [NORP], [NORP], [NORP]. They are [NORP] and [NORP], [NORP] and [NORP]. And yes, we know that some of them are gay. Starting [DATE], no [NORP] will be forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love. And with that change, I call on all our college campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and [ORG]. It is time to leave behind the divisive battles of the past. It is time to move forward as one Nation. We should have no illusions about the work ahead of us. Reforming our schools, changing the way we use energy, reducing our deficit, none of this will be easy. All of it will take time. And it will be harder because we will argue about everything: the costs, the details, the letter of every law. Of course, some countries do not have this problem. If the central government wants a railroad, they build a railroad, no matter how many homes get bulldozed. If they do not want a bad story in the newspaper, it does not get written. And yet, as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can sometimes be, I know there is not a person here who would trade places with any other nation on Earth. We may have differences in policy, but we all believe in the rights enshrined in our Constitution. We may have different opinions, but we believe in the same promise that says this is a place where you can make it if you try. We may have different backgrounds, but we believe in the same dream that says this is a country where anything is possible, no matter who you are, no matter where you come from. That dream is why I can stand here before you [TIME]. That dream is why a working class kid from [GPE] can sit behind me. [Laughter] That dream is why someone who began by sweeping the floors of his father's [GPE] bar can preside as Speaker of the [ORG] in the greatest nation on Earth. That dream--that American Dream--is what drove [ORG] to reinvent their roofing company for a new era. It is what drove those students at [ORG] to learn a new skill and work towards the future. And that dream is the story of a small-business owner named [PERSON]. [PERSON] started a company in [GPE], [GPE], that specializes in a new kind of drilling technology. And [DATE], he saw the news that halfway across the world, [CARDINAL] men were trapped in a [NORP] mine, and no one knew how to save them. But [PERSON] thought his company could help. And so he designed a rescue that would come to be known as Plan B. His employees worked around the clock to manufacture the necessary drilling equipment, and [PERSON] left for [GPE]. Along with others, he began drilling a [QUANTITY] hole into the ground, working [TIME] at a time without any sleep. [DATE], Plan B succeeded and the miners were rescued. But because he did not want all of the attention, [PERSON] was not there when the miners emerged. He'd already gone back home, back to work on his next project. And later, [CARDINAL] of his employees said of the rescue, We proved that [ORG] is a little company, but we do big things. We do big things. From [DATE] of our founding, [GPE] has been the story of ordinary people who dare to dream. That is how we win the future. We are a nation that says, I might not have a lot of money, but I have this great idea for a new company. I might not come from a family of college graduates, but I will be the first to get my degree. I might not know those people in trouble, but I think I can help them, and I need to try. I am not sure how we will reach that better place beyond the horizon, but I know we will get there. I know we will. We do big things. The idea of [GPE] endures. Our destiny remains our choice. And [TIME], [DATE], it is because of our people that our future is hopeful, our journey goes forward, and the state of our Union is strong. Thank you. God bless you, and may God bless [GPE].", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsdonaldtrumpphoenixarizonarallyspeechtranscriptjuly24", "text": "Thank you very much, thank you. And thank you to [PERSON] for that introduction, which was so beautiful and for your fearless leadership of [ORG] and [ORG]. Thank you, [PERSON], very much. Let me also express my incredible appreciation to the [CARDINAL] of bold, young, and proud [NORP] patriots that are with us [DATE]. What a crowd. What a crowd. And you think this is a lot of people, you ought to look outside. It is [QUANTITY] or something. That is an incredible group. Thank you. Thank you to the people outside. We love you. You are the pulse of our movement, so true, and you are the ones who will make [GPE] great again. I started saying make [GPE] great again, again, think of that. Think about that because nobody's done what we did in [DATE], the greatest economy, we will be talking about it. We have plenty of time. Does everybody have some time? I said, I look forward to this speech. They said, Oh good. I said, How long a flight is it? [TIME]? So I said, Oh, can we maybe do it by Zoom? But Zoom will never replace the real thing. Do we agree? Especially for our great young students, it cannot replace being in the classroom, can it? With your help, we will stand up for democracy and for justice. We will fight for truth, transparency and accountability, and we will not stop until we have restored our [NORP] birthright of honest, free, and fair elections. We are gathered here in [GPE] to show our support for election integrity and for the brave and unyielding conservative warriors in the [GPE] state [ORG]. Thank you. You created a movement all over the country. This is now starting all over the country. I am hearing [GPE] wants to do a forensic audit, I just heard. Even though I won [GPE] by a lot, I said, You should do it because you will find out what is going on in this country. It is crazy. When you hear defund the police, when you hear no IDs Of course, now they are trying to get into the, We never really said that. It is crazy. But when you hear open borders, how about open borders? All this stuff. In my opinion, there is no way they win elections without cheating. There is no way. There is no way. No second amendment. They are against energy. We were energy independent [DATE], energy independent. Now we are not energy independent. I saw where they are negotiating now with [ORG] again. Here we go again to negotiate. They are negotiating right now with [ORG] and with [GPE]. We had so much oil. We did not know what the hell to do with it. It is not even believable. They closed up so many sites. [DATE] I want to send our profound and everlasting gratitude to every [GPE] [NORP] who had the fortitude and the backbone to defy the lying media. Look at that. That is a lot of media. A lot of media. See the red lights are starting to go off now. They are going, Cut. Cut. He is at it again. He is talking about the media. It is easy. Hey look. Some of them are down [PERCENT]. Can you believe it? And that is because they lose credibility, but I want to just finish it. We want to demand a full forensic audit of the results of [GPE]. I particularly want to thank [ORG] president, [PERSON]. She is been great, she is been strong. And I predict when the votes come in and that is her in the [ORG], I think they are going to be so horrible that she is going to go [CARDINAL] steps further than she ever thought she'd have to because they will be in my opinion, and again, I am not involved. They are involved. This is the [GPE] state [ORG]. I think the results will be so outrageous. You have already seen some of them come that they are going to go many steps further than they would have. [ORG] committee chairman [PERSON]. Where is [PERSON]? Thank you, [PERSON]. Thank you, [PERSON]. He is here someplace. Thank you, [PERSON]. We did win. We really did. Not me. We all won. We won. Everybody. When you looked at [DATE], we were up by so much. It was over at [TIME] and then all of a sudden they close the tabulation areas. They closed everything and we wake up and all of a sudden it is tied or we are losing. And nobody believes that. They do not believe it. I tell you right now, they do not believe it. State senators, [PERSON], [PERSON]. [PERSON], you have been so incredible. [PERSON], [PERSON], thank you. Where is [PERSON]? [PERSON], thank you. Great job. Tremendous courage, you have. I appreciate it. The whole country appreciates it really a lot. [PERSON]. [PERSON], wherever you may be. [PERSON], thank you. Thank you very much. Great job. Thanks, [PERSON]. Nice to meet you. See, they all think I am involved. I am not involved. These are people that did this by themselves. They wanted to do it. They had to do it. They saw what was going on and they did it. So I am meeting some of you for the first time. Senator [PERSON], where Senator [PERSON]? Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Somebody who is been a warrior again. I do not know him. [PERSON], he is great. Where is [PERSON]? There he is. I recognize that man from television, but I do not know [PERSON]. But [PERSON], you are really an amazing guy and a brave guy and a strong smart guy. Thank you very much. All of you. [PERSON]. Where is [PERSON]? Thank you, [PERSON]. Thank you. Thank you very much, [PERSON]. Great job. Somebody else who is really been out there that is been a brave who wants to go many steps further than anybody, [PERSON]. Thank you, [PERSON]. Great job. You knew the answer early on when they were waiting for results, but you knew the answer. And I think [PERSON] is around someplace, where is [PERSON]? Good. Okay. I did not see you in the audience now. I want it. Okay. And by the way, [PERSON] has to get a special Really great. [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], what a group. I would not want to fight. I would not want to fight you. Thank you. I like that. [PERSON]. We just have a new one, [PERSON], [PERSON], and [PERSON] that is going to be a very famous That is going to be a very famous [DATE], I suspect. Good. Great to meet you. Great. [ORG] chairwoman, somebody that has tremendous courage I will tell you. Somebody that is been fighting so long and so hard and she never stops. And some people love her. And some people do not like her as much. I happen to love her, but she is. She is really a fighter. And she fights your governor who does not do a damn thing. She is fighting. He does not do a damn thing. Chairwoman [PERSON]. [PERSON]? I called up [PERSON] recently. I said, Why would not the governor want an audit? Maybe everything will prove to be correct, which we know will not happen. I said, Why would not this governor [PERSON] When I did rallies, he always wanted to be in the front row. Sir, could you mention my name please? I will mention. And I did these rallies and he was not very popular, but he won by a lot because he ran against a very defective candidate, which they found out after they nominated that [NORP]. But I'd introduce him and I would not get much of an applause and I'd get a lot of boos. And I kept saying, This guy's not very popular. But now you know what? He is not popular with me either. They came to see me. They said, Sir, would you like him to run for the [ORG]? I said, He is not getting my endorsement. I can tell you. [PERSON], there is another beauty. The [PERSON] [NORP]. [PERSON] The old Crow. He was losing his election in the I will tell you, [GPE] is a great place. I love [GPE]. They love me and I love them and I was way up and he was losing by [CARDINAL] points. And he said, Sir, I'd like to see you. He comes over. Would you give me a big endorsement? And could you do a television commercial? And I did not love the idea because I am not too high on him, but it was between him or a woman named [PERSON], a [NORP]. She had [CARDINAL] sitting in the bank and he was [CARDINAL] down and he was going to get blown away and I endorsed him and he went up [CARDINAL] points, [CARDINAL]. She did not even spend her money. She had no chance because of my endorsement he went up [CARDINAL] points and then he got up and said the nastiest things about me. That is the way politics is, I guess. [PERSON], it is not that way in [GPE] is it? Oh yeah. I think it is, [PERSON]. I think it is. No, it is not as bad. That was amazing. You endorse somebody, you help somebody. I do not want any praise. I do not want anything, but I do not want to have that kind of a thing happen. So it is [CARDINAL] of those things. But what you are doing here is incredible as everyone here fully understands. The [DATE] election was a total disgrace. It was the most corrupt. And I tell this to people. I tell it to [NORP] and a lot of them are very good people and they say, Well, sir, we have to get onto the future. Let me tell you, you are not going to have a future. First of all, our nation is being destroyed, but you are not going to have a future in [DATE] or [DATE] if you do not find out how they cheated with [CARDINAL] and even [CARDINAL] of votes, because you will not win anything. You will not win anything. And I tell [NORP], I say, You do not realize, because some of them they are good meaning, really a lot of them, most of them. We have certain people that are not good. They do not have [PERSON] the little [PERSON] of the world. They do not have I could name a few of them. Little [PERSON]. Could I have your endorsement? Yes. [DATE] after he won, he goes and starts going after [SPEAKER]. But you know what? That is the way it is. But you know, I tell people, this is the biggest issue there is. This is bigger than the border. This is bigger than anything. This is the biggest issue. And I see it just here and I'd say I'd make a speech. And I talk about the border because we straightened out the border. We had the strongest border in history. We straightened out the border and that is a big deal. But when you look at all of the death and destruction that this election has caused and wait til you see what is happening with inflation. Wait til you see the real numbers on inflation and what is going on. And wait til you go to the pump [DATE] and you see [MONEY]. We were at [MONEY] for a gallon of gasoline. It was the most corrupt, dishonest, and unfair election in the history of our country. The [NORP] know it. The corrupt media, right back there a lot of people, they know it. Big tech knows it. And most importantly, we, the [NORP] people know it. We know it. But because of the steadfast conservatives all across our nation and that is really happening now. If you look at what is going on all across. They have come from so many different states to look at your audit procedures that they go back and I will call them and say, How did you like it? What did you think? They said, We do not believe it. And then they are starting their own audits now. That is what is happening. They are coming and looking. They are looking at what [PERSON] and [PERSON] They are looking what they all set up here and they cannot Wendy, what you have done. [PERSON], I love you. [PERSON], you are [NORP]. I hope you are all [NORP], [PERSON]? That is why I get along. That is why I like him. Good. He is tough as nails too, but you know what? They are coming in. They are looking and they go back to their state and they say, This is the most incredible thing that we have seen anytime. Why would not somebody want election integrity? Why would not they want to know? And I would be very happy. It will not happen, but I would be very happy if they did it and everything was perfect. But you are not going to find that. In fact, the preliminary numbers are a total disaster and we are going to go over those numbers. The facts are coming out. The truth is being uncovered and the crime of [DATE] is being fully exposed. Thank you. With what inflation is doing to our country. The crime has never been higher than it is. Now you have in [GPE], [CARDINAL] of people are being shot [DATE] in [GPE]. We have not lost [CARDINAL] soldier in [GPE] for [DATE]. In [GPE], they have [CARDINAL] people shot over [DATE]. Many of whom die. That is worse than any war zone anywhere in the world. [GPE] and [GPE], what is happening in [GPE]. The crime in [GPE]. And [PERSON] was the greatest mayor in the history of [GPE], by the way. And they are going after him because he understands it and they are going after him. And he is a true patriot. What they are doing to [PERSON] is a disgrace. Greatest mayor and the greatest prosecutor. I mean, he was a crime fighter. He was a crime fighter, but this was the greatest mayor. And you know, if I would have said that [DATE], [DATE], it would not have meant as much. Now you realize what having a great mayor is all about because when you look at what the hell is happening to our cities, run by [NORP], all run by [NORP]. There is never been any It is a crime wave the likes of which we have never seen before. It is scary. People are afraid to walk down to the streets of [GPE] and nobody gets prosecuted except [NORP], by the way. In every fake news story about the election, they always begin by stating that claims are unproven. There is the fake news. Those claims are unproven. Do you ever notice, you read a story and you are reading about massive fraud, but they do not write about that too much. The biggest thing is they do not write But they always say, While this is totally unproven. And you are saying, Well, wait [TIME], we caught [CARDINAL] of people. And then they go, While there is no evidence, they have these little soundbites. But the craziest of them all is and always done in unison because you know, they work together. If this were a business they would be put in jail because it would be called a monopoly. But the biggest and the craziest of the big lie, they call it. You know, what is the big lie? The opposite is the big lie. The election was the big lie. And I have got to tell you, I have got to say this. I have never said it before, but I have always thought it. If I lost the election, I am okay with that. I am okay with it. Seriously. If we lost the election, we lose an election. I will go home. I will start building buildings. I will do something. I will keep myself busy. But you know what? If we lost the election, we know when we lose. In [GPE], they had an election. We did so well. And everyone knew we won by [CARDINAL] and they stole it from us. And what happened is we had [CARDINAL] senators running [DATE] and you know what happened to them? The [NORP] said, We are not going out to vote because this is rigged. This election was rigged, and they know it. You know when you win and when you lose. If I lost this election, I could handle it pretty easily. When they steal it from you and rig it, that is not easy. And we have to fight. We have no choice. We have to fight. And it starts right here with the amazing patriots in [GPE]. And you are proving the fake news media wrong. You are proving them wrong because the evidence is monumental, just like [GPE], [GPE], [GPE]. Remember people would come up to me during the campaign, the first campaign and they said, Sir, you know what I think about [GPE]? No why do you ask? Just curious. There was these rumors. Another one would come up [DATE], Sir, do you have anything to do with [GPE]? No, I never even thought of it. But after I got asked that question [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] times, I said, What the hell is going on with the [GPE]? And it was a fake deal made up by [PERSON] with a fake dossier where they pay. They play a different game. But you know, ultimately we are much bigger than them. We have many more people because when you go over their policies, the fact is those policies are not [PERCENT] of the vote. We have many, many more people. They are tough, they are mean, and they stick together. They do stick together. But their policies are so bad. They are so pathetic. If they ever had our policies, maybe there'd be [ORG], I must be honest with you, because we have not until now. And it started with these incredible people, many of whom are sitting right here. The state senators from [GPE], it started with them. And now it is turning out to be a revolution in this country because people are saying, even some [NORP], they are saying no. Knowing what happened in the election is a good thing, not a bad thing. It is a good thing. And what are they trying to hide? Why would not they want it? Now they are trying to hide at That is why I do not understand guys like [PERSON] and your commissioners. These commissioners, they are so bad. But you know, you have the witch hunt. Remember the great witch hunt and the impeachment hoax [CARDINAL] and impeachment hoax [CARDINAL]. And it shows you how the [NORP] can really stick together. We have great [NORP]. You have [PERSON]. I am going to get in trouble, but you have [PERSON] and [PERSON]. And by the way, you have [CARDINAL] of them here [TIME]. These guys I am going to I hope you love them all because those [CARDINAL] are fighters. But we will introduce them in [TIME]. They have already probably spoken. I hope they have. That way they will not take up any of our time. But they are great. Here is just some of the shocking information the auditors in [GPE] have already reported. So this is reported. This is not coming from [SPEAKER]. This has been reported. [CARDINAL]. Now I lost by [CARDINAL]. We did not lose. We won by a lot. But they say we lost. So we need [CARDINAL]. So here we go. And we have numerous categories, almost all of which are much more than we would need to win the election. And again, remember the word determinative. If I lost by [CARDINAL] and we found out that there were [CARDINAL] dead people, okay. But there were not . There were [CARDINAL] of dead people that voted in different states, [CARDINAL]. Some even applied for an application to vote. Do you believe that? So not only did they vote, they applied for an application, but if had [CARDINAL] dead people and we lost by [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL], I do not consider that. I do not . I only talk when it is much more than you need. So think of this. [CARDINAL] mail-in ballots were counted with no clear record of them being ever sent. Other than that, it was very good. There is no record of them being sent, but they were counted. So nobody knows where the hell are they, but we counter. The county has refused to disclose how many of these [CARDINAL] were in person, early votes. And how many were magically appearing in a mail-in ballot box near you? How about those boxes? How about those boxes? How about those boxes where they were coming in and [PERSON] was getting [PERCENT] of the vote? No, I do not think so. In all fairness, we'd come. We came for rallies here. We had [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] and he came and he could not fill the [CARDINAL] circles. They had to use the fake news. No, they were calling the news. Please, would you please stand over here please? They are getting newspaper reporters and reporters to stand there. They are standing with cameras. They could not fill the [CARDINAL] circles. The only thing I liked about his campaign, because he did not really campaign, the cabal campaign. Lots of people campaigned for him. But I did like the- pay for. But I did like the, the contractor, and it was not [PERSON] with his artistry. Think of that. No, the contractor, those circles were so beautiful the way they were done. I am very good at building buildings and painting and all these different things. So painting, I know what a good paint job is, and you are not getting it from [PERSON]. But no, no, it was so professionally done. It was incredible. So good. In fact, I probably will not do it yet, but at some point I am going to find out the name of the contractor that did those circles, because I want to use them for some. But what about [PERSON] getting [MONEY] per painting, and he never painted before? Could you imagine if my kids did that? Could you imagine? And now they are justifying it. Well, we want to make it non-transparent. No, actually you should make it transparent, I guess. But actually you should not make it real because it is a bribe. It is a bribe, a [PERCENT] bribe. You have good painters. For $[MONEY], you can have a portrait done on Central Park. Guys with pencils. They do so incredible. They are geniuses. They are just geniuses. You go to Central Park, and they have all these artists lined up. You negotiate a deal, they will do it for $[MONEY]. They are unbelievably talent. Some of them are beyond belief, what they can do in a short period of time. [PERSON]'s getting $[MONEY], 000. It is a bribe. It is disgraceful, and the fake news media is talking about it like it is okay, but we should have transparency. It is unbelievable. And the laptop and the laptop, I miss you too. And the laptop from hell, it is a laptop from hell. When you look at that laptop, people are writing about it. Meaning a very tiny group of people are writing. Some books are coming out. Some books by some very good people. But you know what? When you look at the laptop from hell, and then you watch the interview. It was [GPE] that did his laptop. Then they say, Was it [GPE]? Well, it may have been me. It may have been them. I think that is the end of that one. It is always [GPE]. You ever notice? It is never [GPE]. Because they are all getting rich from [GPE]. They are not getting rich from [GPE]. It is always [GPE], [GPE], [GPE] did it. [GPE]. [GPE] did it again. No, it is a disgrace. By the way, I stopped their pipeline. It was stopped. They have a pipeline going into [GPE], going into Europe. I stopped it. I put sanctions on all these states and all of these companies who were building it. [PERSON] approved it. Then as you know, you have heard this before he stopped the [FAC] pipeline. The real number is [CARDINAL], not [CARDINAL]. They said [CARDINAL] 000, [CARDINAL], 000 jobs. And they lost all over the country. People sold their home. They were so excited that we are going to be building this pipeline. Environmentally much better than a truck. Much better, frankly, than a train, a railroad, much safer. They were building it, and he stopped it like in [DATE] he stopped it. Yet he approves the biggest pipeline in the world, going from [GPE] to [GPE]. And we are supposed to protect [GPE]. I said that. I said, By the way, you would have never even heard about that pipeline if it was not for me. North Stream two, [ORG]. Nobody ever heard of that. Nobody ever talked about it until I came along. Nobody did. Look, I get along with [PERSON] because that is a good thing. I got along with him. He got along with me, but nobody was ever tougher on [GPE] that I was. This pipeline is the biggest thing they have ever done. This is [CARDINAL]. I asked [PERSON], and I get along with [PERSON] too, but she is doing what she is doing for [GPE]. Although I think the pipeline's a big mistake for [GPE] because they might as well just wave the red flag or the white flag because it is over. It is over. They are going to get [PERCENT] of their energy from [GPE]. So I said, So let me ask you, so we are spending [MONEY] to protect you from [GPE]. And you are paying [MONEY] for energy to [GPE]. What the hell is that all about? Right? So I stopped it and within [DATE] he approved it, and now they are going to be restarting it. They will have it finished in [DATE] and they are going to make [MONEY], but the [NORP] pipeline is stopped. And I can only say that is called [GPE] first versus [GPE] last. Look, they are destroying our country. If the election were the way it were, and let us say they were doing a great job, number [CARDINAL], you probably would not be as enthusiastic. Let us say they were doing a great job. By the way, your [GPE] border, which I put up the wall. It was great. It was the best it ever was. And now what is pouring into your state is not even to be believed. You know what? If instead of doing the harbor. They are saying it was [DATE] in the history of the presidency. I do not know that that is true, but I would say it is. If you look at what is happened to the economy. How about the vaccine? I came up with the vaccine. They said it would take [DATE], going to save the world. I recommend you take it. But I also believe in your freedoms [PERCENT]. But just so you understand, but it was a great achievement. But then, and we started. We are doing [CARDINAL] people a day, and then they said, We are going to put a pause on [CARDINAL] of the vaccines. What that did, that set it back so badly. And so now they are saying what a wonderful job he did. They do not say it too much anymore with respect to giving the vaccine. Now it is turning out that they cannot say that anymore. And what they have done is because they do not trust the president, people are not doing it. And that is as simple as it can be. We did such an incredible job with [ORG], with getting the gowns, the supplies, the ventilators, the masks, everything, and the press did nothing but kill us. They would say, Look how well [GPE]'s doing compared to [GPE]. How is [GPE] doing? How is [GPE] doing? [GPE] is going through hell. They said, Look how well [GPE] is doing. They would always try and pick the best country anywhere in the world that had the least problem. Those countries now are being ravaged by this plague that was sent to us by [GPE]. And by the way, [GPE] has to pay us retribution. All right. There were [CARDINAL] 000 people who voted with a registration date after the cutoff on [DATE]. So you have a cutoff, a legal cutoff, but [CARDINAL] of people voted, and that is illegal. Why did [CARDINAL] 000 people vote? Additionally, there were [CARDINAL] 000 individuals who were not on the voter rolls [DATE] after the election. Think of that. They were not on the voter rolls [DATE] after the election. ut who were on the list of voters that was published [DATE] after the election. So they were not there for the election, but [DATE] they happened to find them, okay? This alone is more than the supposed margin that you needed. It is [CARDINAL] votes. We beat it in every category. There were [CARDINAL] people who voted in [GPE] in [DATE], who were then purged from the rolls immediately after the election. Why did not they purge them before, [PERSON]? Could I ask you that question? [PERSON] said they cheated. They cheated. They cheated. We are becoming like a third world nation, and it is happening. Then [CARDINAL] ballots were found to be printed on unofficial, very thin, flimsy paper. In other words, sounds to me like they were short of ballots, and they just made them up because you have what is called quote Voter secure paper. It is very heavy. It is like the dollar bill. It is very complex stuff. But they did not have that. So they had [CARDINAL] 000 votes and that is required. It is required. You have to have it. And they found it on paper. And the reason they noticed it, I guess, number [CARDINAL], it was very light, but they saw that when you hit it with a certain pen, it went right through the paper. They say, What the kind of papers is this? that is [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] votes. And so that also would have been invalidated. They would not have allowed it to be on [DATE]. They would not have allowed it. [CARDINAL], 000 votes. I wonder who they voted for. Tell me, I wonder who they voted for. Would you say it was [PERCENT] for [PERSON] or [PERCENT]? It was also revealed in a recent hearing that there are [CARDINAL] of duplicated ballots that do not have a serial number, suggesting that votes may have been fraudulently duplicated and counted multiple times. Time after time after time. You saw it in [GPE], you saw those people go in. They said, There is a water main break. Everybody leave, everybody leave. Everybody got the hell out. They do not want to drown. They do not want a water main break. And a short while later, a woman, a political operative, we all know her name. We all know her name, and it should have been taken care of, which should have been taken care of. But a woman comes in, but it is now it is in court, and it is a big deal. She came in with a group. She did not go back to her machine. They went for the table. They lifted up the skirt of the table, and lo and behold, it was loaded up with ballots, but they were not ballots that were in boxes that ballots come. They were in other, whether it was suitcases. It was totally different. They took those, and they started putting them in. Sometimes [CARDINAL] times, sometimes [CARDINAL] times. And they stood there. And I tell you what, when people looked at that they got sick. People threw up looking at it, and law enforcement did very little, but now what is happening is I believe the courts are going to do a lot. It is a big deal going on. That was total criminal behavior. So you hear [CARDINAL] of votes. We won the state of [GPE], and we won it decisively. And we won other of these states. Is not it amazing? [PERSON]. He beat [PERSON] all over the country decisively. So did [PERSON], except in [CARDINAL] swing states where [PERSON] wiped him out with the black population. So I think that he is not going to beat [PERSON], but only of these states. So he did poorly, except in these states, he had massive victories. We are really smart people. We cannot let this happen. We cannot let this happen. Yet this is only the beginning of the irregularities the [GPE] audit is an uncovering. The authors and the auditors have collected a sworn affidavit stating that county election workers lowered signature matching standards from [CARDINAL] points of comparison to [CARDINAL], to [CARDINAL], and eventually down to [CARDINAL]. In other words, they abolished all signature matching entirely. In other words, you have a bad signature. So the machine was picking up a lot of bad signatures. They said, This is no good. Let us lower it. Let us lower it. They brought it down to [CARDINAL]. So you had no signature matching. Perhaps. This is why the county has refused to comply with an official subpoena sent out by your great [ORG] to provide images of the envelopes, which would prove whether they counted ballots and whether or not they had signatures at all. Because we think many of them had no signature at all because you cannot sign them all during [TIME]. We think they did not , and you know what else they did not have? They did not have folds. In order to have a ballot counted, it has to be folded. But so many of these pages are laying flat without a crease, without a fold. Cyber security experts have also testified that the logs for the election management system software were wiped under highly suspicious circumstances. This is them saying it, not me. With [CARDINAL] 000 requests made to the server in [DATE]. Think of that. Erasing the data permanently for the entire period surrounding the election. Gee, I wonder why they erased the data surrounding the election? I wonder why. The county has, for whatever reason, also refused to produce the network routers. We want the routers, [PERSON], [PERSON], we got to get those routers, please. The routers. Come on, [PERSON], we can get those routers. Those routers. You know what? We are so beyond the routers, there is so many fraudulent votes without the routers. But if you got those routers, what that will show, and they do not want to give up the routers. They do not want to give them. They are fighting like hell. Why are these commissioners fighting not to give the routers? How simple could it be? That will tell the truth. What are they trying to hide? Unbelievably, the auditors have testified that the master database for the election management system, sorry to tell you, has been deleted. I wonder why it was deleted. I wonder, [PERSON], why was it deleted, please? Meaning the main database for all of the election related data in [GPE] in [DATE] has been illegally erased. It is been erased. The county has also refused to provide the authority for the information. We want the information needed to access vote tabulation devices. To top it all off, they have refused to hand over the all-important chain of custody documentation for [GPE] ballots. They do not want to give it. Why do not they want to give it? Why? I stand before you [DATE] to demand nothing less than full and complete cooperation from [GPE] and from [ORG] who have fought your senate at every single turn. Incredibly. Why? Why? Why? Why are [NORP] fighting it? All they have to do is hand it over, and they are either going to be right. They are not even saying they are right. They just do not want it. They do not even say they are right. I think they know a hell of a lot about what happened, but why do not they want to do that? The citizens of [GPE], an incredible state that as you know, I won [DATE] and I won it again. Somebody came in from a media group, a very good media group, actually, said, What was the difference between [DATE] and [DATE]? I said, Well, the difference was I actually did much better in [DATE]. It is true. We got [CARDINAL] votes. We got [CARDINAL] votes more. No president in history has ever gotten anywhere close to [CARDINAL] more votes. And that is with them doing counting. So you can imagine what the real number is. Okay? Now you can imagine. Because the easiest way of cheating is to throw them away. That is easier. The postmen do not have to deliver them. The post office does not have to deliver them. It is a very [NORP] group and why not? They have the greatest pension plan that anybody's ever seen. Why not? And that is okay. But you know, a lot of them did not go to their location and when they were signed, they did not get brought back. But when you think about it, and when you think about the corruptness, why do not these people want to find out the truth? The citizens of [GPE] deserve answers. We are talking about [GPE]. You know, we are not talking about [GPE] anymore. We are talking about [GPE] because this has gone on. And I hate to say it, but this is because you are really bad, but this has gone much worse in [GPE], [GPE], much worse. We have a bunch of [NORP] senators up there. The exact opposite. You have [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL]. We have a whole bunch of them up there, but we have a bunch of RINO senators. This is not as bad anywhere near, in my opinion, as [GPE], [GPE]. You take a look at [GPE]. What they did to our poll watchers were incredible. We had poll watchers, nice people, great people. They love our country. They were [NORP], but more than anything else, they want an honest count. They'd turn them in either way. They were physically thrown the hell out and they could not get in for [DATE]. So during that period of time, vast numbers of things happen that are terrible. And not only did they throw them out, they boarded up the windows. So they could not even see inside. Then we got a court order, and they would not obey the court order. And then they kept them [QUANTITY] away. Do you know what [QUANTITY]? That is like me looking at a vote with the lady in the beautiful red dress right over there, right? That is [QUANTITY]. And I am saying, Oh gee, how is that ballot? I am [QUANTITY] away. They were threatened by thugs. In [GPE] a a recent review of valid images has shown that the error rate in the hand audit of [GPE]'s [GPE] was a whopping [PERCENT]. Would you say that is high? Including outright fabricated vote totals as well as obvious duplications of ballots amounting to potentially [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] of extra votes for [PERSON]. All of this is in addition to the recently discovered [CARDINAL] illegal votes that were potentially cast by people who did not live in the county in which they voted. Minor detail. As well as [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] people who were purged from the [GPE] rolls after the election. Think of this. I lost by [CARDINAL]. [CARDINAL]. They have [CARDINAL] plus, they were purged. They were deleted after the election was over. Far exceeding the margin needed for a [NORP] presidential victory. That is just that [CARDINAL] item. That is the only one, but we have many. In other words, it is determinative. It is no wonder that [PERSON] and the radical [NORP] are going absolutely crazy screaming about voting rights, ranting about democracy. They want democracy and resisting every effort to look into the massive fraud in [DATE]. Just so you understand, we talk about cancel culture. The biggest thing that they want canceled is they do not want you talking about the election that just took place because they say, Holy shit, they caught us. They caught us. They caught us. We have seen it. It is a scandal, the likes of which we have never had, but the only way you get away with a scandal is if they do not talk about it. They do not want to talk about it. But they are going to have to. If your votes are like people are thinking they are going to be, and when you get up and announce whatever it may be, it is not going to be able. They are not going to be able not to talk about it. The press is so dishonest. They do not want to talk about it. But if you think about cancel. Everything about cancel culture, they want cancel culture. But what they do not want to do is anything having to do with the [DATE] election. They almost got away with it. They may have gotten away with it. We are going to find out because something's going to have to be done. But I do not think so. I do not think so. If somebody robs [ORG], a beautiful jeweler, [FAC] and [FAC], good location, excellent location. And they steal the diamonds and then they get caught. They have to turn the diamonds back. It is very simple. Amazing the way it works. I only wish that my friend [PERSON] had that additional courage to send the results back to the legislatures because it all happened so quickly. They schemed in this plan for [DATE], this all happened so quickly. If he would have sent it back to the legislature, somebody gave him bad advice. The great [PERSON], you know what happened? [GPE], they could not count their votes accurately. Hear ye, hear ye, the great state of [GPE] can not accurately count its votes. You know what [PERSON] said? Long time ago, he said, Then we will keep the votes from the great state of [GPE]. He did not say, we are going to send it back. I am saying, just send it back. Maybe it comes back. But when you have more votes in some places by a lot than you have voters, I think [PERSON] would have had the right to say, Excuse me, we have more votes than we have voters. If you do not mind, please take a look at it. Just a couple of the basics. Just a little basics. So I wish he did that. I wish he did that. The radical left [NORP] communist party rigged and sold the election. And we caught them. The time to hold them responsible and fix this broken and corrupt system is not in [DATE] where it may be just as corrupt. And if it is, you are not going to win. Or in [DATE], the time is right now here in [GPE]. Right now, right now. And you know what? If you do not get down to it and if you do not find, I hate to say this because it is terrible for our country. But you are going to have [NORP] that are not going to want to vote. They are not going to want to work for [PERSON]. They are not going to want to have to work for [PERSON] and for [PERSON], Mister [PERSON], they are not going to work for you. You know what they are going to say? They are going to say, We are not going to let it happen again. And that is what happened to the [CARDINAL] senators. They are not going to work for you. And you got to get going. It is the most important issue. You got to get going. We do not have the luxury to sit back and to wait until the next election. We do not . So many people, and they are such good, I said it before. Sir, think to the future. You are leading in the polls. We just got back from [ORG]. I was at [PERCENT] approval rating in the poll. [PERCENT]. [PERSON], what am I here? I do not know. You think we are at [CARDINAL]? I want to find out. I do not know, [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL]. And they say, Sir, you are leading in the polls, sir. You are way ahead of everybody. Run in [DATE], sir, you are going to win. And I say, Wait [TIME], I just won [DATE]. The survival of our nation depends on holding these responsible. And we have to hold these responsible elections. We have to hold those that are responsible for the [DATE] presidential elections scam. It was a scam, greatest crime in history, and we have to hold these people accountable. And hopefully, and I say this, and I have confidence in it. Hopefully your Attorney General [PERSON], your state attorney general will take information. This incredible information given by these incredible warriors and patriots. He is going to take it, and he is going to do what everybody knows has to be done. If he does not do that, it would be so sad. And your governor, [PERSON], he will be of no help to you. No help to you. It is incredible. He does not want to know the answer. But more is being found out and uncovered [DATE]. Not only in [GPE], but all over the country. Numbers like you would not believe. Just this month, the former [GPE] Attorney for [GPE], [PERSON]. Look, did you ever hear of him? [PERSON], who previously prosecuted much ballot stuffing, many cases in [GPE], published a stunning letter. And he did it, I think from the heart, stating that his office received allegations of large scale voter fraud. This is [GPE] and election irregularities all over [GPE]. Also [CARDINAL] of the most corrupt places from a voter standpoint, another, along with [GPE] and some others, [CARDINAL] of the most corrupt places, but he found, and he wanted to investigate all of this. But the Attorney General [PERSON] ordered him to stand down, and [PERSON] was not the only one. And [PERSON] is very angry about it. Then [PERSON] went out and said there was not fraud in the election of any consequence. Look at the numbers. I am giving you [DATE]. Look at the numbers. And we need [CARDINAL] large ones or [CARDINAL] small ones. We have many, many to look at. But [CARDINAL] large ones. In other words, we are right there. So it is of consequence. It is only because sadly, he just did not look for fraud. When that letter came out from [PERSON], that was [DATE] for this country, sad day. I was wondering because he was all excited. [PERSON] was all excited. He was going to go in there. Then one day it is like somebody died. he was told not to do it. One day, I noticed that the fake news media was calling [PERSON], a puppet of [SPEAKER]. And he was not a puppet at all. They had a picture of him with strings where I was totally controlling him. Just not true. They were saying that [PERSON], you have to go against him, [PERSON]. Then they started saying they were going to impeach him. And they are what is called playing the ref. You know what that is? They are doing it with [ORG] too. They are nasty. You see now again, they want to impeach [PERSON]? Not that they want to impeach him. They want to scare the hell out of him so he votes along the liberal lines because if he votes along the liberal lines, they are playing the ref better than the great [PERSON] of [GPE] ever played the ref. Remember with the chair? The this they said, [PERSON], [PERSON], you are not going to win that call- Or this, they said, [PERSON], [PERSON], you are not going to win that call. He said, But I am going to win the next one. That is what they are doing. The great [PERSON], who was one of our great endorsements. I will tell you, when [PERSON] endorsed [SPEAKER], [GPE], we were doing well there before, you had to see after. [PERSON], that is a piece of work, but he said, It may not work this time, but it is going to work the next time. And the refs were afraid to say anything. It is true. That is what they are doing with our [ORG]. They are trying to scare [PERSON]. They are talking about an impeachment. I just saw it again [TIME] in the paper. They want to impeach [PERSON] again. It is not that they do. They want him to rule for them. And if he rules for them, they are never going to impeach him. But if he rules against them, like he supposed to, because he is a conservative, but they also do not want to have a packed court. So they are saying we are going to pack the courts. We are going to pack the courts. And they did the same thing to [PERSON]. They said, [SPEAKER] controls him. As soon as I saw that, I said, Here we go, because how does he get out of that? Very simply, just do things like the vote was not rigged. And he stopped them from doing it. And I am so saddened by it. But I also understand it because nobody does it better than these crooked [NORP]. Nobody does it better. So I do not blame [PERSON]. I do not blame a lot of people, but they become weak and they become ineffective and they become frightened. Like it or not, we are becoming a communist country. That is what is happening. That is what is happening. We are beyond socialism. When you have no press that you can talk to, that is how a communist country begins. They have no press. We find things in [GPE], and other than a couple of great networks, we have no press. We have no voice. I only have voice because I get great ratings. Ultimately ratings are very important. But even those lights, they still have those lights going. That is good. I am very impressed. That is good. Thank you. And if the [NORP] get some of the things they currently want passed, including the election of Corrupt Politicians Act, an infrastructure, which is not infrastructure, it will get even worse. What they are asking for is incredible. The Green New Deal, going to destroy our country, this Green New Deal. It is green new bullshit. That is what it is. It is bullshit. No more windows in buildings because environment. I always did great with these buildings that the bigger the window, the better I did, the bigger those windows, I wanted floor to ceiling windows, but they say you cannot do that anymore. We do not want any more windows. It is going to be real hard to sell apartments, I think. We have a beautiful apartment, and for environmental reasons, we have not put windows in the building. Oh great. Well, that sounds good. These people are crazy. Whatever happened to cows, remember they were going to get rid of all the cows? They stopped that, people did not like that. Remember? You know why they were going to get rid of all the cows? People will be next. People will be in there. Sadly, even in many red states, the rhinos are letting the radical left have their way on everything. In fact, I have to say this, in many cases, these weak [NORP] or rhinos, these weak [NORP] are worse. They are worse than [NORP]. And you have a couple of examples right here in [GPE] and do not nod. And do not say it because I do not want to get you in trouble. Maybe you can convince them to do what is right. But you have a couple of them right here in [GPE] and nobody knows. And I will tell you what, they are going to be defeated as sure as you are sitting there, they are going to be defeated in the primaries by real [NORP]. And it is not so far off. You have secretaries of state certified election results that were highly inaccurate. And even fraudulent they are certifying elections where the numbers are fraudulent. You have poll watches, as I said, who were illegally blocked from vote counting in [GPE], [GPE], and many, many other cities. In certain areas, there were more votes than there were voters. Think of that one. That was so easy. You say all these different things. A lot of people talking about the machines, I say, you know what? Too complex, you do not need them. It is so many different forms. They cheated in so many different ways. You do not have to get complex. You do not have to be a great scientist from [ORG]. They cheated in so many different ways. People were caught on camera illegally running ballots multiple times through voting counting machines. And remember, I am not the one trying to undermine [NORP] democracy. I am the one trying to save [NORP] democracy. I am trying to save it. Our country is being destroyed by people who have no right to destroy it. People that won an election illegally. People that should not have been elected. They lost in a landslide. [PERSON] and the radical [NORP] are wrecking our nation. I do not even believe it is him. I honestly do not believe. I do not think [PERSON] knows where the hell he is. I do not think it is him. Crime is surging. Inflation is soaring. The border is gone. We went from the strongest border ever to the weakest border ever. The border is non-existent. Illegal aliens are pouring in, in record numbers. Critical race theory is being forced into every facet of our society. Free speech is being crushed. Men are being allowed to compete in women's sports. How do you like that? Think of that. How fair is it? Did you see the weightlifter? I hate to tell you this women, but he shattered your longstanding record. This guy gets up boom, boom, like a [DATE] record, sonny, a [DATE] record. Boom. Did he do it with [CARDINAL] hand? It is so unfair. It is so unfair. So ridiculous. I will be honest though, look, we all like to win. If I were a coach, I will tell ya. I would not be talking to too many women as we know women. I'd be getting some of these people that they are women. Somebody said that if [PERSON] ever decided to get the operation, how would he be? How would he be on the court? And by the way, [PERSON], you can have him. Did you see the basketball ratings, which were terrible. But they went up after his team was defeated and that is happening. It is in sports and people do not want to see it. They want to see athletes. They want to see competition. But the last thing they want to see is men competing in women's sports. Because very soon, you are not going to have women competing anymore. I hate to say it. I hate to say, you are going to have a coach have a full team. And that team is going to win the national championship so easily, you are not going to have women competing. They are taking away your rights. That is really a women's rights movement. You cannot let that happen. And now they just allowed it to happen in the Olympics. The Olympics has gone bad too. Our infrastructure is being hacked by foreign countries left and right. [CARDINAL] of rockets are being fired at [GPE]. And [PERSON] is allowing [GPE] to be pushed around and laughed at all over the world. This did not happen when I was president. This did not happen when I was president. In addition to all of our work, to hold [NORP] accountable for their election fraud, which is massive, we must fight harder than ever before to win a colossal victory for [GPE] first [NORP], [DATE] we have to, but again, you have to solve this problem. We are going to work our asses off. But you have to solve this problem. Have to solve this problem. We must reclaim the [ORG]. We must reclaim the [ORG]. State legislatures all over. We did so well [DATE]. And governor's mansions all across the nation. [DATE], [NORP] made massive gains. I got no credit from these people. None. I made [CARDINAL] phone calls, [CARDINAL]. They are called teleconference calls. Everybody I made it to did so great. I was responsible for getting these people elected. In the [ORG], we were expected to lose [CARDINAL] seats. And instead of losing [CARDINAL] seats, we lost for the first time in [DATE], [CARDINAL] seats. And in fact, we shockingly gained [CARDINAL] seats. And in the [ORG], without my involvement, it would right now be 60/40 with the [NORP] in the lead. Nobody likes to talk about that. We had such an incredible evening in the election. We did so well in the election. They like to say, I will tell you, you had a gentleman here, a legislator here who said Thank you. And I love you too. He said, Sir, I was prepared to lose my election, people that you know. I did not know him. I spoke to him for the first time. He said, I was prepared to lose my election. [DATE], I was prepared. Then I went to [CARDINAL] of your rallies. And I saw the level of enthusiasm with [CARDINAL] of people unable to get in. [CARDINAL] 000 people, [CARDINAL] unable to get in. I saw the enthusiasm, but I was very much prepared. I assumed I was going to lose. He has been there for a long time. Then he said, And then [TIME] before the election, I walked outside with my wife. And there were all these [SPEAKER] signs, [SPEAKER], [SPEAKER], all over the place. Elect [SPEAKER], [SPEAKER] [PERSON]. They had [SPEAKER] [PERSON] and [SPEAKER], but they had all of these signs and they had the [NORP] flag and everybody was going wild. I said '[PERSON], I think I am going to win the election.' And [DATE], sir, I won the election and I won my district by a lot. And you lost my district. And there was no way that I got more votes than you. You got far more votes than I did, sir. There is no way possible. And I said to my wife, 'This election is rigged.' And what the fake news goes around saying is the reason we did so well in legislatures, the reason we did so well in [ORG] with not any loss, but all of these gains, I guess it was [CARDINAL]. All of these gains and the [ORG], we did very well. Even though [PERSON] should not have said, We will not give [MONEY] more than $[MONEY]. And the other side said, We will give you [CARDINAL]. Like it or not, that is not good politics. And frankly, they were going to get it anyway. It was a disastrous thing. He did ads where he was in the ad and he is not a popular guy. So we should have won those seats. But if you just forget those [CARDINAL] seats, we would have been 60/40. And what they try and do is say, Well, the reason we won all Did not we win every legislature in the country? The reason we won is because the legislators were far more popular than [SPEAKER]. No, it is not that, that is why I tell you that rather long story, because we carried them in, but they did not give me and the presidency, they did not give us the votes. That is all it is. It is very simple. And they are liars and they are scoundrels. And they are very bad and very dishonest, but that is just the way it is. Right here in [GPE], we must fire [CARDINAL] of the most extreme leftists in [ORG], your radical [NORP] Senator [PERSON]. And it is not that he is leftist. It is that he does not care about the border. With all the time I spent winning the legal stuff, I think we had [CARDINAL] lawsuits, we won them all, and then I could start. It would have been so much easier, but I never heard from him. He never said, How can I help? He could not care less about your border and your border in [GPE] is [CARDINAL] big We did such a great job, but he did absolutely nothing. [PERSON] has done nothing to protect your state. And if you look at the [PERSON] border crisis and it is beyond a crisis, they are saying, Oh, do not use the word crisis. Well, now that is like a nice word. He is completely owned and controlled by [PERSON] and [PERSON]. And the open border is left. Now, the socialist [NORP] and communists are trying to include amnesty in their reconciliation bill, which would turbocharge the crisis and neither [PERSON], nor anybody on the democratic side They are all fake moderates. They are fake. They say they do not say a word about it. If this change is not made soon, [GPE] will never be able to recover from what is happening. You are getting it worse than most because you are on the border. So big on the border. Taking back [GPE] begins with kicking [PERSON] the hell out of [ORG] [ORG]. With us [DATE] are a few of the [NORP] candidates running to beat [PERSON] [DATE]. And maybe if you are around, stand up. [PERSON], where is [PERSON]? [PERSON], thank you. Thank you, [PERSON], good, you are doing well. [PERSON], [PERSON]. Thank you, [PERSON]. Great job. Thank you, [PERSON]. General [PERSON]. General, thank you very much. Thank you, General. Also with us, are [GPE]'s gubernatorial candidates, [PERSON]. Hi [PERSON]. [PERSON]. Whoa. Wow. This could be [TIME] for you. Thank you very much, [PERSON]. Good job. [PERSON]. [PERSON]. Thank you, [PERSON]. And state treasurer [PERSON]. Thank you, [PERSON]. I have to tell you, maybe the most pleasure I will get out of any introductions [TIME] because these guys are warriors. They are warriors. They love your state. They love this country. We are thrilled to be joined by several of our really best people in [ORG]. They happen to reside in a place called [GPE]. First of all, [PERSON], where is [PERSON]? Warrior. You are so lucky to have these [CARDINAL] guys. There are no games with these [CARDINAL] guys. [PERSON], [PERSON]. [PERSON]. Incredible. And a woman that I have fallen in love with and the first lady is very upset about it. She is incredible. What she did during the impeachment, especially the impeachment hoax [CARDINAL], she made a name for herself. She did not do it for herself. She did it for this country. [PERSON], [PERSON]. Great. [PERSON]. Those are [CARDINAL] great people. I actually said, Do we have our stars? Yes, sir. They here. They would not miss it. But I appreciate it. You really are. You are warriors and you love this country. Thank you. When we win giant [NORP] victories and reclaim control over [ORG] and really reclaim it over our country, we will halt the radical [PERSON] agenda in its tracks. By the way, remember, I used to say, it is going to be worse? It is not him. I really do not believe. But remember I used to say it was going to be worse? [PERSON] can not believe what is happening. He is the happiest guy, he said, I never knew this was going to happen. Is that right, [PERSON]? He said, I never knew this was going to happen. He cannot believe it. This is so much more radical. They never talked about this. They never talked about closing up the pipeline [DATE]. He talked about, We are going to study it. We are going to look at it. No, he did that, got some votes and he closed it. And how about the union on the [FAC] pipeline? How about the union where they endorsed [PERSON]? And I said, You know you are going to get screwed, but they have always been with [NORP], but you know what? The voters are with me. The voters are with me and the workers. The workers are with me and with us, we will stop the federal takeover of elections and stop the [NORP] attack on voter ID. Did you see the disinformation campaign? So they do a poll [DATE] and it showed voter ID, [PERSON], is it [PERCENT], including [NORP], it is [PERCENT]. Everybody wants voter ID. Who does not want it? You go to the grocery store, you give a picture, do anything you do. You give a picture. Voter ID is at [PERCENT]. So here is their line, all of a sudden, we do not want a voter ID. Then one day they pass it on and the press plays along. We have always wanted voter ID. We have always wanted it. It is the [NORP] who do not want it. Think of this. And they had the same thing with defund the police. We want to defund the police. We will defund the police. Now crime is at the highest it is ever been in history. These police departments have been devastated. They have treated our great law enforcement, I just met a lot of them backstage, so badly with so little respect, but it is a very unpopular thing. They did not know that. Who the hell would not know that? Defund the police. I am telling you, they have got advantages, but they are dumb in a lot of ways, their policy is so bad. So now they are saying, you guys see that, It was the [NORP] that wanted to defund the police. It is just like [GPE], [GPE], [GPE]. They make up stuff. I watched that shifty shift go up to the microphone. It is extremely important to save our country. [SPEAKER] is a paid employee of [GPE]. It is unbelievable. And you know what they say, if they say it over and over and over again, in [DATE], a lot of people are not going to remember who wanted to defend the police and who did it. And they are not going to remember about voter ID, [PERSON]. And we got to be careful with that. [PERSON], we got to be careful with that. [PERSON], you are not going to let that happen. You are not going to let it, but that is what they do. And you know what it is called? Disinformation. They make up a lot of crap and they say it over and over and over. And [DATE] you say, Oh, who was the one that wanted to defund? I guess it was the [NORP]. The [NORP] are against a very serious and a very sick enemy. We will end [PERSON] war on [NORP] energy and ensure that [GPE] remains the dominant energy superpower on earth. Can you imagine they are out negotiated with [ORG] again? We did not need [ORG]. That is why I was taking everybody out of the Middle East because we needed the Middle East for oil. Now we need the Middle East for oil again. We will break up the big tech monopolies. And we will immediately shut down [PERSON] border disaster. And we are going to end, by the way, catch and release. I ended catch and release. You know what it is? You catch a criminal and you take his name or whoever, you take his name, her name, and you release them into our country. You release them. We did something slightly better. Stay in [GPE]. We have stayed in [GPE]. And we will restore our southern border. We want to remain, let them remain in [GPE]. The people, they are all over [GPE], your border, and you are getting hit hard, probably harder, much harder, but all over the country, you can go to [GPE]. You can go to all over the country. They are being hit and it is a crime wave. Big crime wave is coming out of it. Go all over the country. And you will see you are being hit. Right here in [GPE], [PERSON] has utterly demolished your border and cynically betrayed the people of the state because he never said he was going to do that. I told you he would. In [DATE] alone, border patrol encountered [PERCENT] more illegal migrants in the [GPE] sector and [PERCENT] more in [GPE] than [DATE] when I was Think of that, [PERCENT] more in [DATE]. Now that does not mean as much as this for everyone you catch, , I think [CARDINAL] come in. Some people say it is [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL]. Let us say it is [CARDINAL]. You are talking about [CARDINAL] of people are coming into our country. We expedited removals and deported criminal aliens by the [CARDINAL]. We took out [ORG] gang members by [CARDINAL], we got them out. [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] of these absolute killers. And we built [QUANTITY] of beautiful border wall. The same wall that they wanted. I went with them. I said, I do not want the anti-climb paddle on top. You know the paddle on top that you see? I said, I do not like it. I do not want it. They said, Sir, it is anti-climb. I said, Oh, in that case, I like it. And they got to paint the wall, by the way, it sounds not so nice at a speech. How can [PERSON] make a great speech and say you got to paint the wall? It is pretty basic. Remember what I used to say? There were [CARDINAL] things that will never get obsolete. Everything's obsolete. You have a new computer, [DATE], you read it is obsolete. [CARDINAL] things. What are the [CARDINAL] things? The wheel and the wall. We achieved the most secure border in [GPE] history. [PERSON]'s open border policies have blown it all up in shreds so fast. And they have enriched the drug cartels, the child smugglers, the woman's smugglers, and the vicious MS-13 gang members. They are making more money with human trafficking now and drugs, the sale of drugs, we had fentanyl down to the lowest it is been in [DATE] because it is not just people. It is the drugs that come across. We had it to the lowest. This drug is a killer. A small amount can kill [CARDINAL] people. A little amount can kill [CARDINAL] of people. We had it to the lowest level it is been in [DATE] and it was going down and now he blew the thing up. And I used to say, it is incompetence, but they must really want this to happen. Why would not they have finished the wall? It would have taken [DATE]. What are they doing? What are they doing? This is not just a national security crisis. It is truly a humanitarian catastrophe. [DATE] alone, the remains of [CARDINAL] people were tragically discovered along the [GPE] border. Just your border. [CARDINAL] migrant children were found stranded in the sweltering, [GPE] desert, having been cruelly enticed to [GPE] by [PERSON]'s rhetoric. He said, Come in everybody, come in. And they heard that and they all started walking up and I said, You cannot come in. You will be stopped. And we have [CARDINAL] 000 [NORP] soldiers that are there. I said to the president of [GPE], who I like a lot, and he actually likes me. He is from a different persuasion. He is a socialist, but he is a great gentleman. And I said, Mr. President, you are going to have to stop them because we are building the wall and they are coming in. And I worked out a deal. I said, I will not put tariffs on [CARDINAL] of cars you send over on a [DATE] basis, but you have to put [CARDINAL] 000 soldiers on our border free of charge. And he said, I will do that. Now they are gone. And now they are all gone. And those soldiers knew what they were doing. I will be honest with you, there were no games. There were no games. We did a great job during the construction of the wall. Once the wall was up, you did not need them, but you have to finish the level empty areas of the wall. The flood of illegal immigrants is also placing a crushing burden on communities across the state and throughout the nation, depleting your already overcrowded schools and hospitals and public services of critical resources, you know that. They are so crowded now because there're so many people, many of them cannot speak English. The whole thing is a catastrophe. Your kids are saying, What the hell is going on? Even before the [PERSON] border crisis, [GPE] taxpayers were spending [MONEY] a year to pay for the welfare education justice system, course and illegal immigration, $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] per [GPE] household [DATE]. And that is now going to be doubled and tripled. In our movement, we believe that your taxpayer dollars should go to support truly needing [NORP]. You have to take care of [NORP] citizens. And look, we all have a heart. I see the same thing as you do, and we want to help people. But when you say, Come up, come up, come to [GPE], our country cannot afford it. Our system is breaking down. We cannot afford it. You just cannot afford it. The whole world. This is in [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE]. They are coming in from [GPE]. They are coming in from all over the Middle East. They are coming in from [GPE]. Large numbers are coming in from [GPE]. They are coming in from all parts of Africa. numbers are coming in from [GPE]. They are coming in from all parts of Africa. They are coming in from Europe, they are coming in from all over the world. And our country's not, no country is set for that. Number [CARDINAL], you cannot afford it. Number [CARDINAL], on a human basis and even on a common sense basis, it is going to destroy it. They are destroying our country. They are destroying our country. Under my Administration, [GPE] was respected again and respected like never before. We withdrew from [ORG] corrupt We withdrew from the [ORG] corrupt Human Rights Council. So corrupt, which seemingly existed to criticize [GPE] and [GPE]. That is all they did was criticize us. But not only is [PERSON], reentered the shameful and ridiculous international tribunal, but [DATE] you saw this, the Secretary of [ORG], [PERSON], sent them a pandering and very, very strange letter begging to [ORG] to come and investigate [GPE] for its alleged systematic racism. So you have systemic racism. He says he wants it to be investigated. Systemic racism. I said, That did not happen. Did it? I thought there is nothing, it is a joke about it. But I said, That is not serious, right? Systemic racism, please come and investigate [GPE]. [ORG] action is an outrageous insult to the [NORP] people and to our country. [GPE] is the most just and virtuous nation in the world in the history of the world. And I will tell you, you are not going to have a country very much longer. You are not going to have a country. Always I talk about, we can do this, we can do that. [DATE] is a long time. [DATE] is all they need. They are going to knock out the filibuster, you watch. I used to tell [PERSON], you know what? You better knock out the filibuster and get everything approved, because they are going to do it. They will never do that, sir. Why will not they do it? Because it is bad for [GPE]. Do you think they care about [GPE]? They do not care. And [DATE] they announced that they are going to knock the hell out of it, you watch. The [CARDINAL] senators are going to do a [inaudible 01:26:36] folder, and you are going to have a big problem, especially in light of all of the disasters that [PERSON] has caused. We should not be apologizing to the world. We are apologizing for [GPE], just like [PERSON] apologized. Remember, he apologized. They should be apologizing to [GPE] for what they have done to it. That is who I think should be apologizing to. The [PERSON] Administrations, [GPE] last philosophy because it is [GPE] last. It is [GPE] last. That is all it is, is also making a mockery of our country right here at home. [DATE], [PERSON] signed an executive order pushing toxic, Critical Race Theory into our children's schools and into our military. How about our military? This poisonous left wing doctrine is flagrant racism, plain and simple. And it has no place in our schools, no place in our military and no place in our country. You remember, I ended it very rapidly with a very powerful executive order, but that executive order was immediately repealed and terminated by the radical left. A [NORP] [ORG] will defund it and ban it once and for all. They are going to ban it. They will get it done. In testimony before [ORG], lightweight Chairman of [ORG], [PERSON], actually defended the teaching of CRT, a [NORP] ideology, to our men and women in uniform. Can you believe it? These soldiers, they are the greatest. They are hearing this stuff, they are saying, I cannot believe what I am hearing. The soldiers are saying it. He said he wanted to quote, understand white rage. He wants to understand white rage. What the hell is he talking about that for? Our generals should not be focused on learning left wing ideology. They should be focused on defeating [GPE]'s enemies and winning our future wars. Hopefully we do not have them, but if we do, we have to win them. And I say it, and I will say it, whatever. The only reason I appointed [PERSON] in the first place is because [CARDINAL] of the world's most overrated generals, [PERSON] and [PERSON] could not stand him, had no respect for him and would not recommend him under any circumstances. They even tried to send him to Europe so he would not get the job. So when they did not like him, I said, Let us give this guy a shot. [DATE], when rioters were threatening to destroy [GPE] [GPE], [PERSON] practically begged me not to send in the military to stop the destruction. I was thinking about it. It is a big step to do it. Insurrection Act, big step to do it, but I was getting close, but he did not want to do it. He did not want to do that. Why would we ever want to do a thing like that? After walking, and I did plenty, I signed a executive order on statues. You knock down any of us statues, you go to jail for [DATE] and it all stopped. It was a miracle. Right, [PERSON]? It all stopped. [PERSON], that was great. We stopped it. When they were pulling down statues and then it got crazy. They start pulling down statues of [PERSON]. It would have never stopped, but I signed that order. And as soon as I signed that order, not [CARDINAL] event took place. You get [DATE] for even attempting to take it down. All stopped, amazing. It is amazing. After walking with me to the smoldering church, they tried to burn the church down [DATE], the smoke was still coming out of it. [PERSON] issued a groveling apology because he caved to the press. He was afraid of the press. And it was really in order to take off the pressure again, is what they do to these people is they come after them through the media, through every way they can. And they end up being weak people. All he had to do was say that I am proud to walk with anyone representing the President of [GPE], and people would have understood that. He apologized. And that was the end of him when he did that apology, that was the end of him, nothing to do with me. It is the office that counts. As the radicalization campaign in our military illustrates. We are seeing almost every major institution in [NORP] life be taken over and weaponized by the extreme left, including law enforcement, the military, the corporate media. These people here just, you know, it is just I hope they are , more than anybody in this room, I hope they are listening because they are destroying our country. And especially the big tech companies, which are engaged in illegal censorship of the [NORP] people. It is a first step to restoring free speech in our country. [DATE], as you probably read, I filed a major class action lawsuit suit against big tech [inaudible [DATE]]. If you want to join, you can. We are suing [ORG], [ORG], and [ORG] in [ORG]. And we will keep on fighting until we have reclaimed the sacred right of freedom of speech for every single citizen of this nation. What they do to the conservative voice, and again, they say private, but they have Section 230, which basically gives them immunity, that gives them no problems at all. We do not need lawyers. So once they do that, they have a right that nobody, Section 230, that no other company has anywhere in this country, so that no longer puts them in that category. And we can go after them and let us see what happens. But far worse than even big tech is the lame stream media, which is no longer free. And with few exceptions is totally corrupt and is truly the enemy of the people. That is all that you can say. You know that. And maybe I see it better because we can give them a statement that is so accurate and so proven. And then they write it the opposite. Whereas if you are a carpenter, you are an electrician, you are a worker, you are a lawyer, whatever you might do, you do not know that. You just think that what you are reading, they have the lowest rating right now, approval rating, in history, in the history of the rating business. They have their lowest rating, because people have gotten wise to them. And I think it is something that in terms of legacy, I am very proud of what we have been able to do. I am very proud of it. Nobody had any idea the level of deception and corruptness. The media does not report the news anymore. They only report bad things about us and make it worse. They report bad things and they make it worse and good things about them and they make it much better. And they make it much better. If there is anything bad about the other side, they never want to talk about it. Look at [PERSON]. They do not want to, you do not see it. They do not want to talk about it. Can you imagine if that were a [NORP], if that were a conservative in some high level? As an example, the network [TIME] newscasts hardly ever discuss the crime rate, which is at an all time high. The disaster taking place at the border or [PERSON] very slow vaccine rollout is very slow, very slow. They actually tried to take credit for the vaccine and that did not work out too well. They do not blame [PERSON] for anything, including the fact that the virus is making an unexpected comeback and ravaging countries throughout the world. Only in a short time ago, it looked like it was going to be good, but nobody says it is [PERSON], does anybody say it is [PERSON]'s fault? And I am not even blaming him, but does anybody say it? Because the job we did was so incredible. That is why we are in the position we are in [DATE]. So incredible. And that is all they wanted to talk about. They wanted to demean and it was a disgrace. The radical left is determined to ruin everything in [GPE]. That is what they are doing. Woke politics takes the life and joy out of everything. Woke-ism makes you lose, ruins your mind and ruins you as a person. You become warped. You become demented. The [GPE] Women's Soccer team is a very good example of what is going on. [DATE], they unexpectedly lost to [GPE], [CARDINAL] to nothing, and [NORP] were happy about it. You proved that point before I even said it. Now the left is in the process of destroying our national pastime, baseball. First, we saw the embarrassing spectacle of the Commissioner of baseball, bowing to the radical left on voter fraud. You saw what they did. You saw they moved the All-Star game. Now [CARDINAL] of the most beloved and storied franchises in baseball, all of baseball, I watched it as a kid at [FAC]. [ORG] will be changing their name, a name that was filled with history and memories. The new name will be [ORG], which is terrible. [ORG], if I were an [NORP] I'd sue. Sue them, [ORG]. I mean, what could be better? Especially if you have a good team, [ORG], it is one of the greatest names. [CARDINAL] of the most incredible logos. People love it. They are going absolutely crazy in [GPE] over the name change. [ORG], what is that all about? The insanity of the left knows no bounds. And both [NORP] and baseball fan should be greatly insulted. They want to take away our history, our heritage, our culture, and everything that holds us together. By the way, remember when [PERSON] was in [GPE], do you remember that? It was [QUANTITY] out, sorry to bring that up. And he has a bad heart. And he said he was playing golf, but actually he was meeting on an airplane with the Attorney General discussing [PERSON]. I wonder what they were discussing. Remember he said, No, no. I was only there, I was only there to discuss my grandchildren and golf. Remember that? He said he was out there to play golf, but it was [QUANTITY] [DATE], which is a little hot. What is happening to our country has sadly happened to so many others. We are at the beginning of a communist system. Radicals are seizing power and destroying everything we hold dear as [NORP] and it is happening. And I said it was going to happen. They dismantle the rule of law, censor speech, take over the free press, imprison political opponents. You see that is happening all over. Look at what I have been through for [DATE]. And of course, hold fake, phony elections. It was recently revealed that during the hand recount in [GPE], [PERSON] had batches of ballots go for him. [CARDINAL] for [PERSON], nothing for [SPEAKER]. I got nothing. I got nothing. Give me [CARDINAL] vote. [CARDINAL] vote. Even [PERSON] only got [PERCENT]. Okay. So many of our state and local offices have been overtaken by corruption. The radical left install partisan [NORP] prosecutors who are not interested in equal justice, but political justice. It is happening at a level that we have not seen this happen in [DATE]. They would wield law enforcement against political opponents, inventing that never had been prosecuted before, while murderers and criminals walk free without prosecution at all, all over the streets of our cities in particular. They have turned our cities into Banana Republics where the innocent are persecuted while crime soars. Just look at what they have done in [GPE] city. Innocent people are beaten in the streets [DATE]. People are shot in [FAC]. Rapes and murders are totally out of control. And yet what are the leftists and the attorney general and district attorney's offices working on so diligently? This is what they are working on so diligently and with such passion, it is get [SPEAKER]. They campaign on getting [SPEAKER]. Their campaign, we are going to get [SPEAKER]. We are going to take down [SPEAKER]. They do not talk about the murderers. They do not talk about no cash bail. They do not talk about all these dangerous people walking the streets so people are afraid to come to [GPE]. They are still coming after me because I will never stop fighting and winning for you. Going through it for [DATE] [DATE]. From the very beginning of our movement, we have been fighting against some of the most corrupt, powerful and entrenched forces imaginable. The professional political class, the deep state, the fake news media, the [GPE] hoaxers, the globalists, the socialists, the communists, the lobbyists, the corporate special interests who are absolutely terrible. And now the Critical Race Theorists, all of them oppose our movement for a simple reason. We believe in putting [GPE] first. It is very simple. We believe in strong families, strong borders and strong sovereign nations. We believe in fair trade for the [NORP] worker. Look at what we did with the worst trade deal in the history of the world, [ORG]. Now we have the [ORG], and [GPE] and [GPE] are not thrilled. That is a good sign by the way, but it is a great deal for us. And the stiff tariffs that I put on communist [GPE], I tell you what, all they wanted to do is not have me put on tariffs. We were getting along absolutely great until COVID came. The [GPE] virus came, we were getting along great. We are taking in [MONEY] from [GPE] in tariffs and what was happening, our farmers with the trade deal that I made with [GPE] were doing phenomenal. They are doing now phenomenally because [GPE] is buying numbers that nobody's ever seen before, corn and soybeans, everything they are buying. But you know what? Once the virus came in, I did not even talk about that trade deal. It meant nothing to me. It meant nothing to me. So sad for what is happened to our country. So said what happened to the world. So many people are dead and so seriously injured, and they are going to have to pay. We believe in low taxes, low regulations, unleashing [NORP] energy independence, and putting, we have to have independence with our energy. Think of what they are doing. Think of what they are doing. Look at what is happening at the pump. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. It is going up at a record pace, and you are going to be at $[MONEY] or $[MONEY] or $[MONEY] a gallon, and putting [NORP] jobs before the interests of foreign corporations. We believe in ending the endless foreign wars, rebuilding our military, supporting our warriors, taking care of our great veterans and bringing our troops back home, where they belong. Where they belong. And as you know, I started the move out of [GPE]. I think it was impossible for him to stop it, but it was a much different deal. I told the [ORG], I spoke to the leader and I spoke. I said, let us call him [PERSON]. I said, [PERSON], we are leaving and we are going to get along. But just in case, for any reason you decide to do something terrible to our country or beyond what is normal, because they have been fighting for [DATE], in your country, we are going to come back and we are going to hit you harder than any country has ever been hit. And I told him that. This was a telephone conversation, had a number of them. I said, We are going to get along great, but I just have to make that statement. We are going to hit you harder than any country. And he is a rough guy. This guy has been fighting from the time he is [DATE]. That is what they do. They fight. That is what they do. They fight. [GPE] did very poorly against them. [GPE] is [GPE] now, not [GPE] because of [GPE]. [GPE]. So they fight. I said, We are going to come back and hit you harder. Do you understand? He goes, Huh? He is a rough guy. I started off the conversation. I said, [PERSON], how are you? [SPEAKER]. Uh. Not a lot of social grace, but he was being nice. I think he was being as nice as he could be, [PERSON], but they are rough. That is all they do is fight. But I said, We are going to come back and hit you harder than any country has ever been hit. And your village, where I know you are and where you have everybody, that is going to be the point at which the first bomb is dropped I told him that, I told him. And he said to me, and I think he actually meant it. He said to me, I understand. I understand. And I believe beyond a deal, I believe we had a real understanding. And then we had the election rigged and stolen, and now they are going wild over there. That would not have happened if I were President, would not have happened. Too bad. Too bad. We believe in patriotic education for our children. And we strongly oppose the radical indoctrination of [GPE]'s youth. We are not going to let it happen. We are committed to defending innocent life, protecting our constitution, and to proudly upholding the [NORP] values of our nation's founding. We embrace free thought. We stand up to political correctness. We do not like political correctness. And we reject the intolerance of left wing cancel culture. We believe in law and order, and we respect and support the men and women of law enforcement, and above all we live by the words of our national motto and it will never ever change, In God We Trust. Sustained by these timeless [NORP] values and powered by the strength of these unstoppable ideas, we will press forward. We will have victory after victory. Never forget the heart, soul, brilliance, passion and patriotism of the young people here [DATE]. They are young, great people. And [PERSON], I want to thank you. What a joy you have done, what a job you have done. And to the devoted citizens all across our country, is so much greater than our opponents can even imagine. We are there. We have massive majorities and we are much stronger than them, much stronger than them. We are much stronger than they are, because unlike their agenda, our movement is not driven by the lust for control and domination of others. Our movement is driven by a love for [GPE] and an ironclad faith in the [NORP] people. I have that faith and you have that faith. We are not fighting for socialism, communism. We are not fighting for servitude. We are fighting for God, for country and we are fighting for freedom. We know in our veins that our [NORP] inheritance was passed down to us by generations of patriots who gave everything they had, their sweat, their blood, and even their very lives to build [GPE] into the most powerful nation in the history of the world. And we are not going to let it be taken away from us by a small group of radical left, [NORP] maniacs. So my fellow [NORP], our movement is the greatest in [NORP] history. There has never been a movement like we have had. We won the most important election, [DATE]. We did more than any other administration has ever done. And we did it quickly. We are not going to let it be taken away from us. The [DATE] midterms are the next phase of the battle and we will not stop there. We will keep on going until we have made [GPE] great again. With your help, we will take back the [ORG]. We will take back the [ORG] and we will take back that beautiful, gorgeous [ORG]. And we will take back our country. So working together, we will make [GPE] powerful again. Thank you. Thank you. The whole country is watching, the whole country is watching what you have done. Thank you. We will make [GPE] wealthy again. We will make [GPE] strong again. We will make [GPE] proud again. We will make [GPE] safe again, and we will make [GPE] great again. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you to [ORG]. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksthefirstladyaddressthenationalrestaurantassociationmeeting", "text": "Thanks so much. Well, good [TIME]. Let me start by thanking [PERSON] for his work and for that kind introduction. And I want to also thank [PERSON] and everyone at [ORG] for having me here. It is a pleasure for me to be with you all. So [DATE] I am going to talk about food, which is something that all of you here [DATE] know a little bit about. Together, you represent [PERCENT] of the [CARDINAL] restaurants in [GPE], from the biggest chains to the smallest diners. You know what [NORP] like to eat and what they do not . You have seen how the ingredients we put in our bodies affect the way we feel and the way we feel about ourselves. And you also understand the unique role that food, and restaurants especially, play in our own lives and in the life of our nation. Restaurants have always been places to celebrate a special occasion or mark an important milestone, to bond with new friends and grow closer as a family. They provide a service to our communities unlike any other. And even as tastes and customs have changed over time, restaurants remain an incredibly dynamic part of our [NORP] story. And [DATE], [CARDINAL] out of every [CARDINAL] dollars spent on food in this country goes towards meals outside the home -- and that is double what it was [DATE]. And [CARDINAL] of all meals [DATE] are eaten in restaurants. So it is clear that eating out has become part of our [NORP] way of life. And while restaurants are still places where we go to mark a special occasion -- to celebrate a good report card, an anniversary, a job well done -- restaurants are not just for those who can afford to splurge anymore. Instead, they have grown to fit every lifestyle and every budget. And our eating habits have evolved over time as well -- both in restaurants and at home -- but not always in ways that are good for our health. And that is another reason I wanted to talk to you [DATE] -- about an issue that is near and dear to my heart not just as First Lady, but as a mother -- and that is the epidemic of childhood obesity in [GPE] [DATE]. Now, I know you are all familiar with the statistics: how [CARDINAL] in [CARDINAL] children in this country is overweight or obese. And you know the consequences for their health -- from hypertension and diabetes to heart disease and even cancer. And I know you are all aware of the economic impact: [MONEY] we spend [DATE] treating obesity-related conditions -- costs that you pay in the form of rising health insurance premiums. So it is clear that we are facing a problem that is really big. And it is also clear that this problem has a whole range of different causes. Our kids are spending less time outside and more time on the couch in front of the TV, video games, the Internet. At school, gym classes, recess, they have been eliminated or shortened. Portion sizes in this country have ballooned. In some areas, families are having a tougher time getting regular access to fresh produce. And kids [DATE] are consuming more calories and eating more fat and sugar than ever before. And that is why, [DATE], we launched Let us Move! This is a nationwide campaign with a simple but ambitious goal: We want to solve the problem of childhood obesity in [DATE], so that kids born [DATE] can reach adulthood at a healthy weight. And Let us Move! is about attacking this problem from all different angles. It is about giving parents the information and the resources they need to make healthy decisions for their families. It is about giving grocery stores -- helping them to locate in underserved areas, so that every community has access to fresh and nutritious food. It is about getting healthier food into our schools. It is about helping our kids become more active, not just in school but at home. But here is the thing. Even if we give parents all the information they need and we improve school meals and build brand new supermarkets on every corner, none of that matters if when families step into a restaurant, they cannot make a healthy choice. And the truth is that while restaurants are offering more options and families take advantage of them more often, they are not always the healthiest choices. Research has shown that kids consume more saturated fat and less fiber and calcium when they eat out. And the meals they eat at restaurants have twice as many calories as the ones they eat at home. Now, as parents we know that many of our kids are not as healthy and active as they should be. And we desperately want to do things differently. But when stores and restaurants do not offer healthy options, or when parents do not have the information to make the best choices for their families, that is easier said than done. And as [GPE]'s restaurant owners, you are responsible for [CARDINAL] of the calories our kids get on a [DATE] basis. The choices you make determine what is listed on the menus, what is advertised on billboards, and what is served on our plates. And your decisions about how a dish is prepared, what goes into it and where is it placed on the menu, that can have a real impact on the way people eat. And that is why we need your help. And we need your help now, because when you see research showing that obese toddlers already display some warning signs for heart disease, it is clear that we just do not have the time to waste. And that is why I have been so pleased to hear about what some of you are doing already both in working with us and on your own. Here at the [ORG], you have developed [ORG] to give restaurants a strong foundation for making healthy changes. You have launched a website, Healthydiningfinder.com, to help consumers identify healthy menu options in their area. You are keeping your members up to date with the latest information and statistics about efforts to address childhood obesity. And you are working with other groups in the industry to meet the goal of doubling the amount of produce used in the food industry over [DATE]. And across the country, individual restaurants and chains are also focusing on our children's health -- not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it also makes sense for their bottom line. Right now, many restaurants are making a point to offer fresh produce and healthy choices aimed at kids and adults. Others are serving more low-fat dishes, whole grain breads, fruit on the side. Some are even offering kid-size portions of the meals they serve on the main menu. And chefs across the country are partnering with local schools to help them make healthy choices. But as positive as these examples are, the reality is it is just not enough. Together we have to do more. We have to go further. And we need your help to lead this effort. Now, what I do know is that in the restaurant industry creativity is your lifeblood. It is what sets you apart from the competition, and it keeps customers coming back for more. And [DATE] I am asking you to use that creativity to rethink the food you offer, especially dishes aimed at young people, and to help us make the healthier choice the easier choice. First, it is important to reduce the number of empty calories that our families are consuming, calories that have no nutritional benefit whatsoever. And believe me, I know this is easier said than done. After all, we as humans, we are programmed to crave sugary, fatty, salty foods. And as people who work to meet those needs, I know it is tempting to respond by creating products that are sweeter, richer and saltier than ever before. But here is the catch. See, feeding those cravings does just respond to people's natural desires, it actually helps shape them. The more of these foods people eat, the more they are accustomed to that taste, and after a while, those unhealthy foods become a permanent part of their eating habits. But here is the good news: It can work the other way around just as easily. Just as we can shape our children's preferences for high-calorie, low-nutrient foods, with a little persistence and creativity we can also turn them on to higher quality, healthier foods. It starts with offering healthier options designed specifically for kids. And [DATE], no matter what kind of restaurant you visit -- whether it is [NORP], [NORP], [NORP], [NORP] -- most kids' menus look pretty much the same. And trust me, we have seen a lot of them. [CARDINAL] local survey found that [PERCENT] of those menus includes mac and cheese -- our children's favorite; [PERCENT] includes chicken fingers; [CARDINAL] includes burgers or cheeseburgers. Some options weigh in at over [QUANTITY], and that is close to the recommended amount that a child should have for [DATE]. And I think -- and I know you all think -- that our kids deserve better than that. That is why I want to challenge every restaurant to offer healthy menu options and then provide them up front so that parents do not have to hunt around and read the small print to find an appropriately sized portion that does not contain levels -- high levels of fat, salt and sugar. These choices have to be easy to make and they have to give parents the confidence to know that they can go into any restaurant in this country and choose a genuinely healthy meal for their kids. Now, again, I know it is easier said than done. It is not easy to come up with choices that are both healthy and palatable for kids. And it may mean putting in some real effort and creativity to make this happen. But what it does not mean is providing just [CARDINAL] token healthy option on the menu, or taking out [CARDINAL] problematic ingredient and replacing it with another. And it is not about finding creative ways to market unhealthy food products as healthy. Instead, it is about producing products that actually are healthy; products that can help our children get into the habits that will last them a lifetime. This philosophy also needs to apply to the rest of the food that you offer, because just as we eat out as a family, we also should be able to eat well as a family. And as a mother of [CARDINAL] soon-to-be teenagers, I know that many kids, especially tweens and teens, eat off the same menu that their parents do. I am not asking any of you to make drastic changes to every single one of your recipes or to totally change the way you do business. But what I am asking is that you consider reformulating your menu in pragmatic and incremental ways to create healthier versions of the foods that we all love. That could mean substituting wheat pasta for white pasta in your regular recipes, or taking out an existing -- taking an existing dish and cutting the amount of butter or cream -- not enough to sacrifice flavor -- we all like flavor -- but just enough to make a meaningful difference in the amount of calories and fat. It could mean serving [PERCENT] or skim milk. Or you could make healthy sides like apple slices or carrots the default choice in a menu and make fries something customers have to request -- which would hurt me deeply. I am a fry lover. And no matter what you do, it is also important, truly important, to keep portion sizes in check, because we all know that the size of a meal is just as important as the ingredients it is made of. But your role in helping address childhood obesity is not limited to what you put on your menus and how you label them for parents. It is also about how you market those products to our kids. Our kids do not learn about the latest fast-food creations on their own. They hear about them on TV, advertisements, in the Internet, video games, and many other places. And as any parent knows, this marketing is highly effective. As a mom, I know it is my responsibility, and no one else's, to raise my kids. But we have to ask ourselves, what does it mean when so many parents are finding their best efforts undermined by an avalanche of advertisements aimed at our kids. A study [DATE] found that only a small percentage of advertising aimed at kids promoted healthy foods, while most promoted foods with a low nutritional value. And let us be clear: It is not enough just to limit ads for foods that are not healthy. It is also going to be critical to increase marketing for foods that are healthy. And if there is anyone who can sell healthy food to our kids, it is all of you, because you know what gets their attention. You know what makes a lasting impression. You certainly know what gets them to drive their poor parents crazy because they just have to have something. So I am here [DATE] to ask you to use that knowledge and that power to our kids' advantage. I am asking you to actively promote healthy foods and healthy habits to our kids. Again, I know many of you have said that you would offer and promote healthy options in a heartbeat if they were as popular as the healthy -- unhealthy options, because that is how business works, and I understand that. But I have yet to meet a single parent who does not understand the threat of childhood obesity. I have yet to meet a single parent who is not eager to buy healthier products. They just need more information. They need easier access to those products. And I have heard from more companies over [DATE] that the market is starting to move in a healthier direction. Folks are beginning to ask for more fruits and vegetables and for smaller portions. So when it comes right down to it, this is also about protecting your bottom lines and meeting the demands of your customers -- customers who I know you want to keep coming back again and again. That is why we are committed to helping increase that demand and making it easier for you to do what is right. And we have started by requiring chain restaurants to provide calorie counts on their menus and menu boards. And I am grateful for the support we have received from the [ORG] to get this done. And I want to encourage restaurants that are not providing calorie counts to join us in this effort. And because so many of the calories our kids consume come from school, we are also working to get more nutritious food into our lunchrooms and our vending machines. And, again, the [ORG] has been playing an important role in these efforts as well. As part of Let us Move, we are setting a goal of doubling the number of schools that participate in the Healthier US Schools Challenge by [DATE]. And we are working with schools and food suppliers to offer more fruits and vegetables and to cut down on that fat, sugar and salt. And, finally, we are working with mayors and other local officials to make our cities and towns healthier and to highlight restaurants that agree to serve smaller portions and promote more nutritious options. So I hope that all of you will join with us in these efforts. Together, we can help make sure that every family that walks into a restaurant can make an easy, healthy choice. We can make a commitment to promote vegetables and fruits and whole grains on every part of every menu. We can make portion sizes smaller and emphasize quality over quantity. And we can help create a culture -- imagine this -- where our kids ask for healthy options instead of resisting them. See, after all, that is one of the core ideals this industry was founded on. I recently learned that the term restaurant actually comes from the [NORP] word for restore. And when the idea of the restaurant business spread across the ocean, some of the first true restaurants in this country emphasized their ability to make people healthier and to cure what ailed them. So [DATE], you are all the heirs to that legacy. And you face a similar opportunity both as business owners -- but also as parents, not just to fulfill your obligations to shareholders, but to fulfill the obligation we all have to the next generation. So I hope that each of you will do your part to give our kids the future that we all know they deserve. And I want to truly thank you for what you have done, because you have done so much, and for what you are going to do. I look forward to working with you all in [DATE]. Good luck to you all and God bless you and your families. Take care. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsjoebidenhurricaneidafederalresponsespeechbriefingtranscriptseptember2", "text": "Good [TIME]. Sorry to keep you waiting, I was getting further updates. I spoke with Governor [PERSON] of [GPE] and Governor [PERSON] of [GPE], and I plan to speak with Governor [PERSON] of [GPE] after [TIME] devastating storm and floods from Hurricane Ida, the fifth largest hurricane in our history. Record rain fell in these states and [GPE] recorded more rain [DATE] on [DATE] than it usually sees [DATE]. We saw [QUANTITY] of rain per hour fall in Central Park. [ORG] issued a flood emergency in [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], the [GPE], [GPE], and parts of [GPE] [TIME]. This is the first time that such a warning has ever been issued for the city. People were trapped in subways with heroic men and women [ORG] rescued all of them, they were trapped. We are seeing the same story of devastation and heroism across [GPE] and [GPE] as well. For now, [CARDINAL] people in [GPE] and [GPE] died because of the storm and I want to express my heartfelt thanks to all the first responders and everyone who is been working through [TIME] and well into [TIME] to save lives and get power back. There is a lot of damage and I made it clear to the governors that my team at [ORG], [ORG], is on the ground and ready to provide all the assistance that is needed. In fact, our [ORG] Director and Administrator, [PERSON], was the chief federal response officer after Superstorm Sandy in [DATE], she knows what to do. [TIME] at the request of [GPE] Governor, [PERSON], I approved an emergency declaration for [GPE] for the counter of fire which is burning aggressively toward Lake Tahoe Basin and in [GPE]. And it is also one of the few fires that has ever burned from one side of the stair in [GPE] mountain range to the other. So far it is burned [QUANTITY]. [CARDINAL] of people had to evacuate their homes. The fire is threatening [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL], 000 structures and [CARDINAL] firefighters from the state and my federal team are working to contain and suppress this raging wildfire. [ORG] has trained and is deploying additional firefighters to support our ongoing firefighting efforts in [GPE]. This disaster declaration will help with evacuation, including sheltering and feeding for those who have been displaced. I want you to know, I have seen these firefighters up close. Their courage is astounding and they are some of the bravest people I have ever known, and I have known a lot of them. My heart goes out to them. My thanks is an abundant thanks for what they do. Now, I want to provide an update in our efforts to help [CARDINAL] of [NORP] down south recover and rebuild from Hurricane Ida. We have been monitoring this hurricane closely and the devastation it is caused. To date [CARDINAL] deaths, [CARDINAL] homes without power in [GPE] and [GPE]. While the catastrophic flooding was not as severe as it was during Hurricane Katrina [DATE], Ida was so powerful that it caused the Mississippi River to change direction, the flow, changed the flow temporarily. The good news is that as a result of a significant [MONEY] federal investment in the levee system around [FAC] in [GPE], it held, it was strong, it worked. But too many people and too many areas are still unprotected and saw a storm surge and flooding that was devastating. We have seen the reports of winds [QUANTITY]. It is not been confirmed yet by [ORG], but [QUANTITY], causing unimaginable damage with debris and down power lines, making roads impassable and slowing response efforts to save folks and property. Now, people continue to shelter-in-place. [DATE], I will be traveling to [GPE] to meet with Governor [PERSON] as well as the parish presidents and mayors and the local officials representing the effected areas. Governor [PERSON] encouraged me to come and assured me that my visit will not disrupt recovery efforts on the ground, that is what I wanted to be sure of. My message to everyone affected is we are all in this together, the nation is here to help. That is the message I have been making clear to the mayors, governors, energy and utility leaders in the region who my administration has been working closely with over [DATE]. Working with governors in the area, even before [PERSON] made landfall, I issued an emergency declarations for [GPE] and [GPE] to help us respond quickly. [ORG] pre-positioned [CARDINAL] meals and [QUANTITY] of water and other critical resources in the region before it hit. We deployed [CARDINAL] generators and we are working into getting more into the area, especially the hospitals that desperately need them. [ORG] deployed a [CARDINAL]-bed federal medical shelter in [GPE] and [CARDINAL] medical assistance teams available throughout the state. As the hurricane hit, [CARDINAL] members of [ORG] have been activated in [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE], and other states to support search and rescue and recovery efforts. For those who have lost their home, states have been working with [ORG] to open [CARDINAL] shelters across the Gulf Coast. We know that there is much to be done in this response on our part. We need to get power restored, we need to get more food, fuel, and water deployed. I get [TIME] updates on the progress from [ORG], well into [TIME], and we will be working around the clock until the critical needs of the region are fully met and we will meet them. Even as we tackle the core elements of the disaster response, we are also deploying new tools to help speed this recovery, things that have not been used very much in prior hurricane responses. Working with private companies that own and operate the lifeline infrastructure like electricity and communications, we have used the latest technology to accelerate restoration of power and cell phone service. It is beginning to get back up, there is a long way to you go. For example, to minimum the amount of time it will take to get the power back to everyone I have directed the federal aviation commission, the [ORG], authorize the use of surveillance drones to assess Ida's damage to energy infrastructure while ensuring those slights to not disrupt aerial search and rescue missions. Likewise, I have asked the [ORG] and [ORG] and [ORG] to immediately make available any satellite imagery they can help provide in assessing the extent of the damage. Drones and satellites can make the work faster by getting to the places that are most desperately in need. They can identify where the lines are down, map the damage, help get the transmission lines back up and running in all the parishes. But people, hardworking people, do the complicated and dangerous work. There are [CARDINAL] 000 linemen and clearance crews from [CARDINAL] states and [GPE] racing to restore power. In [GPE] [CARDINAL] have died on the job. This is complicated and really dangerous work, but we are moving as fast as humanly possible to get it done. It is important to know that the region hit by Ida is a key center of our nation's oil production and refining infrastructure, that is why we are not waiting to assess the full impact the storm is going to have on oil production and refineries. We are moving already quickly to increase the availability of gas and easing the pressure on gas prices around the country. I have directed the Secretary of [ORG], [PERSON], to use all of the tools at her disposal, including using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to keep gas flowing to the pumps. In order to get critical supplies to the region to beat the pandemic, I directed [ORG] to renew an energy declaration to provide flexibility on how many hours a truck driver can drive. Most people do not know there is a limitation on the number of hours you can be on the road. The transportation department is broadening that emergency declaration to include transportation of gasoline and other types of fuel as well in addition to medical supplies and food. In addition, [ORG] has approved emergency waivers for [GPE] and [GPE] that will expand the supply of gasoline that can be sold in those states and increase availability at such a critical time. These actions should help reduce the risk of gas shortages and price increases as a result of the hurricane. We also know a lot of people lost cell phone service because their particular carrier's tower went down or got damaged. [DATE] I asked [ORG], the [ORG], and my [ORG] team to work with the cell phone companies to allow customers to use roaming services, so that means that folks in the area should be able to get a signal no matter what carrier they are up on. If they are [CARDINAL] carrier down they can roam and use another carrier they are not part of, they are not signed up with. Just think of the sons and the daughters, moms and dads, and loved ones trying to reach each other and the feeling of fear or maybe something happened and it is just because the cell phones not working. Think of the [CARDINAL] of people reaching out for help. This is important and it is critical. Now, a lot of private companies and public entities are doing their part. [DATE] I am calling on insurance companies not to evade the responsibility, to keep the priorities they made to their customers and the promises they made and help some folks who are hurting. Here is the deal, [ORG] is providing critical needs assistance, for example, to help the hotel bill you racked up because you could not stay in your home during the hurricane. [ORG], [ORG], is also offering assistance to families in impacted areas, but right now we are hearing reports that some insurance companies may deny coverage for additional living assistance expenses unless the homeowner was under a mandatory evacuation order. People pay their insurance premiums and they are supposed to get payments from their insurance companies for relocation costs, but insurance companies in the face of the strongest storm since [DATE] say, No, no, we are not going to pay you what we owe you, because the fact is parishes in [GPE] like [GPE] and [GPE] issued a voluntary event order at first and may not have even had enough time to make a mandatory one as the storm moved in so fast. Other parishes, a voluntary evacuation order suggested that residents could try to protect themselves by sheltering in place against the ferocious winds. We can all understand why folks felt safest leaving their homes and going elsewhere, out of the path of the devastating storm. No one, no one fled this killer storm because they were looking for a vacation or a road trip, to be able to stay in a hotel, they left their homes because they felt it was flee or risk death, there is nothing voluntary about that, so I am calling on the private insurance companies right now at this critical moment, do not hide behind the fine print and technicality. Do your job. Keep your commitments to your communities that you insured. Do the right thing and pay your policy holders what do you owe them to cover the cost of temporary housing in the midst of a natural disaster. Help those in need, that is what all of us need to do. That is what we are trying to do. I have tasked my Senior Advisor, [PERSON], a [GPE] neighbor and former Congressman from [GPE]'s 2nd District for [DATE] to lead this relief effort. He knows the area, he knows the people, he knows how to get things done. He knows they get things done when local, state, and federal level are all working together alongside the private sector. The people of [GPE] and [GPE] are resilient and resourceful. We are going to stand with you for as long as it takes to recover and allow you to rebuild. And to the country, [DATE] of Hurricane Ida and the wildfires in the west and the unprecedented flash floods in [GPE] and [GPE] is yet another reminder that these extreme storms and the climate crisis are here. We best be better prepared. We need to act. When [ORG] returns [DATE] I am going to press for their action on my Build Back Better Plan. That is going to make historic investments in electrical infrastructure, modernizing our roads, bridges, our water systems, sewer and draining systems, electric grids and transmission lines and make them more resilient to these superstorms and wildfires, and floods that are going to happen with increasing frequency and ferocity. We are reminded that this is not about politics. Hurricane Ida did not care if you were a [NORP] or a [NORP], rural or urban, this destruction is everywhere and it is a matter of life and death and we are all in this together. This is one of the great challenges of our time, but I am confident we will meet it. We are [GPE] and there is simply nothing, you have heard me say it before, nothing beyond our capacity when we work together. So for all those who are still in harm's way, for all those struggling to deal with the aftermath of these storms and fires, I say, God bless you. Keep the faith. Everyone working [DATE] and night to look out for their fellow [NORP] is what this is about. We are going to get this done. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsaddressacceptingthepresidentialnominationtherepublicannationalconventiontampa", "text": "Mr. [PERSON], delegates. I accept your nomination for President of [GPE]. I do so with humility, deeply moved by the trust you have placed in me. It is a great honor. It is an even greater responsibility. [TIME] I am asking you to join me to walk together to a better future. By my side, I have chosen a man with a big heart from a small town. He represents the best of [GPE], a man who will always make us proud - my friend and [GPE]'s next Vice President, [PERSON]. In [DATE], you will get to know [PERSON] and [PERSON] better. But [TIME] [GPE] got to see what I saw in [PERSON] - a strong and caring leader who is down to earth and confident in the challenge this moment demands. I love the way he lights up around his kids and how he is not embarrassed to show the world how much he loves his mom. But [PERSON], I still like the playlist on my iPod better than yours. [DATE], I know that many [NORP] felt a fresh excitement about the possibilities of a new president. That president was not the choice of our party but [NORP] always come together after elections. We are a good and generous people who are united by so much more than what divides us. When that hard fought election was over, when the yard signs came down and the television commercials finally came off the air, [NORP] were eager to go back to work, to live our lives the way [NORP] always have - optimistic and positive and confident in the future. That very optimism is uniquely [NORP]. It is what brought us to [GPE]. We are a nation of immigrants. We are the children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the ones who wanted a better life, the driven ones, the ones who woke up at [TIME] hearing that voice telling them that life in that place called [GPE] could be better. They came not just in pursuit of the riches of this world but for the richness of this life. Freedom. Freedom of religion. Freedom to speak their mind. Freedom to build a life. And yes, freedom to build a business. With their own hands. This is the essence of the [NORP] experience. We [NORP] have always felt a special kinship with the future. When every new wave of immigrants looked up and saw [FAC], or knelt down and kissed the shores of freedom [QUANTITY] from [PERSON]'s tyranny, these new [NORP] surely had many questions. But none doubted that here in [GPE] they could build a better life, that in [GPE] their children would be more blessed than they. But [DATE], [DATE] from the excitement of the last election, for the first time, the majority of [NORP] now doubt that our children will have a better future. It is not what we were promised. Every family in [GPE] wanted this to be a time when they could get ahead a little more, put aside a little more for college, do more for their elderly mom who is living alone now or give a little more to their church or charity. Every small business wanted these to be [DATE] ever, when they could hire more, do more for those who had stuck with them through the hard times, open a new store or sponsor that [ORG] team. Every new college graduate thought they'd have a good job by now, a place of their own, and that they could start paying back some of their loans and build for the future. This is when our nation was supposed to start paying down the national debt and rolling back those massive deficits. This was the hope and change [GPE] voted for. It is not just what we wanted. It is not just what we expected. It is what [NORP] deserved. You deserved it because during [DATE], you worked harder than ever before. You deserved it because when it cost more to fill up your car, you cut out movie nights and put in longer hours. Or when you lost that job that paid $[MONEY] an hour with benefits, you took [CARDINAL] jobs at [TIME] and fewer benefits. You did it because your family depended on you. You did it because you are an [NORP] and you do not quit. You did it because it was what you had to do. But driving home late from that second job, or standing there watching the gas pump hit [MONEY] and still going, when the realtor told you that to sell your house you'd have to take a big loss, in those moments you knew that this just was not right. But what could you do? Except work harder, do with less, try to stay optimistic. Hug your kids a little longer; maybe spend a little more time praying that [DATE] would be [DATE]. I wish President [PERSON] had succeeded because I want [GPE] to succeed. But his promises gave way to disappointment and division. This is not something we have to accept. Now is the moment when we CAN do something. With your help we will do something. Now is the moment when we can stand up and say, I am an [NORP]. I make my destiny. And we deserve better! My children deserve better! My family deserves better. My country deserves better! So here we stand. [NORP] have a choice. A decision. To make that choice, you need to know more about me and about where I will lead our country. I was born in [DATE] in the middle of the country, a classic baby boomer. It was a time when [NORP] were returning from war and eager to work. To be an [NORP] was to assume that all things were possible. When President [PERSON] challenged [NORP] to go to the moon, the question was not whether we'd get there, it was only when we'd get there. The soles of [PERSON] boots on the moon made permanent impressions on OUR souls and in our national psyche. [PERSON] and I watched those steps together on her parent's sofa. Like all [NORP] we went to bed [TIME] knowing we lived in the greatest country in the history of the world. God bless [PERSON]. [TIME] that [NORP] flag is still there on the moon. And I do not doubt for a second that [PERSON] spirit is still with us: that unique blend of optimism, humility and the utter confidence that when the world needs someone to do the really big stuff, you need an [NORP]. That is how I was brought up. My dad had been born in [GPE] and his family had to leave during the Mexican revolution. I grew up with stories of his family being fed by [ORG] as war refugees. My dad never made it through college and apprenticed as a lath and plaster carpenter. And he had big dreams. He convinced my mom, a beautiful young actress, to give up [GPE] to marry him. He moved to [GPE], led a great automobile company and became Governor of [GPE]. We were [NORP] and growing up in [GPE]; that might have seemed unusual or out of place but I really do not remember it that way. My friends cared more about what sports teams we followed than what church we went to. My mom and dad gave their kids the greatest gift of all - the gift of unconditional love. They cared deeply about who we would BE, and much less about what we would DO. Unconditional love is a gift that [PERSON] and I have tried to pass on to our sons and now to our grandchildren. All the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers. If every child could drift to sleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family - and God's love -- this world would be a far more gentle and better place. Mom and Dad were married [DATE]. And if you wondered what their secret was, you could have asked the local florist - because every day Dad gave Mom a rose, which he put on her bedside table. That is how she found out what happened on [DATE] my father died - she went looking for him because that morning, there was no rose. My mom and dad were true partners, a life lesson that shaped me by everyday example. When my mom ran for the [ORG], my dad was there for her every step of the way. I can still hear her saying in her beautiful voice, Why should women have any less say than men, about the great decisions facing our nation? I wish she could have been here at the convention and heard leaders like Governor [PERSON], Governor [PERSON], Governor [PERSON], Senator [PERSON] and Secretary of [ORG] [PERSON]. As Governor of [GPE], I chose a woman Lt. Governor, a woman chief of staff, [CARDINAL] of my cabinet and senior officials were women, and in business, I mentored and supported great women leaders who went on to run great companies. I grew up in [GPE] in love with cars and wanted to be a car guy, like my dad. But by the time I was out of school, I realized that I had to go out on my own, that if I stayed around [GPE] in the same business, I'd never really know if I was getting a break because of my dad. I wanted to go someplace new and prove myself. Those were not the easiest of [DATE] - too many long hours and [DATE] working, [CARDINAL] young sons who seemed to have this need to re-enact a different world war [TIME]. But if you ask [PERSON] and I what we'd give, to break up [CARDINAL] more fight between the boys, or wake up in the morning and discover a pile of kids asleep in our room. Well, every mom and dad knows the answer to that. [DATE] were toughest on [PERSON], of course. She was heroic. [CARDINAL] boys, with our families a long way away. I had to travel a lot for my job then and I'd call and try to offer support. But every mom knows that does not help get the homework done or the kids out the door to school. I knew that her job as a mom was harder than mine. And I knew without question, that her job as a mom was a lot more important than mine. And as [GPE] saw [DATE] [TIME], [PERSON] would have succeeded at anything she wanted to. Like a lot of families in a new place with no family, we found kinship with a wide circle of friends through our church. When we were new to the community it was welcoming and as [DATE] went by, it was a joy to help others who had just moved to town or just joined our church. We had remarkably vibrant and diverse congregants from all walks of life and many who were new to [GPE]. We prayed together, our kids played together and we always stood ready to help each other out in different ways. And that is how it is in [GPE]. We look to our communities, our faiths, our families for our joy, our support, in good times and bad. It is both how we live our lives and why we live our lives. The strength and power and goodness of [GPE] has always been based on the strength and power and goodness of our communities, our families, our faiths. That is the bedrock of what makes [GPE], [GPE]. In [DATE], we can feel the vibrancy of [GPE]'s communities, large and small. It is when we see that new business opening up downtown. It is when we go to work in [TIME] and see everybody else on our block doing the same. It is when our son or daughter calls from college to talk about which job offer they should take.and you try not to choke up when you hear that the one they like is not far from home. It is that good feeling when you have more time to volunteer to coach your kid's soccer team, or help out on school trips. But for too many [NORP], [DATE] are harder to come by. How many days have you woken up feeling that something really special was happening in [GPE]? Many of you felt that way on [DATE] [DATE]. Hope and Change had a powerful appeal. But [TIME] I'd ask a simple question: If you felt that excitement when you voted for [PERSON], should not you feel that way now that he is President [PERSON]? You know there is something wrong with the kind of job he is done as president when the best feeling you had was [DATE] you voted for him. The President has not disappointed you because he wanted to. The President has disappointed [GPE] because he has not led [GPE] in the right direction. He took office without the basic qualification that most [NORP] have and one that was essential to his task. He had almost no experience working in a business. Jobs to him are about government. I learned the real lessons about how [GPE] works from experience. When I was [DATE], I helped start a small company. My partners and I had been working for a company that was in the business of helping other businesses. So some of us had this idea that if we really believed our advice was helping companies, we should invest in companies. We should bet on ourselves and on our advice. So we started a new business called [ORG]. The only problem was, while WE believed in ourselves, nobody else did. We were young and had never done this before and we almost did not get off the ground. In [DATE], sometimes I wondered if I had made a really big mistake. I had thought about asking my church's pension fund to invest, but I did not . I figured it was bad enough that I might lose my investors' money, but I did not want to go to hell too. Shows what I know. Another of my partners got the [ORG] pension fund to invest. [DATE] there are a lot of happy retired priests who should thank him. That business we started with [CARDINAL] people has now grown into a great [NORP] success story. Some of the companies we helped start are names you know. An office supply company called [ORG] - where I am pleased to see the [PERSON] campaign has been shopping; [ORG], which became a favorite of my sons. We started an early childhood learning center called [ORG] that First Lady [PERSON] rightly praised. At a time when nobody thought we'd ever see a new steel mill built in [GPE], we took a chance and built one in a corn field in [GPE]. [DATE] [ORG] is one of the largest steel producers in [GPE]. These are [NORP] success stories. And yet the centerpiece of the President's entire re-election campaign is attacking success. Is it any wonder that someone who attacks success has led the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression? In [GPE], we celebrate success, we do not apologize for it. We were not always successful at [ORG]. But no one ever is in the real world of business. That is what this President does not seem to understand. Business and growing jobs is about taking risk, sometimes failing, sometimes succeeding, but always striving. It is about dreams. Usually, it does not work out exactly as you might have imagined. [PERSON] was fired at [ORG]. He came back and changed the world. It is the genius of the [NORP] free enterprise system - to harness the extraordinary creativity and talent and industry of the [NORP] people with a system that is dedicated to creating [DATE]'s prosperity rather than trying to redistribute [DATE]'s. That is why every president since the Great Depression who came before the [NORP] people asking for a second term could look back at [DATE] and say with satisfaction: you are better off [DATE] than you were [DATE]. Except [PERSON]. And except this president. This president can ask us to be patient. This president can tell us it was someone else's fault. This president can tell us that [DATE] he will get it right. But this president cannot tell us that YOU are better off [DATE] than when he took office. [GPE] has been patient. [NORP] have supported this president in good faith. But [DATE], the time has come to turn the page. [DATE] the time has come for us to put the disappointments of [DATE] behind us. To put aside the divisiveness and the recriminations. To forget about what might have been and to look ahead to what can be. Now is the time to restore the Promise of America. Many [NORP] have given up on this president but they have not ever thought about giving up. Not on themselves. Not on each other. And not on [GPE]. What is needed in our country [DATE] is not complicated or profound. It does not take a special government commission to tell us what [GPE] needs. What [GPE] needs is jobs. Lots of jobs. In the richest country in the history of the world, this [PERSON] economy has crushed the middle class. Family income has fallen by $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY], but health insurance premiums are higher, food prices are higher, utility bills are higher, and gasoline prices have doubled. [DATE] more [NORP] wake up in poverty than ever before. [CARDINAL] out of [CARDINAL] [NORP] is living in poverty. Look around you. These are not strangers. These are our brothers and sisters, our fellow [NORP]. His policies have not helped create jobs, they have depressed them. And this I can tell you about where President [PERSON] would take [GPE]: His plan to raise taxes on small business will not add jobs, it will eliminate them; His assault on coal and gas and oil will send energy and manufacturing jobs to [GPE]; His [MONEY] cuts to our military will eliminate [CARDINAL] of jobs, and also put our security at greater risk; His [MONEY] cut to [ORG] to finance Obamacare will both hurt [DATE]'s seniors, and depress innovation - and jobs - in medicine. And his [MONEY] deficits will slow our economy, restrain employment, and cause wages to stall. To the majority of [NORP] who now believe that the future will not be better than the past, I can guarantee you this: if [PERSON] is re-elected, you will be right. I am running for president to help create a better future. A future where everyone who wants a job can find one. Where no senior fears for the security of their retirement. An [GPE] where every parent knows that their child will get an education that leads them to a good job and a bright horizon. And unlike the President, I have a plan to create [CARDINAL] new jobs. It has [CARDINAL] steps. First, by [DATE], North America will be energy independent by taking full advantage of our oil and coal and gas and nuclear and renewables. Second, we will give our fellow citizens the skills they need for the jobs of [DATE] and the careers of [DATE]. When it comes to the school your child will attend, every parent should have a choice, and every child should have a chance. Third, we will make trade work for [GPE] by forging new trade agreements. And when nations cheat in trade, there will be unmistakable consequences. Fourth, to assure every entrepreneur and every job creator that their investments in [GPE] will not vanish as have those in [GPE], we will cut the deficit and put [GPE] on track to a balanced budget. And fifth, we will champion SMALL businesses, [GPE]'s engine of job growth. That means reducing taxes on business, not raising them. It means simplifying and modernizing the regulations that hurt small business the most. And it means that we must rein in the skyrocketing cost of healthcare by repealing and replacing [ORG]. [DATE], women are more likely than men to start a business. They need a president who respects and understands what they do. And let me make this very clear - unlike President [PERSON], I will not raise taxes on the middle class. As president, I will protect the sanctity of life. I will honor the institution of marriage. And I will guarantee [GPE]'s first liberty: the freedom of religion. President [PERSON] promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet. MY promise...is to help you and your family. I will begin my presidency with a jobs tour. President [PERSON] began with an apology tour. [GPE], he said, had dictated to other nations. No Mr. President, [GPE] has freed other nations from dictators. Every [NORP] was relieved [DATE] President [PERSON] gave the order, and [ORG] took out [PERSON]. But on another front, every [NORP] is less secure [DATE] because he has failed to slow [GPE]'s nuclear threat. In his first TV interview as president, he said we should talk to [GPE]. We are still talking, and [GPE]'s centrifuges are still spinning. President [PERSON] has thrown allies like [GPE] under the bus, even as he has relaxed sanctions on [PERSON]'s [GPE]. He abandoned our friends in [GPE] by walking away from our missile defense commitments, but is eager to give [GPE]'s President [PERSON] the flexibility he desires, after the election. Under my administration, our friends will see more loyalty, and Mr. [PERSON] will see a little less flexibility and more backbone. We will honor [GPE]'s democratic ideals because a free world is a more peaceful world. This is the bipartisan foreign policy legacy of [PERSON] and [PERSON]. And under my presidency we will return to it once again. You might have asked yourself if [DATE] are really the [GPE] we want, the [GPE] won for us by the greatest generation. Does the [GPE] we want borrow [MONEY] from [GPE]? No. Does it fail to find the jobs that are needed for [CARDINAL] people and for [CARDINAL] the kids graduating from college? No. Are its schools lagging behind the rest of the developed world? No. And does the [GPE] we want succumb to resentment and division? We know the answer. The [GPE] we all know has been a story of the many becoming one, uniting to preserve liberty, uniting to build the greatest economy in the world, uniting to save the world from unspeakable darkness. Everywhere I go in [GPE], there are monuments that list those who have given their lives for [GPE]. There is no mention of their race, their party affiliation, or what they did for a living. They lived and died under a single flag, fighting for a single purpose. They pledged allegiance to [GPE]. That [GPE], that united [GPE], can unleash an economy that will put [NORP] back to work, that will once again lead the world with innovation and productivity, and that will restore every father and mother's confidence that their children's future is brighter even than the past. That [GPE], that united [GPE], will preserve a military that is so strong, no nation would ever dare to test it. That [GPE], that united [GPE], will uphold the constellation of rights that were endowed by our Creator, and codified in our Constitution. That united [GPE] will care for the poor and the sick, will honor and respect the elderly, and will give a helping hand to those in need. That [GPE] is the best within each of us. That [GPE] we want for our children. If I am elected President of [GPE], I will work with all my energy and soul to restore that [GPE], to lift our eyes to a better future. That future is our destiny. That future is out there. It is waiting for us. Our children deserve it, our nation depends upon it, the peace and freedom of the world require it. And with your help we will deliver it. Let us begin that future together [TIME].", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "trumpwhitehousearchivesgovbriefingsstatementsremarkspresidenttrumpstateunionaddress", "text": "Mr. [PERSON], Mr. Vice President, Members of [ORG], the First Lady of [GPE], and my fellow [NORP]: [DATE] has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the [NORP] people and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams. [TIME], our new administration had already taken very swift action. A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land. [DATE] since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission - to make [GPE] great again for all [NORP]. Over [DATE], we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We have endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of [GPE]'s soul, and the steel in [GPE]'s spine. Each test has forged new [NORP] heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be. We saw the volunteers of [ORG], racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a totally devastating hurricane. We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the [GPE] strip. We heard tales of [NORP] like [ORG] Petty Officer [PERSON], who is here [TIME] in the gallery with [PERSON]. [PERSON] was aboard [CARDINAL] of the first helicopters on the scene in [GPE] during the Hurricane Harvey. Through [TIME] of wind and rain, [PERSON] braved live power lines and deep water to help save [CARDINAL] lives. [PERSON], we all thank you. Thank you very much. We heard about [NORP] like firefighter [PERSON]. He is here with us also. [PERSON] faced down walls of flame to rescue [CARDINAL] children trapped at a [GPE] summer camp threatened by those devastating wildfires. To everyone still recovering in [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE] - everywhere - we are with you, we love you, and we always will pull through together, always. Thank you to [PERSON] and the brave people of [GPE]. Thank you very much, [PERSON]. Great job. Some trials over [DATE] touched this chamber very personally. With us [TIME] is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this [ORG] - a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work [DATE]: the legend from [GPE], Congressman [PERSON]. I think they like you, [PERSON]. We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the [ORG] officers, [ORG], and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many others; some in this room. In the aftermath - - yes. Yes. In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as [NORP] or [NORP], but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. [TIME], I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people. This is really the key. These are the people we were elected to serve. Over [DATE], the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as [NORP]. If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there is a challenge, we tame it. If there is an opportunity, we seize it. So let us begin [TIME] by recognizing that the state of our [GPE] is strong because our people are strong. And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud [GPE]. Since the election, we have created [CARDINAL] new jobs, including - - including [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] new jobs in manufacturing alone. Tremendous numbers. After [DATE] and [DATE] of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages. Unemployment claims have hit a [DATE] low. It is something I am very proud of. [NORP] unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded. And [NORP] unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history. Small-business confidence is at an all-time high. The stock market has smashed [CARDINAL] record after another, gaining [MONEY], and more, in value in just this short period of time. The great news - - the great news for [NORP]' [DATE], retirement, pension, and college savings accounts have gone through the roof. And just as I promised the [NORP] people from this podium [DATE], we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in [NORP] history. Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small business. To lower tax rates for hardworking [NORP], we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $[MONEY], 000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free. We also doubled the child tax credit. A typical family of [CARDINAL] making $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] will see their tax bill reduced by $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY], slashing their tax bill in [CARDINAL]. In [DATE], this will be the last time you will ever file under the old and very broken system, and [CARDINAL] of [NORP] will have more take-home pay starting [DATE] - a lot more. We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on [NORP] making [MONEY], 000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health plans. We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare. The individual mandate is now gone. Thank heaven. We slashed the business tax rate from [PERCENT] all the way down to [PERCENT], so [NORP] companies can compete and win against anyone else anywhere in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by [MONEY]. A lot of money. Small businesses have also received a massive tax cut, and can now deduct [PERCENT] of their business income. Here [TIME] are [PERSON] and [PERSON] of [ORG], a small, beautiful business in [GPE]. They have just finished [DATE] in their [DATE] history. Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring [CARDINAL] people, and expanding into the building next door. Good feeling. [CARDINAL] of [ORG]'s employees, [PERSON], is also with us [TIME]. [PERSON] is an all-American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the [DATE] recession, and was later hired by [ORG], where he trained to become a welder. Like many hardworking [NORP], [PERSON] plans to invest his tax cut raise into his new home and his [CARDINAL] daughters' education. [PERSON], please stand. And he is a great welder. I was told that by the man that owns that company that is doing so well. So congratulations, [PERSON]. Since we passed tax cuts, [CARDINAL] workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses - many of them [CARDINAL] and thousands of dollars per worker. And it is getting more [DATE], [DATE]. [ORG] has just announced it plans to invest a total of [MONEY] in [GPE], and hire another [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] workers. And [DATE], [ORG] announced a [MONEY] investment in [GPE], [DATE]. This, in fact, is our new [NORP] moment. There has never been a better time to start living the [NORP] Dream. So to every citizen watching at home [TIME], no matter where you have been, or where you have come from, this is your time. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in [GPE], then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve absolutely anything. [TIME], I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of a nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as [CARDINAL] team, [CARDINAL] people, and [CARDINAL] [NORP] family can do anything. We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great [NORP] flag. Together, we are rediscovering the [NORP] way. In [GPE], we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of [NORP] life. The motto is, In God We Trust. And we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support. Here [TIME] is [PERSON], a [DATE] boy from [GPE], [GPE], who noticed that veterans' graves were not marked with flags on [DATE]. He decided all by himself to change that, and started a movement that has now placed [CARDINAL] flags at the graves of our great heroes. [PERSON], a job well done. Young patriots, like [PERSON], teach all of us about our civic duty as [NORP]. And I met [PERSON] a little while ago, and he is something very special - that I can tell you. Great future. Thank you very much for all you have done, [PERSON]. Thank you very much. [PERSON]'s reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us of why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the National Anthem. [NORP] love their country, and they deserve a government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return. For [DATE], we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their government. Working with the [ORG], we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new [ORG] justice, and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country. We are totally defending our Second Amendment, and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty. And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions. [DATE], [ORG] also passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, my administration has already removed [CARDINAL] 500 [ORG] employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve. And we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do. And I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey. All [NORP] deserve accountability and respect, and that is what we are giving to our wonderful heroes, our veterans. Thank you. So, [TIME], I call on [ORG] to empower every [ORG] Secretary with the authority to reward good workers and to remove federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the [NORP] people. In our drive to make [ORG] accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in [DATE] than any administration in the history of our country. We have ended the war on [NORP] energy, and we have ended the war on beautiful clean coal. We are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world. In [GPE], I halted government mandates that crippled [GPE]'s great, beautiful autoworkers so that we can get [GPE] revving its engines again. And that is what is happening. Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in [GPE] - something we have not seen for [DATE]. [ORG] is moving a major plant from [GPE] to [GPE]. [ORG] and [ORG] are opening up a plant in [GPE] - a big one. And we have not seen this in a long time. It is all coming back. Very soon, auto plants and other plants will be opening up all over our country. This is all news [NORP] are totally unaccustomed to hearing. For [DATE], companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are roaring back. They are coming back. They want to be where the action is. They want to be in [GPE]. That is where they want to be. Exciting progress is happening [DATE]. To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, [DATE] the [ORG] approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our country's history. We also believe that patients with terminal conditions, and terminal illness, should have access to experimental treatment immediately that could potentially save their lives. People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure. I want to give them a chance right here at home. It is time for [ORG] to give these wonderful, incredible [NORP] the right to try. [CARDINAL] of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in [GPE]. And it is very, very unfair. That is why I have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top priorities for [DATE]. And prices will come down substantially. Watch. [GPE] has also finally turned the page on [DATE] of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our wealth. Our nation has lost its wealth, but we are getting it back so fast. The era of economic surrender is totally over. From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and, very importantly, reciprocal. We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones. And they will be good ones, but they will be fair. And we will protect [NORP] workers and [NORP] intellectual property through strong enforcement of our trade rules. As we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. [GPE] is a nation of builders. We built [FAC] in [DATE]. Is not it a disgrace that it can now take [DATE] just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road? I am asking both parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve. [TIME], I am calling on [ORG] to produce a bill that generates [MONEY] for the new infrastructure investment that our country so desperately needs. Every federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with state and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit. And we can do it. Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process, getting it down to [DATE], and perhaps even [CARDINAL]. Together, we can reclaim our great building heritage. We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways all across our land. And we will do it with [NORP] heart, and [NORP] hands, and [NORP] grit. We want every [NORP] to know the dignity of [DATE] work. We want every child to be safe in their home at [TIME]. And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we all love so much. We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. As tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and let us invest in job training, which we need so badly. Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential. And let us support working families by supporting paid family leave. As [GPE] regains its strength, opportunity must be extended to all citizens. That is why [DATE] we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance at life. Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of [NORP] workers and [NORP] families. For [DATE], open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They have allowed [CARDINAL] of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest [NORP]. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives. Here [TIME] are [CARDINAL] fathers and [CARDINAL] mothers: [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], and [PERSON]. Their [CARDINAL] teenage daughters - [PERSON] and [PERSON] - were close friends on Long Island. But in [DATE], on [DATE] of [PERSON]'s 16th Birthday - such a happy time it should have been - neither of them came home. These [CARDINAL] precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown. [CARDINAL] members of the savage [ORG] gang have been charged with [PERSON] and [PERSON]'s murders. Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as illegal, unaccompanied alien minors, and wound up in [PERSON] and [PERSON]'s high school. [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], and [PERSON]: [TIME], everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in [GPE] is grieving for you. Please stand. Thank you very much. I want you to know that [CARDINAL] hearts are right now breaking for you. We love you. Thank you. While we cannot imagine the depths of that kind of sorrow, we can make sure that other families never have to endure this kind of pain. [TIME], I am calling on [ORG] to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminal gangs, to break into our country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws and support our [ORG] and [ORG] agents - these are great people; these are great, great people - that work so hard in the midst of such danger so that this can never happen again. [GPE] is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do more than any other country anywhere in the world to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as President of [GPE], my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, my constant concern is for [GPE]'s children, [GPE]'s struggling workers, and [GPE]'s forgotten communities. I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise. So, [TIME], I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties, [NORP] and [NORP], to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed. My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend [NORP], to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the [NORP] Dream. Because [NORP] are dreamers too. Here [TIME] is [CARDINAL] leader in the effort to defend our country, [ORG] Special Agent [PERSON]. He goes by [PERSON] and [PERSON]. He said, Call me either one. So we will call you [PERSON]. Served [DATE] in [ORG] before becoming an [ORG] agent and spending [DATE] fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off of our streets. Tough job. At [CARDINAL] point, MS-13 leaders ordered [PERSON]'s murder. And they wanted it to happen quickly. But he did not cave to threats or to fear. [DATE], he commanded an operation to track down gang members on [GPE]. His team has arrested [CARDINAL], including [CARDINAL] MS-13 gang members. And I have to tell you, what [ORG] and [ORG] have done - we have sent [CARDINAL] of MS-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons. So I just want to congratulate you, [PERSON]. You are a brave guy. Thank you very much. And I asked [PERSON], What is the secret? He said, We are just tougher than they are. And I like that answer. Now let us get [ORG] to send you - and all of the people in this great chamber have to do it; we have no choice. [PERSON], we are going to send you reinforcements, and we are going to send them to you quickly. It is what you need. Over [DATE], the [ORG] and [ORG] will be voting on an immigration reform package. In [DATE], my administration has met extensively with both [NORP] and [NORP] to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented [ORG] with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise, one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have. Here are the [CARDINAL] pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for [CARDINAL] illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age. That covers [CARDINAL] times more people than the previous administration covered. Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of [GPE] over a [DATE] period. The second pillar fully secures the border. That means building a great wall on the southern border, and it means hiring more heroes, like [PERSON], to keep our communities safe. Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country, and it finally ends the horrible and dangerous practice of catch and release. The third pillar ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of [NORP] people. It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system, one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country. The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security and for the future of [GPE]. In [DATE], [CARDINAL] terrorist attacks in [GPE] were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can just no longer afford. It is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into [DATE]. These [CARDINAL] pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system. For [DATE], [ORG] has tried and failed to solve this problem. This [ORG] can be the one that finally makes it happen. Most importantly, these [CARDINAL] pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that puts [GPE] first. So let us come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done. These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction. Never before has it been like it is now. It is terrible. We have to do something about it. In [DATE], we lost [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [NORP] to drug overdoses - [CARDINAL] deaths per day; [CARDINAL] per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge. My administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt. The struggle will be long and it will be difficult, but as [NORP] always do - in the end, we will succeed. We will prevail. As we have seen [TIME], the most difficult challenges bring out the best in [GPE]. We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the [PERSON] family of [GPE]. [PERSON] is [DATE], an officer with [ORG]. He is here [TIME] with his wife [PERSON]. Thank you, [PERSON]. [DATE], [PERSON] was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin. When [PERSON] told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she did not know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby. In that moment, [PERSON] said he felt God speak to him: You will do it, because you can. He heard those words. He took out a picture of his wife and their [CARDINAL] kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife [PERSON]. In an instant, she agreed to adopt. The [PERSON] named their new daughter [PERSON]. [PERSON] and [PERSON], you embody the goodness of our nation. Thank you. Thank you, [PERSON] and [PERSON]. As we rebuild [GPE]'s strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad. Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like [GPE] and [GPE] that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values. In confronting these horrible dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense. For this reason, I am asking [ORG] to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military. As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression by any other nation or anyone else. Perhaps someday in the future, there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not there yet, sadly. [DATE], I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish [ORG] from the face of the Earth. [DATE], I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat [ORG] has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in [GPE] and in [GPE] and in other locations, as well. But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until [ORG] is defeated. [ORG] Staff Sergeant [PERSON] is here [TIME]. Near [GPE], [DATE], [PERSON] and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer [PERSON], were on a mission to clear buildings that [ORG] had rigged with explosive so that civilians could return to that city hopefully soon, and hopefully safely. Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, [PERSON] was severely wounded by an explosion. Immediately, [PERSON] bounded into the booby-trapped and unbelievably dangerous and unsafe building, and found [PERSON], but in very, very bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for [TIME] during the ground transport, and maintained artificial respiration through [TIME] and through emergency surgery. [PERSON] would have died if it were not for [PERSON]'s selfless love for his fellow warrior. [TIME], [PERSON] is recovering in [GPE]. [GPE] is liberated. And [PERSON] is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a V for valor. Staff Sergeant [PERSON], all of [GPE] salutes you. Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When possible, we have no choice but to annihilate them. When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: Terrorists are not merely criminals. They are unlawful enemy combatants. And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are. In the past, we have foolishly released [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield - including the [ORG] leader, [PERSON], who we captured, who we had, who we released. So [DATE], I am keeping another promise. I just signed, prior to walking in, an order directing Secretary [PERSON], who is doing a great job, thank you - - to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities in [FAC]. I am asking [ORG] to ensure that, in the fight against [ORG] and [ORG], we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists, wherever we chase them down, wherever we find them. And in many cases, for them, it will now be [FAC]. At the same time, as of [DATE], our warriors in [GPE] have new rules of engagement. Along with their heroic [NORP] partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans. [DATE], I also took an action endorsed unanimously by [ORG] [DATE]. I recognized [GPE] as the capital of [GPE]. Shortly afterwards, [CARDINAL] of countries voted in [ORG] against [GPE]'s sovereign right to make this decision. In [DATE], [NORP] taxpayers generously sent those same countries more than $20 billion in aid. That is why, [TIME], I am asking [ORG] to pass legislation to help ensure [NORP] foreign-assistance dollars always serve [NORP] interests, and only go to friends of [GPE], not enemies of [GPE]. As we strengthen friendships all around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries. When the people of [GPE] rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. [GPE] stands with the people of [GPE] in their courageous struggle for freedom. I am asking [ORG] to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible [GPE] nuclear deal. My administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in [GPE] and [GPE]. But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in [GPE]. [GPE] reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening. Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position. We need only look at the depraved character of the [NORP] regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to [GPE] and to our allies. [PERSON] was a hardworking student at [ORG] - and a great student he was. On his way to study abroad in Asia, [PERSON] joined a tour to [GPE]. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced [PERSON] to [DATE] of hard labor, before returning him to [GPE] [DATE], horribly injured and on the verge of death. He passed away just days after his return. [PERSON]'s wonderful parents, [PERSON] and [PERSON], are here with us [TIME], along with [PERSON]'s brother and sister, [PERSON] and [PERSON]. Please. Incredible people. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength truly inspires us all. Thank you very much. Thank you. [TIME], we pledge to honor [PERSON]'s memory with total [NORP] resolve. Thank you. Finally, we are joined by [CARDINAL] more witness to the ominous nature of this regime. His name is Mr. [PERSON]. In [DATE], [PERSON] was a starving boy in [GPE]. One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food, which were very hard to get. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt. His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves, permanently stunting their own growth. Later, he was tortured by [NORP] authorities after returning from a brief visit to [GPE]. His tormentors wanted to know if he'd met any [NORP]. He had - and he resolved, after that, to be free. [PERSON] traveled [QUANTITY] on crutches all across [GPE] and Southeast Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape and was tortured to death. [DATE] he lives in [GPE], where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into [GPE] what the regime fears most: the truth. [DATE], he has a new leg. But, [PERSON], I understand you still keep those old crutches as a reminder of how far you have come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all. Please. Thank you. [PERSON] story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom. It was that same yearning for freedom that [DATE] gave birth to a special place called [GPE]. It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness. It was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves; that they could chart their own destiny; and that, together, they could light up the entire world. That is what our country has always been about. That is what [NORP] have always stood for, always strived for, and always done. Atop the dome of this [FAC] stands the Statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought, and lived, and died to protect her. Monuments to [PERSON], and [PERSON], and [PERSON], and [PERSON]. Memorials to the heroes of [GPE] and [GPE]; to young [NORP] who shed their blood on the shores of [GPE] and the fields beyond; and others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies all over Asia. And freedom stands tall over [CARDINAL] more monument: this one. This [ORG] - this living monument - this is the moment to the [NORP] people. We are a people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us, defending hope, pride, and defending the [NORP] way. They work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. And they are strong moms and brave kids. They are firefighters, and police officers, and border agents, medics, and [NORP]. But above all else, they are [NORP]. And this [FAC], this city, this nation, belongs entirely to them. Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them. [NORP] fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of science and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should never, ever forget: The people dreamed this country. The people built this country. And it is the people who are making [GPE] great again. As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve. As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will never fail. Our families will thrive. Our people will prosper. And our nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free. Thank you. And God bless [GPE]. [TIME].", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "trumpwhitehousearchivesgovbriefingsstatementsremarkspresidenttrumpnationalassemblyrepublickoreaseoulrepublickorea", "text": "[ORG] Speaker [PERSON], distinguished members of this [ORG], ladies and gentlemen: Thank you for the extraordinary privilege to speak in this great chamber and to address your people on behalf of the people of [GPE]. In our short time in your country, [PERSON] and I have been awed by its ancient and modern wonders, and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome. [TIME], President and Mrs. [PERSON] showed us incredible hospitality in a beautiful reception at [FAC]. We had productive discussions on increasing military cooperation and improving the trade relationship between our nations on the principle of fairness and reciprocity. Through this entire visit, it has been both our pleasure and our honor to create and celebrate a long friendship between [GPE] and [GPE]. This alliance between our nations was forged in the crucible of war, and strengthened by the trials of history. From the [GPE] landings to Pork Chop Hill, [NORP] and [NORP] soldiers have fought together, sacrificed together, and triumphed together. [DATE], in [DATE], they recaptured what remained of this city where we are gathered so proudly [DATE]. It was the second time in [DATE] that our combined forces took on steep casualties to retake this capital from the [NORP]. Over [DATE] and [DATE], the men soldiered through steep mountains and bloody, bloody battles. Driven back at times, they willed their way north to form the line that [DATE] divides the oppressed and the free. And there, [NORP] and [NORP] troops have remained together holding that line for [DATE]. By the time the armistice was signed in [DATE], [CARDINAL] 000 [NORP] had died in the Korean War, with [CARDINAL] 000 others very badly wounded. They are heroes, and we honor them. We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of your country paid for their freedom. You lost [CARDINAL] of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war. Much of this great city of [GPE] was reduced to rubble. Large portions of the country were scarred - severely, severely hurt - by this horrible war. The economy of this nation was demolished. But as the entire world knows, over [DATE] something miraculous happened on the southern [CARDINAL] of this peninsula. Family by family, city by city, the people of [GPE] built this country into what is [DATE] [CARDINAL] of the great nations of the world. And I congratulate you. In [DATE], [GPE] climbed from total devastation to among the wealthiest nations on Earth. [DATE], your economy is [CARDINAL] times larger than what it was in [DATE]. Trade has increased [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] times. Life expectancy has risen from [DATE] to [DATE] [DATE]. Like [GPE], and since my election [DATE], I celebrate with you. [GPE] is going through something of a miracle itself. Our stock market is at an all-time high. Unemployment is at a [DATE] low. We are defeating [ORG]. We are strengthening our judiciary, including a brilliant [ORG] justice, and on, and on, and on. Currently stationed in the vicinity of this peninsula are the [CARDINAL] largest aircraft carriers in the world loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets. In addition, we have nuclear submarines appropriately positioned. [GPE], under my administration, is completely rebuilding its military and is spending [MONEY] to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world being built, right now. I want peace through strength. We are helping [GPE] far beyond what any other country has ever done. And, in the end, we will work things out far better than anybody understands or can even appreciate. I know that [GPE], which has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a faithful ally of [GPE] very long into the future. What you have built is truly an inspiration. Your economic transformation was linked to a political one. The proud, sovereign, and independent people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves. You secured free parliamentary elections in [DATE], [DATE] you hosted your first Olympics. after, you elected your first civilian president in [DATE]. And when the [ORG] you won faced financial crisis, you lined up by the [CARDINAL] to give your most prized possessions - your wedding rings, heirlooms, and gold luck keys - to restore the promise of a better future for your children. Your wealth is measured in more than money - it is measured in achievements of the mind and achievements of spirit. Over [DATE], your scientists of engineers - have engineered so many magnificent things. You have pushed the boundaries of technology, pioneered miraculous medical treatments, and emerged as leaders in unlocking the mysteries of our universe. [NORP] authors penned [CARDINAL], 000 books [DATE]. [NORP] musicians fill concert halls all around the world. Young [NORP] students graduate from college at the highest rates of any country. And [NORP] golfers are some of the best on Earth. Fact - and you know what I am going to say - the Women's U.S. Open was held [DATE] at [SPEAKER] National Golf Club in [GPE], [GPE], and it just happened to be won by a great [NORP] golfer, [PERSON]. [CARDINAL] of the top [CARDINAL] players were from [GPE]. And the top [CARDINAL] golfers - [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] - the top [CARDINAL] were from [GPE]. Congratulations. Congratulations. And that is something. That is really something. Here in [GPE], architectural wonders like [FAC] and [FAC] - very beautiful - grace the sky and house the workers of many growing industries. Citizens now help to feed the hungry, fight terrorism, and solve problems all over the world. And in [DATE], you will host the world and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games. Good luck. The [NORP] miracle extends exactly as far as the armies of free nations advanced in [DATE] - [QUANTITY] to the north. There, it stops; it all comes to an end. Dead stop. The flourishing ends, and the prison state of [GPE] sadly begins. Workers in [GPE] labor grueling [TIME] in unbearable conditions for almost no pay. Recently, the entire working population was ordered to work for [DATE] straight, or else pay for [DATE] of rest. Families live in homes without plumbing, and [CARDINAL] have electricity. Parents bribe teachers in hopes of saving their sons and daughters from forced labor. [CARDINAL] [NORP] died of famine in [DATE], and more continue to die of hunger [DATE]. Among children under [DATE], [PERCENT] of afflicted - and are afflicted by stunted growth due to malnutrition. And yet, in [DATE] and [DATE], the regime spent [MONEY] - or [CARDINAL] the money that it allocated to improve living standards for its people - to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators. What remains of the meager harvest of the [NORP] economy is distributed according to perceived loyalty to a twisted regime. Far from valuing its people as equal citizens, this cruel dictatorship measures them, scores them, and ranks them based on the most arbitrary indications of their allegiance to the state. Those who score the highest in loyalty may live in the capital city. Those who score the lowest starve. A small infraction by [CARDINAL] citizen, such as accidently staining a picture of the tyrant printed in a discarded newspaper, can wreck the social credit rank of his entire family for [DATE]. [CARDINAL] [NORP] suffer in gulags, toiling in forced labor, and enduring torture, starvation, rape, and murder on a constant basis. In [CARDINAL] known instance, a [DATE] boy was imprisoned for [DATE] because his grandfather was accused of treason. In another, a student was beaten in school for forgetting a single detail about the life of [PERSON]. Soldiers have kidnapped foreigners and forced them to work as language tutors for [NORP] spies. In the part of [GPE] that was a stronghold for [ORG] before the war, [NORP] and other people of faith who are found praying or holding a religious book of any kind are now detained, tortured, and in many cases, even executed. [NORP] women are forced to abort babies that are considered ethnically inferior. And if these babies are born, the newborns are murdered. [CARDINAL] woman's baby born to a [NORP] father was taken away in a bucket. The guards said it did not deserve to live because it was impure. So why would [GPE] feel an obligation to help [GPE]? The horror of life in [GPE] is so complete that citizens pay bribes to government officials to have themselves exported aboard as slaves. They would rather be slaves than live in [GPE]. To attempt to flee is a crime punishable by death. [CARDINAL] person who escaped remarked, When I think about it now, I was not a human being. I was more like an animal. Only after leaving [GPE] did I realize what life was supposed to be. And so, on this peninsula, we have watched the results of a tragic experiment in a laboratory of history. It is a tale of [CARDINAL] people, but [CARDINAL] [NORP]. [CARDINAL] [GPE] in which the people took control of their lives and their country, and chose a future of freedom and justice, of civilization, and incredible achievement. And another [GPE] in which leaders imprison their people under the banner of tyranny, fascism, and oppression. The result of this experiment are in, and they are totally conclusive. When the Korean War began in [DATE], the [CARDINAL] [NORP] were approximately equal in GDP per capita. But by [DATE], [GPE] wealth had surpassed [GPE] by [CARDINAL] times. And [DATE], the [GPE]'s economy is [CARDINAL] times larger. You started the same a short while ago, and now you are [CARDINAL] times larger. You are doing something right. Considering the misery wrought by the [NORP] dictatorship, it is no surprise that it has been forced to take increasingly desperate measures to prevent its people from understanding this brutal contrast. Because the regime fears the truth above all else, it forbids virtually all contact with the outside world. Not just my speech [DATE], but even the most commonplace facts of [NORP] life are forbidden knowledge to the [NORP] people. Western and [NORP] music is banned. Possession of foreign media is a crime punishable by death. Citizens spy on fellow citizens, their homes are subject to search at any time, and their every action is subject to surveillance. In place of a vibrant society, the people of [GPE] are bombarded by state propaganda [TIME] of the day. [GPE] is a country ruled as a cult. At the center of this military cult is a deranged belief in the leader's destiny to rule as parent protector over a conquered Korean Peninsula and an enslaved [NORP] people. The more successful [GPE] becomes, the more decisively you discredit the dark fantasy at the heart of the [PERSON] regime. In this way, the very existence of a thriving [NORP] republic threatens the very survival of the [NORP] dictatorship. This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and independent [GPE] not only can, but does stand strong, sovereign, and proud among the nations of the world. Here, the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a tyrant. It comes from the true and powerful glory of a strong and great people - the people of [GPE] - a [NORP] people who are free to live, to flourish, to worship, to love, to build, and to grow their own destiny. In this Republic, the people have done what no dictator ever could - you took, with the help of [GPE], responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future. You had a dream - a [NORP] dream - and you built that dream into a great reality. In so doing, you performed the miracle on the [PERSON] that we see all around us, from the stunning skyline of [GPE] to the plains and peaks of this beautiful landscape. You have done it freely, you have done it happily, and you have done it in your own very beautiful way. This reality - this wonderful place - your success is the greatest cause of anxiety, alarm, and even panic to the [NORP] regime. That is why the [PERSON] regime seeks conflict abroad - to distract from total failure that they suffer at home. Since the so-called armistice, there have been [CARDINAL] of [NORP] attacks on [NORP] and [NORP]. These attacks have included the capture and torture of the brave [NORP] soldiers of the USS Pueblo, repeated assaults on [NORP] helicopters, and the [DATE] drowning [downing] of a [GPE] surveillance plane that killed [CARDINAL] [NORP] servicemen. The regime has made numerous lethal incursions in [GPE], attempted to assassinate senior leaders, attacked [NORP] ships, and tortured [PERSON], ultimately leading to that fine young man's death. All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with the deluded hope that it could blackmail its way to the ultimate objective. And that objective we are not going to let it have. We are not going to let it have. All of [GPE] is under that spell, divided in [CARDINAL]. [GPE] will never allow what is going on in [GPE] to continue to happen. The [NORP] regime has pursued its nuclear and ballistic missile programs in defiance of every assurance, agreement, and commitment it has made to [GPE] and its allies. It is broken all of those commitments. After promising to freeze its plutonium program in [DATE], it repeated [reaped] the benefits of the deal and then - and then immediately continued its illicit nuclear activities. In [DATE], after [DATE] of diplomacy, the dictatorship agreed to ultimately abandon its nuclear programs and return to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation. But it never did. And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to give up. In [DATE], [GPE] gave negotiations yet another chance, and offered [GPE] the open hand of engagement. The regime responded by sinking a [NORP] Navy ship, killing [CARDINAL] [NORP] sailors. To [DATE], it continues to launch missiles over the sovereign territory of [GPE] and all other neighbors, test nuclear devices, and develop ICBMs to threaten [GPE] itself. The regime has interpreted [GPE]'s past restraint as weakness. This would be a fatal miscalculation. This is a very different administration than [GPE] has had in the past. [DATE], I hope I speak not only for our countries, but for all civilized nations, when I say to the North: Do not underestimate us, and do not try us. We will defend our common security, our shared prosperity, and our sacred liberty. We did not choose to draw here, on this peninsula - - this magnificent peninsula - the thin line of civilization that runs around the world and down through time. But here it was drawn, and here it remains to [DATE]. It is the line between peace and war, between decency and depravity, between law and tyranny, between hope and total despair. It is a line that has been drawn many times, in many places, throughout history. To hold that line is a choice free nations have always had to make. We have learned together the high cost of weakness and the high stakes of its defense. [GPE]'s men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against [NORP], imperialism, [ORG] and terrorism. [GPE] does not seek conflict or confrontation, but we will never run from it. History is filled with discarded regimes that have foolishly tested [GPE]'s resolve. Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of [GPE] should look to our past, and you will doubt it no longer. We will not permit [GPE] or our allies to be blackmailed or attacked. We will not allow [NORP] cities to be threatened with destruction. We will not be intimidated. And we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here, on this ground, we fought and died so hard to secure. That is why I have come here, to the heart of a free and flourishing [GPE], with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world: The time for excuses is over. Now is the time for strength. If you want peace, you must stand strong at all times. The world cannot tolerate the menace of a rogue regime that threatens with nuclear devastation. All responsible nations must join forces to isolate the brutal regime of [GPE] - to deny it and any form - any form of it. You cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. We call on every nation, including [GPE] and [GPE], to fully implement [ORG] resolutions, downgrade diplomatic relations with the regime, and sever all ties of trade and technology. It is our responsibility and our duty to confront this danger together - because the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows, and the fewer the options become. And to those nations that choose to ignore this threat, or, worse still, to enable it, the weight of this crisis is on your conscience. I also have come here to this peninsula to deliver a message directly to the leader of the [NORP] dictatorship: The weapons you are acquiring are not making you safer. They are putting your regime in grave danger. Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face. [GPE] is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned. It is a hell that no person deserves. Yet, despite every crime you have committed against God and man, you are ready to offer, and we will do that - we will offer a path to a much better future. It begins with an end to the aggression of your regime, a stop to your development of ballistic missiles, and complete, verifiable, and total denuclearization. A sky-top view of this peninsula shows a nation of dazzling light in the South and a mass of impenetrable darkness in the North. We seek a future of light, prosperity, and peace. But we are only prepared to discuss this brighter path for [GPE] if its leaders cease their threats and dismantle their nuclear program. The sinister regime of [GPE] is right about [CARDINAL] thing: The [NORP] people do have a glorious destiny, but they could not be more wrong about what that destiny looks like. The destiny of the [NORP] people is not to suffer in the bondage of oppression, but to thrive in the glory of freedom. What [NORP] have achieved on this peninsula is more than a victory for your nation. It is a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. And it is our hope that, someday soon, all of your brothers and sisters of the North will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God. Your republic shows us all of what is possible. In [DATE], with only the hard work, courage, and talents of your people, you turned this war-torn land into a nation blessed with wealth, rich in culture, and deep in spirit. You built a home where all families can flourish and where all children can shine and be happy. This [GPE] stands strong and tall among the great community of independent, confident, and peace-loving nations. We are nations that respect our citizens, cherish our liberty, treasure our sovereignty, and control our own destiny. We affirm the dignity of every person and embrace the full potential of every soul. And we are always prepared to defend the vital interests of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants. Together, we dream of a [GPE] that is free, a peninsula that is safe, and families that are reunited once again. We dream of highways connecting North and South, of cousins embracing cousins, and this nuclear nightmare replaced with the beautiful promise of peace. Until [DATE] comes, we stand strong and alert. Our eyes are fixed to the [GPE], and our hearts praying for [DATE] when all [NORP] can live in freedom. Thank you. God Bless You. God Bless the [NORP] people. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksdeliveringpolicyspeechabortionarlingtonvirginia", "text": "Thank you, [PERSON]. And thank you to [ORG] for its tireless work on behalf of innocent children and moms. My subject [DATE] is the conversation around abortion. It is a sensitive topic that deserves our attention. It is one that too many politicians either demagogue or hide from. I will not demagogue or hide from it. I am here to speak about it directly and openly. I will not address every possible question or angle. Rather, I aim to start a constructive conversation about where we go from here in our divided country. Abortion is a deeply personal topic for both women and men. I understand why. Someone's body and someone else's life are not things to be taken lightly, and they should not be politicized. The issue should be addressed with sensitivity and respect, not judgment and hate. Most people have a story that has brought them to their views about abortion. It could be a personal experience. It could be a trauma that a family member or friend endured. It could be a moral conviction. It could be our concerns for our daughters and their future. This is my story. I am pro-life. I am unapologetic and unhesitant about it. Not because [ORG] tells me to be. But for very personal reasons. My husband was adopted, and I am reminded of that blessing [DATE]. [PERSON]'s birth parents lived in poverty. His father was an alcoholic and in and out of prison. His mother suffered a traumatic brain injury. When he was just [DATE], [PERSON] and his siblings were taken from their home. Later, they were put in foster care. It was a rough experience for him. Thankfully, when he was [DATE], a loving family adopted [PERSON] and his younger sister. It changed their lives. Adoption literally saved them. [DATE] is a blessing because someone gave him life. [DATE] is a blessing because a family loved and raised him under difficult circumstances. The world is better because of [PERSON]. He is an amazing father and husband. He is a combat veteran who served our country in war. He continues to help adoption and at-risk youth causes because he wants to help others who were born in his situation. I often think about what would have happened if [PERSON] had not been so blessed if his biological mother had chosen a different path. My husband is reason [CARDINAL] that I stand for life. Every day I get to spend with the love of my life reminds me that I am blessed that someone saved his life. The second reason is that [PERSON] and I struggled to have children of our own. I had many challenges as a teenager into [DATE]. I went through numerous surgeries. When [PERSON] and I were married, I could not wait to be a mom. But what happened so easily for many of my friends was not my path. We went through countless sessions of fertility treatments. Every day I wake up and see or speak to my [CARDINAL] children I feel blessed. The greatest job I will ever have is being their mom. Our eldest got married [DATE]. I will never forget [DATE] she was born and then seeing her walk down the wedding aisle with her dad. I felt what countless parents feel. Love. Pride. Overpowering joy. I believe every life is a blessing from God. My heart hurts when someone decides not to go through with a pregnancy. My record on abortion is long and clear. As a state legislator, I voted for every pro-life bill that came before me. We made it easier for women to get ultrasounds. We required a [TIME] wait before abortions. As Governor, we passed the Born Alive Infant Protection Act, protecting babies born during botched abortions. I signed a law protecting unborn babies from the moment they can feel pain. We also launched initiatives that paired [CARDINAL] of vulnerable first-time moms with nurses who had specialized training in maternal and child health. I kept up the fight as ambassador to [ORG]. And I am not done yet. My goal as president will be the same as when I was Governor and Ambassador. I want to save as many lives and help as many moms as possible. This mission has become more urgent in [DATE]. With [ORG] [PERSON] decision, we entered a new era. It is really a return to the way this issue was decided in our country for [DATE]. Until [DATE], abortion was not a federal issue. Each state decided where it stood. Many had restrictive laws. Some had more permissive laws. Yes, the issue was controversial, but the citizens of each state reached a consensus that reflected their values. Then, in [DATE], [ORG] changed that. It declared the entire nation must follow [CARDINAL] standard. A standard determined not by the [NORP] people, but by unelected judges. And that standard was among the most liberal in the world. [TIME], [CARDINAL] states saw their abortion laws thrown out. State-level consensus was replaced with a national mandate that much of the country found deeply offensive. [DATE], the [ORG] returned power to the [NORP] people. We are now free to forge consensus once again. In [DATE], we have started to see what that looks like. Some states have passed laws protecting life. I commend them for it. Other states have doubled down on abortion. I wish that were not the case, but it is. Different people in different places are taking different paths. That is what the founders of our country envisioned. It is the reality of living in a democracy. But it is equally true that in a democracy, things can change. [DATE] can be better than [DATE]. And I believe we will make even more progress in the cause of life. That is the challenge we face as pro-life advocates - to move [GPE] toward life. I said I want to save as many lives and help as many moms as possible. That is my goal. To do that at the federal level, the next president must find national consensus. That might sound strange to many people. Under Roe, consensus was replaced by demonization. And let us be honest: most in the media promote demonization. They stoke division pitting [NORP] against each other. No one talks about finding consensus. Everyone goes to the barricades and attacks the other side. They have turned a sensitive issue that has long divided people into a kind of gotcha bidding war. How many [DATE] are you for? How many exceptions are you for? And so on. But these questions miss the point if the goal is saving as many lives as possible. You do not save any lives if you cannot enact your position into law. And you cannot do that unless you find consensus. Reaching consensus starts with humanizing, not demonizing. Just like I have my story, I respect everyone who has their story. I do not judge someone who is pro-choice any more than I want them to judge me for being pro-life. [DATE], each state is finding its own consensus, as they should. Nationally, however, the task is much harder. As a practical matter, you only achieve consensus when you have a [ORG] majority, a [CARDINAL]-vote [ORG] majority, and a president who are all in alignment. We are nowhere close to reaching that point. [DATE], there are [CARDINAL] pro-life senators, depending on how you count them. There have not been [CARDINAL] [NORP] senators since [DATE]. It could happen [DATE]. But it has not happened in [DATE], and it is unlikely to happen soon. We have to face this reality. The pro-life laws that have passed in strongly [NORP] states will not be approved at the federal level. That is just a fact, notwithstanding what the [NORP] fearmongers say. They say [NORP] are about to ban all abortions nationwide and send women to prison. These wildly false claims, amplified by a sympathetic media, are not designed to do anything other than score political points. They know as well as anyone that no [NORP] president will have the ability to ban abortion nationwide, just as no [NORP] president can override the laws of all [CARDINAL] states. It is just not going to happen. But that does not mean we cannot save as many lives as possible. I do believe there is a federal role on abortion. Whether we can save more lives nationally depends entirely on doing what no one has done to date - finding consensus. That is what I will strive to do. In fact, I believe common ground already exists. There is broad public agreement that babies born during a failed abortion deserve to live. They need medical care and the full protection of the law, just like every other baby. There is broad public agreement that we should never pressure moms into having an abortion. They should get support to carry their baby to term. They should be able to get information from pregnancy resource centers - and especially about adoption. We must do better when it comes to adoption, to make it easier for adoptive parents, and to avoid children growing up in a government system with too little love. We can broadly agree that pro-life doctors and nurses should never be forced to violate their beliefs. The right of conscience matters just as much as the right to life. Surely, we can all agree that abortion up until the time of birth is a bridge too far. [CARDINAL] countries on earth allow elective late-term abortions. We are talking brutal regimes like [NORP] [GPE] and [GPE]. We should be able to agree that contraception should be more available, not less. And we can all agree that women who get abortions should not be jailed. A few have even called for the death penalty. That is the least pro-life position I can possibly imagine. Those are just some areas where national consensus is already within reach. There are others too, and we should do the hard work to find them through heartfelt dialogue. Sadly, finding consensus is the last thing on the mind of many of [DATE]'s political and media class. Conflict makes for good fundraising copy and scary TV ads. Consensus does not get a lot of ratings or clicks. Hating and judging each other has become the norm instead of respecting one's personal story. I would remind those on the Left who demonize anyone who is pro-life, that it was not too long ago when President [PERSON] said he wanted abortion to be safe, legal, and rare. Few [NORP] say rare anymore. Just the opposite. Many want legal abortion anytime, for any reason, at any stage of pregnancy, in every state and town in [GPE]. Some radical activists are even lighting pregnancy resource centers on fire. These are not the voices of consensus. They are acts of division and hatred. President [PERSON] has done nothing to discourage it. In fact, he promotes it. That is not leadership. It is more partisanship of the worst kind. Pro-life political leaders and candidates must not put up with being demonized. We should call out the extremism of the Left. We do not need a president who endangers lives while dividing our country even more. We need a president who unites [NORP] and brings out the best in them, even on the toughest of subjects. That will be my approach as president. I believe in conversation. I believe in compassion. I believe in empathy, not anger. We are not just talking about policy here. We are talking about people. That is often lost in this debate, on the left and the right. But it is front of mind for me. I acknowledge the humanity of both the unborn baby and the pregnant mom. I know how hard pregnancy can be. [DATE], you are so sick you cannot get out of bed. You worry if you are really up for raising a baby. And you know you are going to need a lot of help. That is what I felt during my pregnancies. Many women have it much harder. I desperately wanted a child. I had a loving family eager to help out. But some moms never wanted to be pregnant at all. Some are single with no one to help - with no idea how to raise a baby while keeping a job. I had a friend who was raped. I know the anguish she went through worrying that she would have an unwanted pregnancy. It was an anguish I would not wish on anyone. We cannot ignore the fears those women face. I will never downplay these difficulties as I fight for life. And I will not demonize those who disagree with me. We cannot give into outrage culture and accuse our opponents of being evil. That is self- defeating. If we want to protect more moms and save more babies, we need more [NORP] to join with us. We must persuade people and find consensus, not push them further away. I know we can do it. I have done it before. [DATE], when I was governor, I encountered the most difficult challenge of my life. A sick and twisted young man walked into [ORG], in [GPE]. He joined a bible study of [NORP], sat and prayed with them for [TIME], then opened fire. He murdered [CARDINAL] amazing souls. He openly said he did it because of the color of their skin. In [DATE] that followed, photos emerged of the killer posing with the Confederate Flag. Amid our grief, a massive debate broke out. It centered on the Confederate Flag that flew on the grounds of the [GPE] statehouse. Our state had been bitterly divided on the flag for [DATE]. On [CARDINAL] side were those who wanted to tear it down. On the other side were those who wanted to keep the flag. Both were united in sadness over the [ORG] murders. But they were divided about what the flag meant, and what taking it down would mean. The debate was intense. People wondered if [GPE] would break out in violence and destruction like what we had recently seen in [GPE], [GPE] and other places. But we did not . In that fraught moment, I gave a speech. I said, quote: For many people in our state, the flag stands for traditions that are noble - traditions of history, of heritage and of ancestry At the same time, for many others in [GPE], the flag is a deeply offensive symbol of a brutally oppressive past. As a state, we can survive, as we have done, while still being home to both of those viewpoints. We do not need to declare a winner and loser. And so, I said, it was time to remove the Confederate Flag from the statehouse grounds. This was no easy task. It was a highly emotional issue in our state. And removal required a [CARDINAL] vote in both our [ORG] and [ORG]. But [DATE], large, diverse, and bipartisan majorities in our state legislature voted to bring down the flag. We found consensus on a very tough issue. [NORP] and [NORP] worked together and made progress by talking to each other like human beings. We saw past our differences, and united to move forward, as [CARDINAL] state and [CARDINAL] people. What was true then, with the flag, can be true now, with abortion. This should not be about [CARDINAL] movement winning, and another one losing. This should not be about picking sides, scoring points, or stoking outrage. It is about saving babies and supporting moms. I am fighting for all of them, and I will work with anyone to do that. I have faith we can make progress. I have faith we can save more lives, and give every baby, mother, and family the best shot at the best life. Our national history should give us hope. Time and again, the [NORP] people have confronted great wrongs, and worked hard to convince their fellow citizens to make them right. Think back to the abolitionists. They spent the better part of [DATE] striving to end our original sin of slavery. Think back to the suffragettes. It took them even longer to secure the support of their fellow citizens for women's right to vote. Think back to the leaders of the civil rights movement. Their tireless work showed [GPE] that segregation was wrong, and equality was right. Think about the progress we are already making in the restoration of the right to life. [DATE], a court forced unlimited abortion on an unwilling nation. [CARDINAL] of [NORP] responded - not with rage, but with resolve. They reminded our fellow citizens about the humanity of the unborn child and the needs of pregnant mothers. Now that power has been restored to the people. Let us treat it as the important and deeply personal issue it is. Let us discuss it in ways that allow [NORP] to show love for one another, not judgment or contempt. And let us find a consensus that allows us to save as many babies as we can while supporting women in difficult situations. I am ready for the hard work that lies ahead. And I am confident we can move together, toward our founding promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless [GPE].", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsjoebidenspeechtranscriptwarrenmichiganseptember9", "text": "It is great to be here in [GPE] and with the [ORG] auto workers. As they say, in parts of my state, I got brung up on [ORG]. My father ran a [ORG] agency. He did not own it, but he ran it and cars or cars or cars. By the way, I still have my [DATE] Corvette that is new. It was new. I still keep that, but I got to tell you, I am waiting for that electric one you just made that goes [QUANTITY], but that is a different story. Look, [DATE] and the reason we are a little bit late here, we found as I was getting off the plane, the press asked me a legitimate question that I did not have the background on because it occurred on the plane. [DATE], we celebrated [DATE]. And here in the heart of the [NORP] automobile industry, we never forget everything that we owe the unions. And unions, as you have heard me say many times, built this country. Unions built the economy. The economic engine has driven [NORP] manufacturing dynamism. And literally in the case of the auto workers, you are the ones that did it. So I want to thank you again, [ORG] region one, for hosting me [DATE]. And it is great to see Senator [PERSON]. My good friend, [PERSON]. Got a chance to spend a little time with the governor, but Senator [PERSON] and I worked together on an awful lot of matters over [DATE] in [ORG]. She was a great partner to me when I was vice president and we worked in lockstep to get the people in [GPE] back on their feet. We are joined by one of the best and brightest and hardest working governors around, my friend, [PERSON]. And if you are wondering what responsible strong executive leadership looks like in COVID-19, just look at this executive right here. Governor, you have done an incredible job steering the people of [GPE] through a turbulent time. Much of it is brought on by [PERSON] lack of leadership. You have been rock solid, governor. You have listened to the experts and you have led with science and you put the needs of the people, who are hurting first, helping them get through this crisis. Meanwhile, on [DATE] that we hit [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] dead in [GPE], because of COVID-19, we just learned from the [ORG] columnist [PERSON] that the president of [GPE] has admitted on tape in [DATE] he knew about COVID-19 that had passed through the air. He knew how deadly it was. It was much more deadly than the flu. He knew and purposely played it down. Worse, he lied to the [NORP] people. He knowingly and willingly lied about the threaded pose to the country for [DATE]. He had the information. He knew how dangerous it was. Now, while this deadly disease ripped through our nation, he failed to do his job on purpose. It was a life and death betrayal of the [NORP] people. Experts say that if he had acted just one week sooner, [CARDINAL] 000 people would have been saved. If he acted [DATE], back in [DATE], [CARDINAL] 000 lives would have been spared in [DATE] and [DATE] alone. His failure has not only costs lives. He sent our economy in a tailspin. It costs [CARDINAL] more in [NORP] livelihoods. This is a recession created by [PERSON] negligence. And he is unfit for this job as a consequence of it. How many schools are not open right now? How many kids are starting a new school year the same way they ended the last one at home? How many parents feel abandoned and overwhelmed? How many frontline workers are exhausted and pushed to the limits? And how many families are missing loved ones at their dinner table [TIME] because of his failures? It is beyond despicable. It is a dereliction of duty. It is a disgrace. We are going to hear a lot more about this. I am sure, not just from me, but from the news media and a lot of others, but I want to ask you [CARDINAL] simple question. What is the value of a promise? What is it worth? What is the worth of a woman or man's word, of a president's word, if it is not matched with action? In [DATE], then candidate [PERSON] came here to [PERSON] [DATE] before the election. Here is what he said. He said, If I am elected, you will not lose [CARDINAL] plant. You have plants coming into this country. You are going to have jobs again. You will not lose [CARDINAL] plant. I promise you. I promise you. That is what he said. [PERSON] makes a lot of promises. He promised that he alone could stop the off shoring of jobs. He promised he bring back jobs, stop companies from leaving. He could do what, Nobody else could do it, but him. Nut he promised it has administration would enforce every last buying [NORP] provision on behalf of the [NORP] people. And what makes his wild claims and hopes, he now hopes we do not notice what he said or will not remember. And when he does follow through or does not do with follow through the exact opposite, he is hoping we just have poor memories. He does not give us much credit, but the [NORP] people are smart, honest, decent, and they are hard working. And we expect our president to be straight with us, to do what he or she says they are going to do. So let us look at the reality of [PERSON] economy and what exactly his promise to the [NORP] people and workers are worth. He is on track to be the first president since [PERSON] in the Great Depression to see the number of jobs in our economy go down, not up while being president. Our economy's down [CARDINAL] jobs since he took office, [CARDINAL]. Even before President [PERSON]'s failed response to COVID-19 crashed through our economy, his reckless and chaotic trade policy had thrown [NORP] manufacturing into recession. It was already contracting in [DATE], even when COVID-19 hit, before it hit. [PERSON] was creating an average of [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] jobs fewer per year than [DATE] when President [PERSON] and I were an office. When the [ORG] transmission plant here in [GPE] close [DATE], I bet the workers around were not all that comforted by [PERSON]'s empty promises. Under [PERSON], [GPE] lost auto jobs, even before [ORG] did. And what about off shoring? Has [PERSON] delivered on stopping companies from shipping jobs overseas, [NORP] jobs? You already know the answer. Of course not. The rate of offshoring by federal contractors, there are people that get federal dollars from the federal government to do things. The off shoring, big companies being paid by [GPE] Taxpayers has doubled, doubled under [PERSON]. Those federal contracts with your tax dollars. They have doubled the number that had been off shored. He invited companies to [ORG] to make what he called the pledge to [NORP] workers. He could not even keep those firms from outsourcing. Many were given lucrative federal contracts, but then some of them turned around and shipped [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] jobs overseas. Under President [PERSON], [GPE] trade deficit has grown. It is hit an all time high. Let me say that again. [GPE] trade deficit is at an all time high under [PERSON] in [DATE]. President [PERSON]'s answered all this as the same as he is answered everything. Corporate tax giveaways that actually ward off shoring. You heard me right. Giveaways that reward offshoring. If you offshore, you get more tax breaks. His [DATE] tax bill slashed taxes on companies that sent production and jobs overseas. Those corporations then make huge profits by shipping these foreign made products back to [GPE] to sell to [NORP] consumers. And no industry has taken a greater advantage of [PERSON]'s offshoring tax loopholes than the pharmaceutical industry. Big pharma lobbied [PERSON] for a handout. That is exactly what they got from him. [GPE] pharma is building factories overseas instead of [GPE], skipping out on having to pay [GPE] taxes and then sending those same foreign made drugs back to [NORP] consumers, all while raising their prices on prescription drugs that union families and working people have to rely on. And in the process by the way, he is trying to do away with all healthcare in [GPE]. During a pandemic, we are seeing not only the inequity of this policy, but the enormous vulnerability that this creates for our own health security. And our security requires us to have supply chains of the necessary drugs based here, not overseas. Not overseas in times of crisis. And what about [PERSON]'s commitment to buy [NORP]? Like the rest of President [PERSON]'s promise it has nothing to do with reality. It is all a bunch of hot air. In fact, contracts awarded by [GPE] governments to foreign companies using [NORP] tax dollars went up [PERCENT] since he is been president. So to recap, [CARDINAL], [PERSON] has not stopped companies from closing plants and sending jobs overseas. [CARDINAL], he is rewarded companies that have cut jobs and failed to invest here at home with [MONEY] in tax breaks. And [CARDINAL], he is awarding more and more federal contracts to foreign companies. President [PERSON] has broken just about every promise he is ever made to the [NORP] worker. And he is failed. He is failed our economy and our country. But look, would you really expect anything different from this guy? From someone who called those of you and those who are serving in uniform, who have given their lives to the country losers and suckers? Let me tell you something. My son [PERSON] is an assistant [GPE] attorney. He volunteered to go to [GPE] to help them set up a government in the middle of the war. I know I am being proud here, but he is the only foreigner has a monument that they raised and built in service to him, thanking him for what he did. My son also then as attorney general volunteered to go to [GPE] for [DATE]. He was not a loser or a sucker. No one who served this nation has been a loser or a sucker. They are all heroes. Or would you expect anything different than someone who could stand next to a father of a fallen soldier and say at a cemetery and say, I do not get it. What was in it for them? What was in it for them? [PERSON] does understand what it means to serve something bigger than yourself. He does not understand duty, honor, country. He lives by a different code. Lies, selfishness, greed. Yes, [PERSON] and I have a pretty different philosophy when it comes to giving our word. Mine means something. When I tell the [NORP] people I am going to do something, I follow through. Here in [GPE], you know that is true. When [PERSON] and I took office back in [DATE], the economy was crashing. We inherited an economy in free fall. And [CARDINAL] of [NORP], including so many right here in [GPE], lost their jobs, their homes, and their savings. With the help of [PERSON] breaking her neck here, President [PERSON] and I worked hard. He put me in charge of the Recovery Act. I spent a lot of time here in [GPE] and [GPE], working with you and Senator [PERSON], and thinking [DATE] about the folks on the factory line, busting their necks, just trying to put food on the table. A lot of folks were all ready to count [GPE] out as well as the auto [NORP] industry to count it out. But I knew what [PERSON] knew. I have known always. It is never a good bet to bet against the [NORP] worker. So when we promise to stand with the [NORP] auto industry, we delivered. We did not do it to help wealthy investors or pad bonus checks for CEOs, we did it to save an iconic [NORP] industry, a testament to the skills and ingenuity of [NORP] manufacturing. And the jobs of [CARDINAL] of [NORP] workers and the lifeblood of communities all across the Midwest, and used to be in my state of [GPE] as well. When [GPE] declared bankruptcy, I was right here working alongside the city leaders to get the lights turned back on to revitalize the future of [GPE]. Well, [CARDINAL] 000 auto manufacturing jobs have been lost in [GPE] under [PERSON]. [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] were created during the [PERSON] [PERSON] administration. I have got long history. I am not just talking about what I am going to do, but delivering results for [NORP]. And now, we need to do it again. We need to do the hard work, not only to recover, but to build the economy back for the future once more. That is why my build back better agenda, that is what it is all about. Starts right here with you in the union halls, all across [GPE]. Back in [DATE], I made the first plank in my agenda a plan to modernize [NORP] manufacturing and technology to ensure that the future is made in [GPE], by all of you. And [DATE], I am announcing some additional steps to make this plank even stronger. First, we are going to impose a tax penalty on companies that avoid paying [GPE] taxes by off shoring jobs and manufacturing, only to sell those goods back to the [NORP] consumer. If your big corporate strategy is to boost your shareholders profits, your CEOs' bonuses by moving jobs out, well, we are going to make sure you not only pay full [GPE] taxes on those profits, but we are going to guarantee. We are going to add a [PERCENT] off shoring penalty surge tax to your bill. No more deductions for writing off expenses for the cost of sending jobs overseas, which is a big deal that could be done here at home by qualified [NORP] workers. I am not looking to punish [NORP] business, but there is a better way. Make it in [GPE], make it in [GPE], invest in our communities and the workers in places like [GPE]. That is what this is about. [ORG] workers, steel workers, [ORG] workers. You are the best craftsmen and women in the world. And you are right here. If you are ready to make it in [GPE], then just like there are consequences for off showing, there will be rewards and incentives for creating good paying jobs here at home. [DATE], I am announcing my new [ORG] tax credit, a [PERCENT] advanceable tax credit for companies that invest in [GPE] and [NORP] workers, to help accelerate the recovery under our build back better agenda. So if your company revitalizes a closing facility here in [GPE], like the transmission plant that got closed [DATE], we will take care of [PERCENT] of the investment that company makes to reopen it. If you retool a manufacturing facility to make it more competitive, for example, by shifting to help build a new fleet of clean [NORP] vehicles made by [ORG] members, we will make sure that is more than affordable for you. We are going to make sure you will get a tax credit. If you reshore jobs that have previously been sent overseas, expand your operations in [GPE] or increase wages for manufacturing jobs will make an even smarter strategic decision for your company because we will make sure you get a tax credit. These [CARDINAL] steps on top of my plans to close each and every one of the [PERSON] loopholes that he created in [DATE] with his tax cut to reward companies with big tax breaks for off shoring. That is going to end. If you are going to want to build things here in [GPE], because under our administration, [ORG], is going to deliver on the promise to buy [NORP]. It is been a law for [DATE], but we have never lived up to it. The idea is simple. [DATE], the [GPE] government spends [MONEY] of taxpayer's money on federal contracts [DATE]. And that money should go to support [NORP] jobs and [NORP] businesses. But President [PERSON] has only ever treated it like it was a weak suggestion. Agencies of the federal government can waive the requirements, explanations that [PERSON] does not bother even kick back on. We are going to change that when I am president. In [DATE], I will sign a series of executive actions to make sure we enforce by [GPE] and direct the full purchasing power of the federal government to fulfill his promise, starting by closing those waiver loopholes immediately. And I promise you, I will use the full power of the Defense Production Act to enforce buy [NORP] and tighten the rules for public infrastructure projects, roads, bridges, canals, airports. And I am going to crack down on companies that label products as made in [GPE], even if they are coming from [GPE] or elsewhere. We found out that on [PERSON]'s watch a company selling deployment bags to active duty troops being deployed falsely claimed this product was made in [GPE]. When in fact, it was really made mostly in [GPE]. [PERSON] did not do anything to respond. I am not going to let that happen on my watch. We are going to have an office at [ORG] dedicated to making sure everyone is playing by the same made in [GPE] rules. And [CARDINAL] more thing, when I say we are going to use the purchasing power of the federal government to reinvigorate domestic manufacturing, I mean. We are going to do that with the [NORP] automobile industry as well. [GPE] government owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles. We are going to convert those government vehicles into electric vehicles, made in [GPE], sourced right here in [GPE]. With the government providing the demand and support to retool factories that are suggesting they are struggling to compete, the [GPE] automobile industry will set up expanding the capacity in [GPE], not [GPE], to lead the world in clean energy vehicles. I cannot wait to get, I said, behind that all electric Corvette that goes [QUANTITY]. Y'all think I am kidding. I mean it. [DATE], that converted Corvette set a speed record of [QUANTITY], electric vehicle. So do not tell me we do not still make the best cars right here in [GPE], and trucks. We are going to make it easy for [NORP] consumers to switch to electric vehicles. We are going to build on all the new infrastructure we are going to build on highways. We are going to build a network of [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] charging stations across [GPE], providing prevailing wage jobs for the [ORG] and other craftsmen all across the country. And by offering rebates and incentives to swap older fuel efficient vehicles for new clean [NORP] made models, saving [QUANTITY] of oil. And together, this will mean, listen to me now, [CARDINAL] new jobs in the [NORP] automobile industry, [CARDINAL]. With supply chain, as well as the associated infrastructure, we can do this. We can do this. We can revitalize our industrial base as the heart of the [NORP] middle class. Think about the worker in [GPE] who when the transmission plant closed, he told a reporter and I am quoting him, Getting a good GM job [DATE] for me was like winning the lottery, he said. I was trying to start a family. I was able to buy a house. I went to [ORG] world, all that. Think about that. A job that felt like winning a lottery because it opened the door to a life that you wanted for yourself, because it gave you dignity, allowed you to provide for your family. Getting a good job in [DATE], right here in [GPE], should not be a lottery. It should be an absolute expectation for everyone. I do not accept the defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization mean we cannot keep good paying union jobs here in [GPE] and create more of them. I do not buy for [TIME] that the vitality of [NORP] manufacturing is a thing of the past. We have the most qualified workers in the world. [NORP] manufacturing, is the old expression you heard your grandpop say or your grandmother, was the arsenal of democracy in World War II. Well, guess what? It is going to be part of the engine of [NORP] prosperity now in [DATE], and we are going to make it happen with [NORP] grit, [NORP] determination, and [NORP] union workers. Look, folks. That is my promise to you. And keep in mind, back in [DATE], they set up the law relating to unions. It said that not you could have a union, it said the government should encourage unions to increase [inaudible 00:25:10]. You are going to have the best, most friendly union president in history of [GPE], when I am in [FAC]. I want to thank you all, for all you do. Do not give up hope. Do not give up hope. We can come back. We can come back stronger than we were before. I want to thank you all. I carry with me I do not have it. I gave it to my staff. I carry with me in my pocket Do I have that around, anyone? Where is my staff? I gave it away. Anyway, I carry a schedule in my pocket that lists [DATE] the number of troops lost in [GPE] and [GPE]. The number wounded. This is my schedule. The back of the schedule is always a black box. You cannot really see it. The press may be able to. It says [DATE] [GPE] updates. Troops died in [GPE] and [GPE], [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], not over [CARDINAL], 000, [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], is every one of those women and men left behind. An entire group of people relied on them. [GPE] troops wounded in [GPE] and [GPE], [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL]. Not over [CARDINAL]. [GPE] COVID infected in [GPE], [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL]. [GPE] COVID deaths, [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL]. Military COVID infected, [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL]. Military COVID deaths, [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL]. Folks, every [CARDINAL] of these lives matter. Every one of these lives left somebody behind grieving. We cannot ever forget them, ever, ever forget them. Thank you all. God bless you. And may God protect our troops. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}

I am honored to be received by such gracious hosts. I have always heard about the splendor of your country and the kindness of your citizens, but words do not do justice to the grandeur of this remarkable place and the incredible hospitality you have shown us from the moment we arrived. You also hosted me in the treasured home of King [PERSON], the founder of the [GPE] who united your great people. Working alongside another beloved leader - [NORP] President [PERSON] - King [PERSON] began the enduring partnership between our [CARDINAL] countries. King [PERSON]: your father would be so proud to see that you are continuing his legacy - and just as he opened the first chapter in our partnership, [DATE] we begin a new chapter that will bring lasting benefits to our citizens. Let me now also extend my deep and heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of the distinguished heads of state who made this journey here [DATE]. You greatly honor us with your presence, and I send the warmest regards from my country to yours. I know that our time together will bring many blessings to both your people and mine. I stand before you as a representative of [ORG], to deliver a message of friendship and hope. That is why I chose to make my first foreign visit a trip to the heart of the [NORP] world, to the nation that serves as custodian of the [CARDINAL] holiest sites in the Islamic Faith. In my inaugural address to the American People, I pledged to strengthen [GPE]'s oldest friendships, and to build new partnerships in pursuit of peace. I also promised that [GPE] will not seek to impose our way of life on others, but to outstretch our hands in the spirit of cooperation and trust. Our vision is one of peace, security, and prosperity-in this region, and in the world. Our goal is a coalition of nations who share the aim of stamping out extremism and providing our children a hopeful future that does honor to God. And so this historic and unprecedented gathering of leaders-unique in the history of nations-is a symbol to the world of our shared resolve and our mutual respect. To the leaders and citizens of every country assembled here [DATE], I want you to know that [GPE] is eager to form closer bonds of friendship, security, culture and commerce. For [NORP], this is an exciting time. A new spirit of optimism is sweeping our country: in [DATE], we have created [CARDINAL] new jobs, added [MONEY] of new value, lifted the burdens on [NORP] industry, and made record investments in our military that will protect the safety of our people and enhance the security of our wonderful friends and allies - many of whom are here [DATE]. Now, there is even more blessed news I am pleased to share with you. My meetings with King [PERSON], the Crown Prince, and the Deputy Crown Prince, have been filled with great warmth, good will, and tremendous cooperation. [DATE], we signed historic agreements with the [GPE] that will invest [MONEY] in our [CARDINAL] countries and create many [CARDINAL] of jobs in [GPE] and [GPE]. This landmark agreement includes the announcement of a [MONEY] [NORP]-funded defense purchase - and we will be sure to help our [NORP] friends to get a good deal from our great [NORP] defense companies. This agreement will help the [NORP] military to take a greater role in security operations. We have also started discussions with many of the countries present [DATE] on strengthening partnerships, and forming new ones, to advance security and stability across the Middle East and beyond. [DATE], we will make history again with the opening of a new [ORG] - located right here, in this central part of the Islamic World. This groundbreaking new center represents a clear declaration that [NORP]-majority countries must take the lead in combatting radicalization, and I want to express our gratitude to King [PERSON] for this strong demonstration of leadership. I have had the pleasure of welcoming several of the leaders present [DATE] to [FAC], and I look forward to working with all of you. [GPE] is a sovereign nation and our first priority is always the safety and security of our citizens. We are not here to lecture-we are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be, or how to worship. Instead, we are here to offer partnership - based on shared interests and values - to pursue a better future for us all. Here at this summit we will discuss many interests we share together. But above all we must be united in pursuing the one goal that transcends every other consideration. That goal is to meet history's great test-to conquer extremism and vanquish the forces of terrorism. Young [NORP] boys and girls should be able to grow up free from fear, safe from violence, and innocent of hatred. And young [NORP] men and women should have the chance to build a new era of prosperity for themselves and their peoples. God's help, this summit will mark the beginning of the end for those who practice terror and spread its vile creed. At the same time, we pray this special gathering may someday be remembered as the beginning of peace in the Middle East - and maybe, even all over the world. But this future can only be achieved through defeating terrorism and the ideology that drives it. Few nations have been spared its violent reach. [GPE] has suffered repeated barbaric attacks - from the atrocities of September 11th to the devastation of the Boston Bombing, to the horrible killings in [GPE] and [GPE]. The nations of Europe have also endured unspeakable horror. So too have the nations of Africa and even South America. [GPE], [GPE], [GPE] and [GPE] have been victims. But, in sheer numbers, the deadliest toll has been exacted on the innocent people of [NORP], [NORP] and [NORP] nations. They have borne the brunt of the killings and the worst of the destruction in this wave of fanatical violence. Some estimates hold that [PERCENT] of the victims of terrorism are themselves [NORP]. We now face a humanitarian and security disaster in this region that is spreading across the planet. It is a tragedy of epic proportions. No description of the suffering and depravity can begin to capture its full measure. The true toll of [ORG], [ORG], [ORG], [ORG], and so many others, must be counted not only in the number of dead. It must also be counted in generations of vanished dreams. The Middle East is rich with natural beauty, vibrant cultures, and massive amounts of historic treasures. It should increasingly become one of the great global centers of commerce and opportunity. This region should not be a place from which refugees flee, but to which newcomers flock. [GPE] is home to the holiest sites in one of the world's great faiths. [DATE] [CARDINAL] of [NORP] come from around the world to [GPE] to take part in the Hajj. In addition to ancient wonders, this country is also home to modern ones-including soaring achievements in architecture. [GPE] was a thriving center of learning and achievement [DATE] before other parts of the world. The wonders of [GPE], [GPE] and [GPE] are proud monuments to that ancient heritage. All over the world, people dream of walking through the ruins of Petra in [GPE]. [GPE] was the cradle of civilization and is a land of natural beauty. And [GPE] has reached incredible heights with glass and steel, and turned earth and water into spectacular works of art. The entire region is at the center of the key shipping lanes of [FAC], the Red Sea, and the Straits of Hormuz. The potential of this region has never been greater. [PERCENT] of its population is under [DATE]. Like all young men and women, they seek great futures to build, great national projects to join, and a place for their families to call home. But this untapped potential, this tremendous cause for optimism, is held at bay by bloodshed and terror. There can be no coexistence with this violence. There can be no tolerating it, no accepting it, no excusing it, and no ignoring it. Every time a terrorist murders an innocent person, and falsely invokes the name of God, it should be an insult to every person of faith. Terrorists do not worship God, they worship death. If we do not act against this organized terror, then we know what will happen. Terrorism's devastation of life will continue to spread. Peaceful societies will become engulfed by violence. And the futures of many generations will be sadly squandered. If we do not stand in uniform condemnation of this killing-then not only will we be judged by our people, not only will we be judged by history, but we will be judged by God. This is not a battle between different faiths, different sects, or different civilizations. This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it. This is a battle between Good and Evil. When we see the scenes of destruction in the wake of terror, we see no signs that those murdered were [NORP] or [NORP], [NORP] or [NORP]. When we look upon the streams of innocent blood soaked into the ancient ground, we cannot see the faith or sect or tribe of the victims - we see only that they were Children of God whose deaths are an insult to all that is holy. But we can only overcome this evil if the forces of good are united and strong - and if everyone in this room does their fair share and fulfills their part of the burden. Terrorism has spread across the world. But the path to peace begins right here, on this ancient soil, in this sacred land. [GPE] is prepared to stand with you - in pursuit of shared interests and common security. But the nations of the Middle East cannot wait for [NORP] power to crush this enemy for them. The nations of the Middle East will have to decide what kind of future they want for themselves, for their countries, and for their children. It is a choice between [CARDINAL] futures - and it is a choice [GPE] CANNOT make for you. A better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists and extremists. Drive. Them. Out. DRIVE THEM OUT of your places of worship. DRIVE THEM OUT of your communities. DRIVE THEM OUT of your holy land, and DRIVE THEM OUT OF THIS EARTH. For our part, [GPE] is committed to adjusting our strategies to meet evolving threats and new facts. We will discard those strategies that have not worked-and will apply new approaches informed by experience and judgment. We are adopting a Principled Realism, rooted in common values and shared interests. Our friends will never question our support, and our enemies will never doubt our determination. Our partnerships will advance security through stability, not through radical disruption. We will make decisions based on real-world outcomes - not inflexible ideology. We will be guided by the lessons of experience, not the confines of rigid thinking. And, wherever possible, we will seek gradual reforms - not sudden intervention. We must seek partners, not perfection-and to make allies of all who share our goals. Above all, [GPE] seeks peace - not war. [NORP] nations must be willing to take on the burden, if we are going to defeat terrorism and send its wicked ideology into oblivion. The first task in this joint effort is for your nations to deny all territory to the foot soldiers of evil. Every country in the region has an absolute duty to ensure that terrorists find no sanctuary on their soil. Many are already making significant contributions to regional security: [NORP] pilots are crucial partners against [ORG] in [GPE] and [GPE]. [GPE] and a regional coalition have taken strong action against [NORP] militants in [GPE]. The [NORP] Army is hunting [ORG] operatives who try to infiltrate their territory. [NORP] troops are supporting our [NORP] partners. In [GPE], [NORP] troops are supporting [NORP], [NORP] and [NORP] fighting together for their homeland. [GPE], which hosts [ORG], is a crucial strategic partner. Our longstanding partnership with [GPE] and [GPE] continue to enhance security in the region. And courageous [NORP] soldiers are making tremendous sacrifices in the fight against the [ORG], and others, in the fight for their country. As we deny terrorist organizations control of territory and populations, we must also strip them of their access to funds. We must cut off the financial channels that let [ORG] sell oil, let extremists pay their fighters, and help terrorists smuggle their reinforcements. I am proud to announce that the nations here [DATE] will be signing an agreement to prevent the financing of terrorism, called [ORG] - co-chaired by [GPE] and [GPE], and joined by every member of [ORG]. It is another historic step in [DATE] that will be long remembered. I also applaud [ORG] for blocking funders from using their countries as a financial base for terror, and designating [ORG] as a terrorist organization [DATE]. [GPE] also joined us [DATE] in placing sanctions on [CARDINAL] of the most senior leaders of [ORG]. Of course, there is still much work to do. That means honestly confronting the crisis of [NORP] extremism and the [NORP] terror groups it inspires. And it means standing together against the murder of innocent [NORP], the oppression of women, the persecution of [NORP], and the slaughter of [NORP]. Religious leaders must make this absolutely clear: Barbarism will deliver you no glory - piety to evil will bring you no dignity. If you choose the path of terror, your life will be empty, your life will be brief, and YOUR SOUL WILL BE CONDEMNED. And political leaders must speak out to affirm the same idea: heroes do not kill innocents; they save them. Many nations here [DATE] have taken important steps to raise up that message. [GPE] Vision for 2030 is an important and encouraging statement of tolerance, respect, empowering women, and economic development. [GPE] has also engaged in the battle for hearts and souls-and with the [GPE], launched a center to counter the online spread of hate. [GPE] too is working to undermine recruitment and radicalism. I also applaud [GPE], [GPE] and [GPE] for their role in hosting refugees. The surge of migrants and refugees leaving the Middle East depletes the human capital needed to build stable societies and economies. Instead of depriving this region of so much human potential, Middle Eastern countries can give young people hope for a brighter future in their home nations and regions. That means promoting the aspirations and dreams of all citizens who seek a better life - including women, children, and followers of all faiths. Numerous [NORP] and [NORP] scholars have eloquently argued that protecting equality strengthens [NORP] and [NORP] communities. For [DATE] the Middle East has been home to [NORP], [NORP] and [NORP] living side-by-side. We must practice tolerance and respect for each other once again-and make this region a place where every man and woman, no matter their faith or ethnicity, can enjoy a life of dignity and hope. In that spirit, after concluding my visit in [GPE], I will travel to [GPE] and [GPE], and then to the [FAC] - visiting many of the holiest places in the [CARDINAL] Abrahamic Faiths. If these [CARDINAL] faiths can join together in cooperation, then peace in this world is possible - including peace between [NORP] and [NORP]. I will be meeting with both [NORP] Prime Minister [PERSON] and [NORP] President [PERSON]. Starving terrorists of their territory, their funding, and the false allure of their craven ideology, will be the basis for defeating them. But no discussion of stamping out this threat would be complete without mentioning the government that gives terrorists all [CARDINAL]-safe harbor, financial backing, and the social standing needed for recruitment. It is a regime that is responsible for so much instability in the region. I am speaking of course of [GPE]. From [GPE] to [GPE] to [GPE], [GPE] funds, arms, and trains terrorists, militias, and other extremist groups that spread destruction and chaos across the region. For [DATE], [GPE] has fueled the fires of sectarian conflict and terror. It is a government that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing the destruction of [GPE], death to [GPE], and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room. Among [GPE]'s most tragic and destabilizing interventions have been in [GPE]. Bolstered by [GPE], [PERSON] has committed unspeakable crimes, and [GPE] has taken firm action in response to the use of banned chemical weapons by [ORG] - launching [CARDINAL] tomahawk missiles at the [NORP] air base from where that murderous attack originated. Responsible nations must work together to end the humanitarian crisis in [GPE], eradicate [ORG], and restore stability to the region. The [NORP] regime's longest-suffering victims are its own people. [GPE] has a rich history and culture, but the people of [GPE] have endured hardship and despair under their leaders' reckless pursuit of conflict and terror. Until the [NORP] regime is willing to be a partner for peace, all nations of conscience must work together to isolate [GPE], deny it funding for terrorism, and pray for the day when the [NORP] people have the just and righteous government they deserve. The decisions we make will affect countless lives. King [PERSON], I thank you for the creation of this great moment in history, and for your massive investment in [GPE], its industry and its jobs. I also thank you for investing in the future of this part of the world. This fertile region has all the ingredients for extraordinary success - a rich history and culture, a young and vibrant people, a thriving spirit of enterprise. But you can only unlock this future if the citizens of the Middle East are freed from extremism, terror and violence. We in this room are the leaders of our peoples. They look to us for answers, and for action. And when we look back at their faces, behind every pair of eyes is a soul that yearns for justice. [DATE], [CARDINAL] of faces are now looking at us, waiting for us to act on the great question of our time. Will we be indifferent in the presence of evil? Will we protect our citizens from its violent ideology? Will we let its venom spread through our societies? Will we let it destroy the most holy sites on earth? If we do not confront this deadly terror, we know what the future will bring-more suffering and despair. But if we act-if we leave this magnificent room unified and determined to do what it takes to destroy the terror that threatens the world-then there is no limit to the great future our citizens will have. The birthplace of civilization is waiting to begin a new renaissance. Just imagine what [DATE] could bring. Glorious wonders of science, art, medicine and commerce to inspire humankind. Great cities built on the ruins of shattered towns. New jobs and industries that will lift up [CARDINAL] of people. Parents who no longer worry for their children, families who no longer mourn for their loved ones, and the faithful who finally worship without fear. These are the blessings of prosperity and peace. These are the desires that burn with a righteous flame in every human heart. And these are the just demands of our beloved peoples. I ask you to join me, to join together, to work together, and to FIGHT together- BECAUSE UNITED, WE WILL NOT FAIL. Thank you. God Bless You. God Bless Your Countries. And God Bless [GPE].", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsmikepenceworkersfortrumpeventspeechtranscriptseptember1", "text": "To Congressman [PERSON], to [PERSON] and all the hardworking men and women of [ORG]. The neighbors and friends from across [GPE], it is great to be back in [GPE] with workers for [PERSON]. I am so grateful y'all came out on [DATE], [DATE] as we start the road to victory on [DATE]. It really is great to be here with so many friends who've supported this president and our administration from [DATE]. Would you join me in thanking someone who has been a fighter for this administration? He has stood strong for an agenda that made [GPE] great again in [DATE] and seen this state and nation through trying time, Congressman [PERSON], thank you for your great leadership in [ORG] and for [GPE]. It is also great to be here with [CARDINAL] future members of [ORG] who I know are going to stand with this president and our agenda for [DATE]. Join me in thanking [PERSON] and [PERSON]. [GPE] needs to send them to [GPE], D.C. It really is great to be with all of you. You can take a seat if you got one, because I am here for [CARDINAL] reason and [CARDINAL] reason only, and that is that [GPE] and [GPE] need [DATE] of President [PERSON] in [FAC]. It is on, [GPE]. It is on and I am so excited to be back with all of you. We had [DATE] [DATE]. How about that Republican National Convention? Did you check some of that out? I mean come [DATE] [TIME], President [PERSON] laid out an inspiring vision, an inspiring vision for our second term, a vision of more jobs, better wages, more support for our heroes and [TIME] the president said that voters have never faced a clearer choice. This election, as he said, will decide whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny or whether we save the [NORP] dream. Standing here in [GPE], I know we are going to vote for [GPE], we are going to vote for [DATE] for President [PERSON] in [FAC]. You know I know we are not too far from our opponent's boyhood home, but it is [PERSON] country now. I am here because I stand with President [PERSON]. When this president stands up for faith and family and the [NORP] flag, I stand with President [PERSON]. When this president stands up to the radical left and their socialist agenda, I stand with President [PERSON] and when this president stands up for [NORP] workers and jobs, jobs, jobs, we stand with President [PERSON]. [DATE] a movement was born and judging from this crowd and everybody I saw on the way here, it looks like that movement's doing just fine in [GPE]. It was a movement of everyday [NORP] from every walk of life. Here in [GPE], you believed we could be strong again. You believed we could be prosperous again. You said yes to President [PERSON] in [DATE] and I know that [GPE]'s going to say yes to [DATE] of President [PERSON] in [DATE]. I mean look how far we have come. [DATE] we inherited a military hollowed out by devastating budget cuts, an economy struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. Terrorism was on the rise around the world and we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values, the freedom of religion and the right to life, and in [DATE], we rebuilt our military. We restored the arsenal of democracy and we are once again giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, [NORP] and space force the resources and support they need to defend this nation. We revived our economy. We cut taxes across the board, rolled back federal red tape, unleashed [NORP] energy, fought for free and fair trade. We stood for all of our God-given liberties, like the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, and the unalienable right to life. This president stood for the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and we always will. We appointed conservatives, [CARDINAL] conservatives at every level including [CARDINAL] great [ORG] justices and [DATE], this president and this administration have stood with the men and women of law enforcement all across [GPE]. [DATE], the president is visiting [GPE] to show support for the people of [GPE] who've been through a lot in [DATE]. He went there to show support for law enforcement for [ORG], and President [PERSON] is in [GPE] [DATE] to make it clear that we stand for law and order in every city and every town for every [NORP]. I saw [PERSON] was in [GPE] [DATE]. Did you see it? After [DATE] of staying silent on riots and looting and violence in the streets of our cities, [PERSON] finally came out of his basement and he actually said we have to stand against violence in every form it takes. Right after that, he criticized law enforcement and he never mentioned any of the anarchists or left wing mobs that have been sewing violence in the streets of our major cities. [PERSON] said [DATE] he does not think he looks like a radical socialist with a soft spot for rioters. But men and women of [GPE], you should know, [DATE] [PERSON] never condemned ANTIFA. He never called on [NORP] mayors to get their cities under control. He never called out his campaign staff or his running mate for raising money to bail out violent criminals. [PERSON] never even offered a plan to end the violence. For [DATE] all he is talked about is peaceful protesters as the [NORP] people have watched businesses and communities in our major cities burn. It is been heartbreaking to watch. The truth is [PERSON] would double down on the policies that have led to violence in [GPE]'s cities. I think you all know you will not be safe in [PERSON] [GPE]. Now President [PERSON] and I will always support the right of [NORP] to peaceful protest but rioting and looting is not peaceful protest. Burning businesses is not free speech and those who do so will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Too many heroes have died defending our freedom to see a - Too many heroes have died defending our freedom to see [NORP] strike each other down in our streets. We will have law and order on the streets of this country for every [NORP] of every race and creed and color so help us God. And I think the people of [GPE] know despite what the many leaders in [ORG] have to say, many voices in the media and those on the radical level, we do not have to choose between supporting law enforcement and standing with our [NORP] neighbors to improve the quality of their lives, their education, their jobs, and safety. From [DATE] of this administration we have done both and we will keep supporting law enforcement and keep supporting our [NORP] and minority communities across this land for [DATE]. [PERSON] says [GPE] is systemically racist and that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities. And when asked whether he'd support cutting funding to law enforcement [PERSON] replied, Yes, absolutely. But under President [PERSON] I will make you a promise, we will always stand with those who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement. We are not going to defund the police not now, not ever. So, under President [PERSON]'s leadership we have stood for a stronger and safer [GPE]. We stood up for all of our liberties, we have revived our economy. And in [DATE] businesses large and small created [CARDINAL] good paying jobs including [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] manufacturing jobs. [GPE] and [GPE]. I have a lot in common. I always used to say back when I was governor of the hoosier state that we did [CARDINAL] things well, we make things and we grow things but the last administration lost [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] manufacturing jobs. The last president with his vice president [PERSON] actually said in [DATE] he was asked about manufacturing jobs he says, I do not know what you are going to do to bring them back. He said, What magic wand do you have? Well, the people of [GPE] knew we did not need a magic wand we just needed President [PERSON] in the white house, [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] manufacturing jobs created in [DATE]. In [DATE] with your support we created the greatest economy in the world. We made [GPE] great again. And then the Corona virus struck from [GPE] but before the first case of Corona virus spread person to person within [GPE] our president took the unprecedented action of suspending all travel from [GPE]. And I promise you that action saved untold [NORP] lives and it bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II. At the president's direction we marshaled the full resources of the federal government and the [NORP] economy. We partnered with private industry to reinvent testing. We produced [CARDINAL] of supplies distributed to our great doctors and nurses and hospital workers around the country. And as we speak we are developing a growing number of treatments that are saving lives across [GPE]. And even though [PERSON] said that, No miracle is coming, I have got news for you. We are on track to have the world's first safe and effective Corona virus vaccine by [DATE]. [GPE] is the land of miracles. Now that said, I want to be clear. Our hearts go out to all the families that have lost loved ones during the course of this pandemic including the [CARDINAL] 000 families here in the keystone state. Know that you have always been in our hearts and you will remain in our prayers. But thanks to the courage and compassion of the [NORP] people, the extraordinary work of our healthcare workers, we are slowing the spread, we are protecting the vulnerable, we are saving lives and we are opening up [GPE] again. In [DATE] I promise you we are going to continue to put the health of [GPE] first. As we work to bring this economy all the way back we all have a role to play but we all have a choice to make. Because of the strong foundation that President [PERSON] and the congressmen and our allies in [GPE] helped us to pour it is amazing to think we have already seen [CARDINAL] [NORP] go back to work in [DATE] including [CARDINAL], 000 jobs right here in [GPE]. And [TIME] we saw the manufacturing, the backbone of the [NORP] economy actually expanded at the highest rate since [DATE]. Men and women of [GPE], because of the strong foundation on which we are standing the great [NORP] comeback is happening. But you need to ask yourself and ask your neighbors to come [DATE]. As our economy is beginning to stand back up, as we are putting [CARDINAL] of [NORP] back to work, you need to ask yourself who do you trust to rebuild this economy. A career politician who presided over the slowest recovery since the great depression or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world. The choice is clear to bring [GPE] all the way back we need [DATE] of President [PERSON] in the white house. So, we have been going through a time of testing. As I said [TIME] we are soon coming to a time for choosing and on safety and security jobs and values the choice could not be more clear. I mean think about it, in the middle of a global pandemic [PERSON] wants to raise taxes by [MONEY]. President [PERSON], well we cut taxes across the board for working families, businesses large and small and we are going to cut taxes again in [DATE]. [PERSON] wants to bury our economy under an avalanche of red tape like his own version of the green new deal. President [PERSON] he actually signed more laws cutting federal red tape than any president in [NORP] history and we are going to keep chopping for [DATE]. [PERSON], he wants to go back to economic surrender with [GPE]. He actually said he would repeal all the tariffs that the president put into place that have been leveling the playing field for [NORP] workers. President [PERSON], he stood up to [GPE]. He put [NORP] jobs and [NORP] workers first and we are going to stand strong until we level the playing field once and for all. Also on trade [PERSON] voted for NAFTA, we all know what that did to this economy. But thanks to President [PERSON] [ORG] is [DATE] and the [ORG] is here to stay. It is a win for [NORP] jobs. The experts tell us the [ORG] could create [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] new jobs including [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] manufacturing jobs, it is incredible. And where President [PERSON] ended the war on coal, unleashed [NORP] energy and we are now a net exporter of energy for the first time in [DATE]. [PERSON] and the radical left want to crush [NORP] energy, crush [NORP] energy jobs, and raise the cost of electricity for every household and business in [GPE]. But [DATE] [PERSON] actually went to [GPE] and after [DATE] of campaigning on a plan to abolish fossil fuels he said, I am not He said, I am not banning fracking. In fact, he said it twice. And then he said President [PERSON] was lying about his record. So let me set the record straight. When [PERSON] was asked [DATE] and I quote, Would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking in a [PERSON] administration? [PERSON] said, quote, No, we would walk it out. Here in [GPE] where ending fracking would literally cost [CARDINAL] jobs by some estimates, you deserve to know, that when [PERSON] was asked whether he'd be willing to quote, Sacrifice [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] of blue collar jobs for the sake of a radical environmental agenda, [PERSON] said, quote, The answer's yes. And this time [DATE] he told a supporter and I quote, I guarantee, I guarantee we are going to end fossil fuels. [PERSON], that includes fracking. I mean, what [PERSON] does not know is [GPE]'s future depends on energy independence. So let me tell all the great workers gathered here at [ORG], whatever you may hear over [DATE] that remains [DATE], [PERSON] and the radical left are going to try to ban fracking and abolish fossil fuels, but we are not going to let it happen. I guarantee, I guarantee with [DATE] of President [PERSON] in [FAC], we will have more fracking, more [NORP] energy, and energy independence for generations to come. So it is been about prosperity and security, but it is also about recognizing that we have a president that knows that if you do not have a border, you do not have a nation. And [PERSON] is for open borders, sanctuary cities, free lawyers and healthcare for illegal immigrants. President [PERSON] has stood by the men and women of customs and border protection. We have made historic investments in border security, and we have already built [QUANTITY] of that border wall on the Southern border of [GPE]. And with [DATE], we are going to build it all. And finally, beyond security and safety and prosperity, it is also about values in this election. For [DATE], [PERSON] took the position that while he supported abortion rights, he did not support using taxpayer funds to pay for abortion. But now [PERSON] supports using taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion all the way up to the moment of birth. I could not be more proud to be vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. President [PERSON] is the most pro-life president in [NORP] history. And it is not just been about life, it is been about liberty, and this president has stood strong for the freedom of religion of every [NORP] of every faith, and we always will. President [PERSON] in [DATE], ended the assault on [ORG] and the supreme court of [GPE] made it permanent. [PERSON], he actually said that he would work to reimpose the [ORG] mandates on those wonderful nuns, but we are not going to let it happen. You know, the choice in this election has never been clear. The stakes have never been higher. When you look at that agenda, it is clear, [PERSON] would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for an agenda of the radical left. [DATE], [PERSON] said that democracy was on the ballot, but I think you all know that our economy is on the ballot, law and order are on the ballot, but there are also things much more fundamental and foundational to our country that are on the ballot as well. I think in this election, it is not so much whether [GPE] will be more conservative or more liberal, whether it will be more republican or more [NORP], more red or blue. I think the choice in this election is whether [GPE] remains [GPE]. Whether we are going to chart a course grounded in our highest ideals of freedom and free markets, the unalienable right to life and liberty, or whether we are going to change course as a nation and fundamentally transform our country and our economy into something entirely different. President [PERSON] has set our nation on a path of freedom and opportunity, and [PERSON] would set [GPE] on a path of socialism and decline. Men and women, I came to [GPE] [DATE] because we stand at a crossroads. [PERSON] and [ORG] have been overtaken by the radical left. Many of you may have described and identified yourself as [NORP] in the past. You may still [DATE], but y'all deserve to know this is not your father's or your mother's [ORG]. The truth is [ORG] [DATE] is about higher taxes, socialized medicine, open borders, abortion on demand and cutting funding to law enforcement. It would take our nation on a path of socialism and decline. And so I say to all my fellow [NORP], all our independents, and every great [NORP] gathered here, we need to decide right here and right now that [PERSON] is never going to be president of [GPE]. We are going to reelect president [PERSON] for [DATE]. Because for all we have done in [DATE], for all we have done through [DATE] of [DATE], that is just what President [PERSON] calls a good start. We are going to keep [GPE] going, keep [GPE] growing. And with [DATE], I promise you, [DATE] means more jobs. For more [DATE] means more judges. [DATE] means more support for our troops, and it is going to take [DATE] to drain that swamp. So ladies and gentlemen, it is on, and it is time. And President [PERSON], I think you all figured out a while ago, President [PERSON] is a real deal. He is a man who says what he means, and means what he says. Never quits. He never backs down. Now I can tell you firsthand, he is never stopped fighting to keep the promises that he made to the people of [GPE], now it is our turn to fight for him. So I need you to bring it. Bring all your enthusiasts. Talk to your neighbors and friends in [DATE] [DATE]. And when you get out there, have faith. Have faith that even in these divided times that every time the [NORP] people have been presented a choice between a future of more freedom or a future of less freedom, the [NORP] people choose freedom every time. So have faith in your neighbors and friends, speak to them. At work, at worship. Tell them I was over at the construction company, I ran into [PERSON]. He talked for [TIME], just like giving a summary. He said, he talked for [TIME], just like giving a summary of everything we got done under this president, everything we have been able to do for the [NORP] people. So go talk to your neighbors and friends and be confident. I'd also encourage you to have that other kind of faith. It seems as you turn on the television [DATE], it seems like there is more that divides this country than any time in my lifetime but I will always believe, and I believe it more having traveled across this country as your vice president, that there is always be more that unites the [NORP] people than could ever divide us and chief among those things is faith. This is a nation effect. So I want to say to you, if you are inclined to bow the head and bend the knee from time to time, I encourage you to do that too. And on this one, I am not asking for support for a candidate or a cause or a party. I am just thinking about our country and I am thinking about that ancient promise that if his people, who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray, he will do like he is always done through the long and storied history of this country. He will hear from heaven and he will heal this land. This [CARDINAL] nation, under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. So pray for [GPE]. Pray for all the [NORP] people. It will make a difference. So I thank you for coming out [DATE]. I leave here [DATE] with renewed confidence that with your continued support and energy and your prayers, [DATE], that we are going to lead a great [NORP] comeback. We are going to have a great victory for the [NORP] people and for [GPE], herself. We are going to make [GPE] and [GPE] stronger and more prosperous than ever before and I just know, when we re-elect Congressman [PERSON] to [ORG], when we send [PERSON] and [PERSON] to a new [NORP] majority in [ORG], we re-elect principled [NORP] leaders at every level, all across this country and when we re-elect President [PERSON] for [DATE], we will make [GPE] great again. Again. Thank you all very much. God bless [GPE] and God Bless [GPE].", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptspresidentdonaldtrumpfarewelladdressspeechtranscript", "text": "My fellow [NORP], [DATE] we launched a great national effort to rebuild our country, to renew its spirit, and to restore the allegiance of this government to its citizens. In short, we embarked on a mission to make [GPE] great again for all [NORP]. As I conclude my term as the 45th President of [GPE], I stand before you truly proud of what we have achieved together. We did what we came here to do, and so much more. [DATE] we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping [GPE] safe and prosperous. We extend our best wishes, and we also want them to have luck, a very important word. I'd like to begin by thanking just a few of the amazing people who made our remarkable journey possible. First, let me express my overwhelming gratitude for the love and support of our spectacular First Lady [PERSON]. Let me also share my deepest appreciation to my daughter, [PERSON], my son-in-law [PERSON], and to [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], and [PERSON]. You fill my world with light and with joy. I also want to thank Vice President [PERSON], his wonderful wife, [PERSON], and the entire [PERSON] family. Thank you as well to my chief of staff, [PERSON], the dedicated members of the [ORG] staff, and the cabinet, and all of the incredible people across our administration who poured out their heart and soul to fight for [GPE]. I also want to take [TIME] to thank a truly exceptional group of people, [ORG]. My family and I will forever be in your debt. My profound gratitude as well to everyone in the [ORG] military office, the teams of Marine One and Air Force One, every member of the armed forces, and state and local law enforcement all across our country. Most of all, I want to thank the [NORP] people. To serve as your president has been an honor beyond description. Thank you for this extraordinary privilege. And that is what it is, a great privilege and a great honor. We must never forget that while [NORP] will always have our disagreements, we are a nation of incredible, decent, faithful, and peace-loving citizens who all want our country to thrive and flourish and be very, very successful and good. We are a truly magnificent nation. All [NORP] were horrified by the assault on our capital. Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as [NORP]. It can never be tolerated. Now more than ever, we must unify around our shared values and rise above the partisan rancor and forge our common destiny. [DATE], I came to [GPE] as the only true outsider ever to win the presidency. I had not spent my career as a politician, but as a builder looking at open skylines and imagining infinite possibilities. I ran for president because I knew there were towering new summits for [GPE] just waiting to be scaled. I knew the potential for our nation was boundless as long as we put [GPE] first. So I left behind my former life and stepped into a very difficult arena, but an arena, nevertheless, with all sorts of potential if properly done. [GPE] had given me so much and I wanted to give something back. Together with [CARDINAL] of hardworking [NORP] across this land, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country. We also built the greatest economy in the history of the world. It was about [GPE] first because we all wanted to make [GPE] great again. We restored the principle that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Our agenda was not about right or left. It was not about [NORP] or [NORP], but about the good of a nation, and that means the whole nation. With the support and prayers of the [NORP] people, we achieved more than anyone thought possible. Nobody thought we could even come close. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in [NORP] history. We slashed more job-killing regulations than any administration had ever done before. We fix our broken trade deals, withdrew from the horrible [ORG] and the impossible Paris Climate Accord, renegotiated the [CARDINAL]-sided [GPE] deal. And we replaced NAFTA with the groundbreaking USMCA, that is [GPE] and [GPE], a deal that is worked out very, very well. Also and very importantly, we imposed historic and monumental tariffs on [GPE], made a great new deal with [GPE]. But before the ink was even dry, we and the whole world got hit with the [GPE] virus. Our trade relationship was rapidly changing. Billions and billions of dollars were pouring into the [GPE] but the virus forced us to go in a different direction. The whole world suffered, but [GPE] outperformed other countries economically because of our incredible economy and the economy that we built. Without the foundations and footings, it would not have worked out this way. We would not have some of the best numbers we have ever had. We also unlocked our energy resources and became the world's number [CARDINAL] producer of oil and natural gas by far. Powered by these policies, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We reignited [GPE]'s job creation and achieved record-low unemployment for [NORP], [NORP], [NORP], women, almost everyone. Income soared, wages boomed. The [NORP] dream was restored and [CARDINAL] were lifted from poverty in [DATE]. It was a miracle. The stock market set [CARDINAL] record after another, with [CARDINAL] stock market highs during the short period of time, and boosted the retirements and pensions of hardworking citizens all across our nation. 401s are at a level they have never been at before. We have never seen numbers like we have seen, and that is before the pandemic and after the pandemic. We rebuilt the [NORP] manufacturing base, opened up [CARDINAL] of new factories, and brought back the beautiful phrase Made in the [GPE]. To make life better for working families, we doubled the child tax credit and signed the largest-ever expansion of funding for childcare and development. We joined with the private sector to secure commitments to train [CARDINAL] [NORP] workers for the jobs of [DATE]. When our nation was hit with the terrible pandemic, we produced not [CARDINAL], but [CARDINAL] vaccines with record-breaking speed and more will quickly follow. They said it could not be done, but we did it. They called it a medical miracle. And that is what they are calling it right now, a medical miracle. Another administration would have taken [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], maybe even [DATE] to develop a vaccine. We did it in [DATE]. We grieve for every life lost and we pledge in their memory to wipe out this horrible pandemic once and for all. When the virus took its brutal toll on the world's economy, we launched the fastest economic recovery our country has ever seen. We passed [MONEY] in economic relief, saved or supported [CARDINAL] jobs, and slashed the unemployment rate in [CARDINAL]. These are numbers that our country has never seen before. We created choice and transparency in healthcare, stood up to big pharma in so many ways, but especially in our effort to get favored nations clauses added, which will give us the lowest prescription drug prices anywhere in the world. We passed [ORG], [ORG] Accountability, Right to Try, and landmark criminal justice reform. We confirmed [CARDINAL] new justices of [ORG]. We appointed [CARDINAL] federal judges to interpret our Constitution as written. For [DATE], the [NORP] people pleaded with [GPE] to finally secure the nation's borders. I am pleased to say, we answered that plea and achieved the most secure border in [GPE] history. We have given our brave border agents and heroic [ORG] officers the tools they need to do their jobs better than they have ever done before and to enforce our laws and keep [GPE] safe. We proudly leave the next administration with the strongest and most robust border security measures ever put into place. This includes historic agreements with [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE], along with [QUANTITY] of powerful new wall. We restored [NORP] strength at home and [NORP] leadership abroad. The world respects us again. Please do not lose that respect. We reclaimed our sovereignty by standing up for [GPE] at [ORG] and withdrawing from the [CARDINAL]-sided global deals that never served our interests. And [ORG] countries are now paying [MONEY] more than when I arrived [DATE]. It was very unfair. We were paying the cost for the world. Now the world is helping us. And perhaps most importantly of all, with [MONEY], we fully rebuilt the [NORP] military, all made in the [GPE]. We launched the first new branch of [ORG] in [DATE], [ORG]. And [DATE], I stood at [FAC] in [GPE] and watched as [NORP] astronauts returned to space on [NORP] rockets for the first time in [DATE]. We revitalize our alliances and rallied the nations of the world to stand up to [GPE] like never before. We obliterated the [ORG] caliphate and ended the wretched life of its founder and leader [PERSON]. We stood up to the oppressive [NORP] regime and killed the world's top terrorist, [NORP] butcher, [PERSON]. We recognize [GPE] as the capital of [GPE] and recognized [NORP] sovereignty over the Golan Heights. As a result of our bold diplomacy and principled realism, we achieved a series of historic peace deals in the Middle East. Nobody believed it could happen. The Abraham Accords opened the doors to a future of peace and harmony, not violence and bloodshed. It is the dawn of a new Middle East, and we are bringing our soldiers home. I am especially proud to be the first president in [DATE] who has started no new wars. Above all, we have reasserted the sacred idea that in [GPE] the government answers to the people. Our guiding light, our North star, our unwavering conviction has been that we are here to serve the noble everyday citizens of [GPE]. Our allegiance is not to the special interests corporations or global entities, it is to our children, our citizens, and to our nation itself. As president my top priority, my constant concern has always been the best interests of [NORP] workers and [NORP] families. I did not seek the easiest course. By far, it was actually the most difficult. I did not seek the path that would get the least criticism. I took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices because that is what you elected me to do. Your needs were my first and last unyielding focus. This, I hope, will be our greatest legacy. Together, we put the [NORP] people back in charge of our country. We restored self-government. We restored the idea that in [GPE] no one is forgotten because everyone matters and everyone has a voice. We fought for the principle that every citizen is entitled to equal dignity, equal treatment, and equal rights because we are all made equal by God. Everyone is entitled to be treated with respect, to have their voice heard, and to have the government listen. You are loyal to your country and my administration was always loyal to you. We worked to build a country in which every citizen could find a great job and support their wonderful families. We fought for the communities where every [NORP] could be safe and schools where every child could learn. We promoted a culture where our laws would be upheld, our heroes honored, our history preserved, and law-abiding citizens are never taken for granted. [NORP] should take tremendous satisfaction in all that we have achieved together. It is incredible. Now, as I leave the white house, I have been reflecting on the dangers that threaten the priceless inheritance we all share. As the world's most powerful nation, [GPE] faces constant threats and challenges from abroad. But the greatest danger we face is a loss of confidence in ourselves, a loss of confidence in our national greatness. A nation is only as strong as its spirit. We are only as dynamic as our pride. We are only as vibrant as the faith that beats in the hearts of our people. No nation can long thrive that loses faith in its own values, history, and heroes for these are the very sources of our unity and our vitality. What has always allowed [GPE] to prevail and triumph over the great challenges of the past has been an unyielding and unashamed conviction in the nobility of our country and its unique purpose in history. We must never lose this conviction. We must never forsake our belief in [GPE]. The key to national greatness lies in sustaining and instilling our shared national identity. That means focusing on what we have in common, the heritage that we all share. At the center of this heritage is also a robust belief in free expression, free speech, and open debate. Only if we forget who we are and how we got here could we ever allow political censorship and blacklisting to take place in [GPE]. It is not even thinkable. Shutting down free and open debate violates our core values and most enduring traditions. In [GPE], we do not insist on absolute conformity or enforce rigid orthodoxies and punitive speech codes. We just do not do that. [GPE] is not a timid nation of tame souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree. That is not who we are. It will never be who we are. For [DATE] in the face of every challenge, [NORP] have always summoned our unmatched courage, confidence, and fierce independence. These are the miraculous traits that once led [CARDINAL] of everyday citizens to set out across a wild continent and carve out a new life in the great West. It was the same profound love of our God-given freedom that willed our soldiers into battle and our astronauts into space. As I think back on [DATE], one image rises in my mind above all others. Whenever I traveled all along the motorcade route, there were [CARDINAL] of people. They came out with their families so that they could stand as we passed and proudly wave our great [NORP] flag. It never failed to deeply move me. I knew that they did not just come out to show their support of me. They came out to show me their support and love for our country. This is a republic of proud citizens who are united by our common conviction, that [GPE] is the greatest nation in all of history. We are and must always be a land of hope, of light, and of glory to all the world. This is the precious inheritance that we must safeguard at every single turn. For [DATE], I have worked to do just that. From a great hall of [NORP] leaders in [GPE] to a great square of [NORP] people in [GPE], from the floor of [ORG] to the podium at [ORG], and from the forbidden city in [GPE] to the shadow of Mount Rushmore, I fought for you. I fought for your family. I fought for our country. Above all, I fought for [GPE] and all it stands for, and that is safe, strong, proud, and free. Now, as I prepare to hand power over to a new administration at [TIME] on [DATE], I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning. There is never been anything like it. The belief that a nation must serve its citizens will not dwindle, but instead, only grows stronger by [DATE]. As long as the [NORP] people hold in their hearts, deep and devoted love of country, then there is nothing that this nation can not achieve. Our communities will flourish. Our people will be prosperous. Our traditions will be cherished. Our faith will be strong and our future will be brighter than ever before. I go from this majestic place with a loyal and joyful heart, an optimistic spirit, and a supreme confidence that for our country and for our children, the best is yet to come. Thank you and farewell. God bless you. God bless [GPE].", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsmikepencespeechtranscriptontrumpmayneverseeeyetoeyeonjanuary6", "text": "Well, hello, [GPE]. It is great to be back in [GPE], [CARDINAL] of the strongest [NORP] counties in New England, and let us hear it for Chairman [PERSON] and [ORG], everybody. What a great night. And I want to extend congratulations to [ORG] and especially the town committees that are being honored [TIME]. Because of all of you, [NORP] now hold majorities in both [ORG] of the state legislature. What a great, great victory, But it really is great to be back at this dinner. I was reminded that I was graciously invited to speak to [ORG] [DATE], and I get an invitation I guess [DATE] to come back. But it was amazing when I think of [DATE] [DATE]. It was [DATE] that we won back to [ORG] from [PERSON] [NORP] majority. [DATE], we won the [ORG], and then we won back [GPE]. And I am here to say, I believe we are on the verge of another great [NORP] comeback and it starts right here in the live free or die state of [GPE]. I believe it. And I want to thank a couple of people, and most notably, the man you just heard from. I mean, talk about a good guy, someone who has a heart for public service. I knew a couple others [inaudible 00:02:17] in the course of my life and my career and I count them as friends as well, but I have to tell you, the people of [GPE] are blessed by the extraordinary and compassionate leadership of Governor [PERSON] and I am grateful for his esteem and support. I appreciate that overly generous introduction that he made, but [PERSON] knows me well enough to know that the introduction I prefer is a little bit shorter. I am a [NORP], a conservative and a [NORP], in that order, and it is my honor to be back in the state of [GPE]. I also want to thank Executive Councilor [PERSON] on a lifetime of service and his recognition [TIME], and also Speaker [PERSON] is here. I know they are in session, and Mr. Speaker, we appreciate all the great leadership that you have provided, a [NORP] majority are providing here in [GPE]. God bless you. Well, I came here [TIME] really for [CARDINAL] reasons. First and foremost, I wanted to pay a debt of gratitude. To the people of [GPE], I just want to say thank you on behalf of myself and my family. Thank you for the great privilege of serving as Vice President of [GPE]. It was the greatest honor of my life And secondly, after [DATE] where the [PERSON] administration and [NORP] in [GPE] have been pushing open borders, higher taxes, runaway spending, more government, defunding the police, abandoning the right to life, censoring free speech, canceling our most cherished liberties, I came here to say enough is enough. I came here to say the time is now for every patriotic [NORP] who shares our ideals and values to stand up and fight back against the agenda of the radical left. I learned a lot serving alongside President [PERSON]. Some people think we are a little bit different, but I think what President [PERSON] showed us was what [NORP] can accomplish when our leaders stand firm on conservative principles and do not back down. That is exactly what he did for [DATE]. And under President [PERSON] and our administration, it was [DATE] of consequence, [DATE] of results. It was [DATE] of promises made and promises kept. I mean, think about it, think about it. In [DATE], the [PERSON]-Pence administration achieved the lowest unemployment, the highest household incomes, the most energy production, the most [NORP] trade deals, the most secure border and the strongest military in the history of the world. That is incredible. I am writing a book about our time in [FAC] and almost everybody's excited about it. But I cannot wait. I cannot wait to unpack all that we did under this President's leadership and with the strong support of the people here in [ORG] on [GPE]. I mean, in [DATE], think about it, we rebuilt the military and defeated the [ORG] caliphate. We revived the economy and created [CARDINAL] good paying jobs. We cut taxes. We cut regulations at a record pace, became a net exporter of energy for the first time in [DATE]. We held [GPE] accountable for [DATE] of trade abuses and brought jobs back to the [GPE]. And in the face of the worst pandemic in [DATE], we launched the greatest national mobilization since World War II. And [DATE] we left office, we were vaccinating [CARDINAL] [NORP] a day, But I have to tell you, to provide for the common defense is the first object of the national government, and I am proud to say our record was unparalleled for any administration in history. And I am proud and grateful for that record, not just because I was your Vice President, but I am the proud father of a [GPE] Marine Captain who is currently deployed in service of [GPE]. And I am also proud to say one of my unworthy son-in-laws is a Lieutenant and a pilot in [ORG]. But under our administration, we rebuilt the military, a record [MONEY] in our national defense. And with that renewed [NORP] strength, we stood with our allies and stood up to our enemies as never before. Our forces defeated the [ORG] caliphate and took down their leader without [CARDINAL] [NORP] casualty. We isolated [GPE] as never before, withdrew from the [GPE] nuclear deal, and [DATE], we saw [NORP] nation sign historic peace agreements with [GPE] for the first time in [DATE]. And it was this President and this administration that kept our word to the [NORP] people and our most cherished ally when we moved the [NORP] embassy to [GPE], the capital of the state of [GPE]. And [DATE] for [DATE], we stood up the timeless values that have always made this country great. [CARDINAL] conservatives confirmed to our federal courts at every level, including Justice [PERSON], Justice [PERSON], and Justice [PERSON]. And [DATE], we defended all the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution and our Bill of Rights for every [NORP] of every belief. And we stood without apology [DATE] for the sanctity of human life. With your support here in [GPE], the support of people all across this country, and your prayers, we made history, we made a difference, we made [GPE] greater than ever before. But how times have changed. I know the Governor said he did not come here to bash the current administration- here to bash the current administration. Well, I did. So buckle up. [DATE], and the [PERSON]-[PERSON] administration has launched an avalanche of big government liberal policies, the likes of which I have never even imagined I'd see in [DATE]. And all of it designed to derail the progress that we made over [DATE]. When President [PERSON] takes to the podium in the [ORG] of [GPE], and he announced an explosion of runaway spending, [MONEY]. And after our administration worked in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic in a bipartisan way, every bill that passed the [ORG] passed on a bipartisan basis, they forced through the [ORG] a COVID bill to fund to massive expansion of the welfare state. And they passed it on a partisan vote. It is amazing the difference in approach. You heard Governor [PERSON] talk about the difference in engagement and I will leave that opinion to him. But I will tell you things are a little bit different. Our [ORG] worked closely with research companies and our administration to launch Operation Warp Speed. We cleared out the underbrush, we provided [CARDINAL] in support and we developed [CARDINAL] safe and effective vaccines in [DATE] that are saving lives all across [GPE] and all over the world. Their [ORG], I saw on the plane when I was flying here [DATE], actually just issued a warning to [NORP] and I quote, Do not eat cicadas. I did not make that up. I mean, the truth is, they have been so busy on their side. Sometimes I think the left hand does not know what the far left hand is doing. I mean, seriously. Seriously. They have literally, they have proposed [MONEY] in the so-called infrastructure bill that is just a thinly disclosed climate change bill and the Green New Deal. And just as our economy here in [GPE] and across [GPE] is getting back on our feet and [NORP] are going back to work, they plan to pay for all of this massive spending with military budget cuts and the largest tax increase in [DATE]. Well, I just say enough is enough. And we are going to stand strong and send a message from right here in the live free or die state that we are going to stand strong for freedom, and we are going to stand strong for a growing and prosperous [GPE] with a limited federal government. But you know, it does not stop there. After inheriting the most secure border in [NORP] history, the [PERSON] administration ended construction on the border wall and canceled policies that had reduced illegal immigration by [PERCENT]. And I do not have to tell you they have unleashed the worst border crisis in history. They have bent the knee to international bureaucrats planning to join the Paris Climate Accord and the Iran Nuclear Deal. They formed a commission to pack [ORG], supported more calls for gun control, eroding our second amendment rights. And they have joined the woke chorus accusing law enforcement in [GPE] of systemic racism. And President [PERSON]'s failed leadership, his home and only been matched by weak leadership abroad. It has set off the worst outbreak of violence in the Middle East in [DATE]. After our administration stood strong with [GPE] [DATE] for [DATE], President [PERSON] restored [MONEY] to the [NORP] authority. Announced plans to begin negotiations again with [GPE]. And he even remained silent as [ORG] terrorists were firing [CARDINAL] of rockets at [NORP] citizens. Incredible. President [PERSON] replaced strength with weakness, moral clarity with confusion, and loyalty with betrayal. But you in [GPE] know what I know. When it comes to the foreign policy of [GPE], if the world knows nothing else, let the world know this, [GPE] stands with [GPE]. And maybe the most troubling developments to families in [DATE] has been the [PERSON] administration's wholehearted embrace on the radical left's all encompassing assault on [NORP] culture and values. Under the [PERSON] administration, patriotic education has been replaced with political indoctrination. They abolished [ORG] and authorized teaching critical race theory in our schools. Instead of teaching all of our children, regardless of race or creed or color to be proud of their country, critical race theory teaches children as young as kindergarten to be ashamed of their skin color. Well, let me say, as my friend [PERSON] said, with great effect on the national stage, not long ago, [GPE] is not a racist country. It is past time for [GPE] to discard the left wing myth of systemic racism. And I commend state legislatures all across the country and governors who are banning critical race theory from our schools. Our founders said that we were to strive for a more perfect union. And so we have done throughout the long and storied history of this country. And while we are not perfect yet, we ought to do justice to all the progress that has been made and recognize that [GPE] is the most just, noble and inclusive nation that has ever existed on the face of the Earth. And the [GPE] military is the greatest force for good the world has ever known. As our soldiers protect us abroad, we also do well to always pay a debt of honor and a debt of gratitude to those who put on a different uniform [DATE], put on a sidearm. And like my uncle who walked a beat in [GPE] for [DATE], count our lives [DATE] as more important than their own. Law enforcement officers in [GPE] are heroes, and they should be honored by every [NORP] [DATE]. [DATE] at [FAC] I told the [NORP] people that they would not be safe in [PERSON] [GPE]. And it grieves my heart to report to you [TIME] in [GPE] that murders have now increased by [CARDINAL] in our largest cities. [NORP] efforts to defund the police, withdraw support for law enforcement has set off a violent crime wave that is wreaking havoc in families all across the nation. Black lives are not endangered by police, [NORP] lives are saved by police [DATE]. We do not need to defund the police. We need to defend the police and reject the anti law enforcement agenda of [PERSON] and- The anti-law enforcement agenda of [PERSON] and the [NORP] in [GPE] and put the lives of law-abiding citizens, every race, and creed, and color first. It is just amazing when you think of that, we are [DATE]. In [DATE], you remember [PERSON] was campaigning as a moderate when he campaigned, but he is literally governed as the most liberal president since [PERSON]. Even [ORG] said that President [PERSON] had exceeded [ORG]'s expectations, And that is saying a lot. But I do not believe for [CARDINAL] moment that that is what the [NORP] people voted for in [DATE]. They did not vote to open our borders, to give away safety of our streets, their prosperity, or our freedom, or our future. So I want to say again, coming here to [GPE] [TIME], it is time. It is time for freedom loving [NORP] to stand up and say, No more. It is time for freedom loving [NORP] to unite behind an agenda that will bring [GPE] back. And we do not have to speculate about what that agenda is. For all of my years in this movement, I actually first ran for [ORG] when one of the namesakes of this dinner was still in [FAC]. I had a chance to meet President [PERSON] in [FAC], my wife and I met him. I will never forget, I sat down next to him. I mean, [PERSON] was the reason why I joined [ORG], maybe like many of you. But I sat down next to him, felt like I was talking to Mount Rushmore. And I said, Mr. President, I, I said, I just want to thank you for everything you have done for this country and to encourage my generation to believe in this country again. And for all of my life, I will believe in that moment, that the 40th President of [GPE] blushed and said, Well, [SPEAKER], that is a very nice thing of you to say. But President [PERSON] articulated an agenda that he never took credit for, because it was an [NORP] agenda. He said, People say I am a great communicator. He said, I am not a great communicator, I just communicated great things, And President [PERSON] did the same. There is an agenda of a strong and prosperous [GPE] built on freedom, and that is our agenda. The truth is [ORG] has now become the home party for the [NORP] agenda. An agenda that believes in a strong national defense in a limited federal government in life, and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is all fallen to us. We have been blessed in this nation. And to whom much is given, much will be required. And you are here [TIME], because you know we have an obligation as they did in their time to do in our time, to stand strong for that positive [NORP] agenda, a strong military, secure borders, free enterprise, safe neighborhoods, support for law enforcement, [GPE] first trade deal, judges that uphold all of our God-given liberties, to fight for the opportunity of every [NORP] to choose where their children go to school, whether it is public, private, or parochial. And we, as [NORP], recognize that at the center of our Republic, at the center of our democratic institutions is the principle of [CARDINAL] person, [CARDINAL] vote. And it will be our party that makes it clear that election integrity is a national imperative, but a state responsibility. I mean, the truth is after an election that saw several states around the country literally set aside laws enacted by their legislature, now is the time for states to ensure that [CARDINAL] person, [CARDINAL] vote principle, that it is a center of our system, is protected and guaranteed. And make no mistake about it, that principal's under threat. Under the leadership of [PERSON], the [NORP] in [GPE] want to nationalize our elections with their bill called H.R. 1. They want to literally codify many of the very practices that create the greatest opportunity for fraud. I mean, none other than [GPE] legendary Secretary of [ORG] [PERSON] probably put it best. He said [PERSON] election bill, which the [ORG] will take up [DATE], is a egregious overreach of federal authority that would render the [GPE] Constitution null and void. Well, let me make you a promise, with your support, and your efforts, and the efforts of [NORP] all across this nation, we are not going to let [PERSON] override [GPE] Constitution or the state constitution of any state. And we will never let [PERSON] take the first in the nation primary from [GPE]! Our founders had a debate at [ORG], Mr. [PERSON], you know this, about where elections ought to be governed. He says, Right here at the state level, not in [GPE]. It is at the very center of our system and we are going to stand up and that system. We are going to defend state-based election reform, we are going to support voter ID, and we are going to work [DATE] to restore the confidence of every [NORP] in every vote. And beyond all of that, having to do with prosperity, and security, and the integrity of the ballot, ours will be the party that stands for the religious liberty of every [NORP] of every faith, and we will defend the right to life. Men and women's security, prosperity, educational opportunity for every [NORP]. Election security, and freedom, and our values, that is our agenda, and that is a winning agenda. That is a winning agenda that will unite our country, restore our future. And that is an agenda that'll win back [GPE]. I have no doubt in my heart. So [TIME] in [GPE], I want you to be encouraged, I really do, because I am more confident than ever that victory is right around the corner, and not just the down-ballot victories that you delivered here in [GPE] in [DATE], but victories up and down the ballot, because we have seen this movie before. Sure. It was [DATE] the last time I was at the Hillsborough County Republican Lincoln Reagan Dinner. I was serving as chairman of the [ORG] [NORP] conference. We were in the minority. There was a new [NORP] president advancing a liberal agenda. There was a [NORP] majority in the [ORG] and [NORP] majority in [ORG]. Coming here to the Hillsborough County Republican Party Dinner, I just knew that if we offered a positive conservative agenda to the [NORP] people, we'd win back the [ORG], we'd win back the [ORG], we'd win back [GPE]. We'd win back the [ORG], we'd win back [GPE]. And that is just what we did. And we are going to do it again in [DATE] and [DATE]. Believe it. We have just got to do a couple of things. We have got to tell our story and we have got to come together. Tell your neighbors and friends. Hey, I ran into [SPEAKER] [DATE]. He comes around [DATE]. I mean, that guy, like [CARDINAL] his speech was just talking about everything we got done in [DATE] of our administration, and then steered this nation through one of the greatest challenges of [DATE] in [DATE]. I mean, we do not have to accept a future of socialist decline and moral decay. What we proved in [DATE] is we can be a nation built on freedom whose government exists to serve its citizens, not the other way around. We can elect leadership that puts [GPE] and the [NORP] people first. And we can be a nation where every [NORP] has the freedom to live, to work, to worship according to the dictates of our conscience. We can be a live free or die nation. We proved it. But we have got to tell our story and we have got to do [CARDINAL] more thing. We have all been through a lot over [DATE], a global pandemic, civil unrest, a divisive election and tragedy at our nation's [FAC]. As I said [DATE], [DATE] was [DATE] in the history of the [GPE] [FAC]. But thanks to the swift action of [ORG] and federal law enforcement, violence was quelled, the [FAC] was secured, and [DATE] we reconvened the [ORG] and did our duty under the Constitution and the laws of [GPE]. President [PERSON] and I have spoken many times since we left office. And I do not know if we will ever see eye-to-eye on [DATE], but I will always be proud of what we accomplished for the [NORP] people over [DATE]. I will not allow [NORP] or their allies in the media to use [DATE] to discredit the aspirations of [CARDINAL] of [NORP], or allow [NORP] or their allies in the media to distract our attention from a new administration intent on dividing our country to advance their radical agenda. My fellow [NORP], for our country, for our future, for our children and our grandchildren, we must move forward united. [PERSON] probably said it best in [DATE] after he'd come up short for the Republican Convention. He was called to the podium by President [PERSON]. And he said words that I think speak to our party and our movement [DATE]. [PERSON] said, We have got to quit talking to each other and about each other, and go out and communicate to the world and carry them the message they have been waiting to hear. That is our challenge. So let us press on. Let us press on with a positive agenda. Let us tell the story to our neighbors and friends of everything we were able to accomplish when we put [NORP] conservative principles into practice in a short period of time, and made a stronger and more prosperous and more secure [GPE]. As the Bible says, forgetting what is behind, let us strain toward what is ahead. Compelled by that energy that has worked so powerfully in the hearts of generations of [NORP]. We have got to keep the faith. We have got to keep faith with our founders and our highest ideals. We have got to defend the freedoms enshrined in our declaration and our constitution, and be ready to keep our oath even when it hurts, as the good book says. We have got to keep faith with [CARDINAL] [NORP] who believe we could be prosperous again, who believe we could be strong again and deliver for ourselves and our prosperity a record. Proved it could happen. And lastly, we have got to keep faith with him who has ever guided this miracle of democracy on these wilderness shores. Keep faith that he is still with the good people of this nation [DATE]. So will ever be. God is not done with [GPE] yet. I just know in those ancient words that has always been true, that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray and turn and seek his face, he will do like he is always done. In much more challenging times than we could possibly imagine, he will hear from heaven and he will heal this land. This [CARDINAL] nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsremarksmakeamericagreatagainrallyduluthminnesota", "text": "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, [GPE]. Thank you very much. I am thrilled to be back in the great State of [GPE], with truly some of the most incredible people anywhere on Earth. You know that. And you know, I hate to bring this up-[laughter]-but we came this close to winning [GPE]. And in [DATE], it is going to be really easy, I think. Really easy. It is been [DATE] since a [NORP] did that, and I thought I was going to do it. I needed [CARDINAL] more visit, [CARDINAL] more speech. That is why never give up. Never, ever give up. [CARDINAL] more speech. No, we are very proud of [GPE]. Let me also say congratulations to the [ORG] on winning the NCAA Championship hockey tournament. Wow, that is a big deal. Right in this arena. This is where they play, right? Boy, I hear they are a great team. And how many are going to the [ORG]? [Laughter] How many? [CARDINAL]? [CARDINAL]? That is a lot. They are going to do it. Great team. Thank you. Great team. The [ORG]. So we are honored to be joined [TIME] by many wonderful [NORP] leaders, including our incredible [ORG] Majority Leader [PERSON]. [PERSON], come up please. Where is [PERSON]? Where is he? [PERSON]. He sends a lot of money this way, I want to tell you. I also want to thank and maybe just ask him to come up-we have [TIME] long, right? [Laughter] Do we have time? [TIME]. We are not going anywhere. Some great people. Congressman [PERSON]. Great champion. Come up, [PERSON]. Come up. Great champion. You know, there-you know, the whole thing going up the trees and down the trees. Number [CARDINAL] in the world for [DATE]. Come here. With a great, great wife by the way. Very talented. [Laughter] [PERSON], Congressman, loves this State. And a very popular man in the State of [GPE], [PERSON]. I also want to thank Lieutenant Governor [PERSON] for being here. She has been so great. Got a big race coming along. It is going to do great. Along with [ORG] Senator [PERSON]. [PERSON]. Come on up here. Get them up here. Where are you? Stay there. It is too much of a deal. Good luck, [PERSON]. Good luck, [PERSON]. Thank you. Also, a friend of mine and a man who is been incredible and a great supporter, [ORG] Majority Leader [PERSON]. And [ORG] Chair [PERSON], who has been fantastic. Thank you. Thank you. And finally, the person we are all here to support [TIME], somebody who is very special-by the way, loves ice hockey-[laughter]-real ice hockey family. In fact, his brother, you know, the coach of the winning women's team in the Olympics. Not bad. Great family. The next Congressman from [GPE]'s Eighth Congressional District, the great [PERSON]. Come on up. I will tell you, is this a pretty good sendoff for [PERSON]? This is not bad, right? Hey, [PERSON]. Come here. Say a few words. He was not supposed to do this, but let us hear him. Right? [Laughter] Come on. Come on. [NORP] congressional candidate [PERSON]. Thank you, Mr. President. Welcome to the city of [GPE] and the great [GPE] of [GPE]. And as you alluded to, the home of college hockey's [ORG], [ORG]. I am [PERSON], and I am running in [GPE]'s Eighth Congressional District because, like President [PERSON], I love this country. I love our freedoms. And I love our Constitution. Mr. President, before your election, you made a promise to visit [GPE]. And you promised more jobs, fewer regulations, and a better economy for everyone. Now, jobs are up, unemployment numbers are at a historic low, small businesses and manufacturers are surging, and optimism is at an alltime high. My blue-collar, commonsense conservative message is resonating throughout the 8th District. Mr. President, these people support you. And, Mr. President, these are the same people that are going to send me to [GPE] so together we can unleash the economic engine in Northern [GPE]. On behalf of the [NORP] here [DATE], thank you for coming to our great [GPE] and for always putting America-- So I did not know he was going to do that, and then he takes out a speech and reads it. I said, That is pretty good. [Laughter] He is a great guy, and he loves you, and he loves this country. And he is going to do fantastically. He is going to win. We are going to keep on winning. Remember, I used to say in a little jest, but I really meant it, We are going to win so much. Remember? We are going to win, win, win. It is what we are doing. Remember? I said, your Governor or your Senator or [PERSON] or somebody, they are going to come into [GPE] say: Mr. [PERSON], please, we are winning too much. The people of [GPE] cannot stand winning so much. Please, can we take it easy? And I said, No, we are going to keep winning, winning, winning. So we have created [CARDINAL] new jobs since [DATE]. And I have said before, if I would have said that to you during the campaign, those very dishonest people back there, the fake news-- Very dishonest. They would have said, He is exaggerating. These are very dishonest people. Many of them. And we have some people, too, doing that. But there is a lot of very dishonest people. For instance, I just got back, as you know, from [GPE], where I met [PERSON]. And we had a great meeting, great chemistry. We got along really well, which is very important. They did not want us too. But they-you know, it is like nice to do that. And very interestingly, at first everybody was amazed-amazed that we had the meeting. They could not believe it [TIME]. They said, I cannot believe it. You remember that, a while ago? They said, They are going to meet. Then, [DATE], they said: What is the big deal with the meeting? What is the big deal? In other words, their bosses said, You cannot say that. But the beauty was this: So we had a meeting. It was an incredible success. And they said: The President gave away so much. He met with them. I said, What else? That was-I met. What am I supposed to do? I have to meet. Right? He met. Now, sentence [CARDINAL] says, a total denuclearization of [GPE]. That is what it says. We got back our hostages. And I did not pay [MONEY] to get back our hostages. Paid-- We got back our great fallen heroes, the remains. In fact, [DATE] already [CARDINAL] have been sent back. They stopped shooting missiles over [GPE]. They stopped all nuclear testing. They stopped nuclear research. They stopped rocketry. They stopped everything that you'd want them to stop. And they blew up sites where they test and do the testing. And it was a great meeting. And [PERSON] will turn down-and I will tell-he will turn-Chairman [PERSON] will turn that country into a great, successful country. And let me tell you, and let me tell you-let me tell you this: [DATE], nobody thought that was possible. In fact, before I was elected, everybody assumed we were going to war. It would be a vicious war. In [GPE], you have [CARDINAL] people living [QUANTITY] off the border. They do not even need nuclear weapons for that. They have [CARDINAL] of cannons aiming right on top of [GPE]. You could have lost [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] of people. But I got along with [PERSON]. I got along. And that is a good thing, not a bad thing. And these people-you remember, I said, I cannot believe it- He is given away so much. You know what I gave away? A meeting. [Laughter] That was a meeting. And the fact that we do get along means we are safe. I am not saying things cannot happen. Things go wrong. Mistakes are made. Relationships get broken. But right now you are so safe, and such a great event took place. And all over Asia, they are celebrating the great achievement that we made because you were the ones that put me here. We made-that we made-all over Asia. And really all over the world. And by the way, in our country. Everybody knows what a great achievement this is not only for us, but for [GPE], for [GPE], for [GPE], for [GPE], for everybody. And I have to say, you know, you have been reading where I have been putting very large tariffs on [GPE]. Very, very large. We hit the [MONEY] mark. But I want to say, and we have to do that because it has to be balanced, it has to be fair. It was not fair. [GPE] and President [PERSON] has really helped us a lot at the border of [GPE]. Really helped us a lot, and he is a friend of mine. He is a friend of mine. So you should be very proud of yourselves for what took place, because that was very close to war for [DATE]. [DATE], it was very, very close. And now we can have something where everybody is going to live in peace for a long period of time. And there will be denuclearization. So that is the real story. Thank you. That is the real story. That is the real story. So unemployment numbers are among the best in the history of our country. [NORP] unemployment is at its lowest level in the history of our country. [NORP] unemployment has reached its lowest level ever recorded-the history of our country. And remember I'd go into big stadiums like this that were packed? And by the way, you are very good at real estate. Did you see the [CARDINAL] of people outside? That will never be reported by the fake news. But the [CARDINAL] of people that could not get in. [CARDINAL]. They are all over. The parking lots. They are all over. And it would be great if the cameras could take a shot of the arena. So usually, they do not do it. And I usually go home and my wife would say, How was the crowd? Although honestly, when you have [CARDINAL] of people like we have [TIME]-you know, I was at an event [DATE] where a person from [ORG] said, There was [CARDINAL] people. And the people-[CARDINAL] that were there protested. I did not even have to do it. And they wrote a slight correction. They were off by many [CARDINAL] of people. That is the way it is. It is fake news, I am telling you. So fake. But usually, they do not show the arena. They just show my face. So people would say, Did you have many people there? Um, did not you see? No, no. They have only showed your face. And we all have ego, but I do not want to show my face. I want to show the crowds. It is much prettier. Because you people are incredible. Unemployment among women has reached the lowest level, as of [DATE], in [DATE]. [DATE]. And most importantly of all, [GPE] is respected again. We are respected. We are fighting to protect [NORP] iron, aluminum, and steel and to protect our incredible and very brave miners. But I will tell you, to keep this incredible momentum, I think maybe the most successful that the country has ever had. I think we are now at the most successful level that the country has ever seen. That is how we are doing. And let me just tell you, because I hear a couple of the fakers, [DATE], said, Well, I think it is [PERSON]'s economy. [PERSON]'s economy? [PERSON]? They want to put on more regulations. They want to take back your tax cuts, which are massive. They want to take them back, and they want to raise the hell out of your taxes. And the whole thing will go boom. So we need more [NORP]. We have got to get out there in the midterm. We have got to get more [NORP]. Got to get more [NORP]. A vote for a [NORP] for [ORG] is really a vote for [PERSON] and her radical agenda. [NORP] want to raise your taxes; increase your regulations; shut down [NORP] energy; take over [NORP] health care, which has been a disaster with [ORG]; and ship away [NORP] jobs. And that is what they will do. If anything bad happens to this country, it will be a disaster for all of you. But we are not going to let it happen. We worked too hard to get here. And the greatest phrase, I think, in the history of politics is on all of those red and white hats that I see out there: Make [GPE] Great Again. And that is exactly what we are doing. Make [GPE] great again. And you know what our new phrase is in [DATE]. You know what it is, right? Keep [GPE] Great. That is what it is. Because that is what we are. So the [NORP] want open borders. Let everybody come in. Let everybody pour in. We do not care. Let them come in from the Middle East; let them come in from all over the place. We do not care. We are not going to let it happen. And by the way, [DATE] I signed an Executive order. We are going to keep families together, but the border is going to be just as tough as it is been. [NORP] do not care about the impact of uncontrolled migration on your communities, your schools, your hospitals, your jobs, or your safety. [NORP] put illegal immigrants before they put [NORP] citizens. What the hell is going on? Illegal immigration costs our country [MONEY]. So imagine if we could spend that money to help bring opportunity to our inner cities and our rural communities and our roads and our highways and our schools. So we have already started the wall. We got [MONEY]. The wall has been started. [GPE] and lots of different places. And we go-but, boy, it is tough. They want to do anything they can to obstruct and to make sure it does not happen. But it is happening. It is happening. Oh, we have a single protestor. There he goes. Goodbye, darling. Goodbye, darling. So we have a single protestor. He is going home to his mom. Say hello to mommy. And [DATE] the fake news will say [DATE], Massive protests at the [PERSON] rally. [CARDINAL] person. Massive protests. [PERSON]. So we are going to make it great for [NORP]. And we are going to take care of people. And we do want people coming across our border, going through our ports of entry, but we want people to come in through merit, not just through luck or happenstance. We want them to come in through merit. And we need people, because we have so many companies now-and you know very well in [GPE] what is happening. They just gave me a runthrough. What is happening in [GPE] is incredible. But we have so many companies moving back into our country. We need people to help, but we want them to come in through the merit system, not a system where we get MS-13 and everybody else that other countries do not want. And the [NORP]' open border policies have also allowed MS-13 to break into our country and drugs to pour into our streets. And we are stopping it. We have taken out of our country-and actually-can you believe I have to say this-we have liberated towns. Liberated. Like it was captured by a foreign country. We have liberated towns out in Long Island. MS-13, gangs. We have taken them out of our country by the [CARDINAL]. And these countries that send them back, we are putting in legislation-we are not giving them anymore aid. When they send people up. Remember the original speech-right? My original speech. They are sending-you remember those words? Everyone said, Oh, how terrible. They are sending-well, let me tell you, they are sending-and they are not sending their finest. That I can tell you. And we are sending them the hell back. And what we are doing-what we are doing-we give [MONEY] of aid to countries. We have a horrible deal, as an example, with [ORG] and [GPE]. Horrible deal. They make [MONEY] on that horrible trade deal where factories were emptied. So many bad things have happened, and we are going to make it a part of NAFTA. Because you have to mark up [QUANTITY] coming through [GPE]-you come up [QUANTITY] coming through [GPE], and we are going to stop it. Go home to your mom, darling. Go home. Get him out of here. Out. Was that a man or a woman? Because he needs a haircut more than I do. It is true. I could not tell. I could not tell. I could not tell. Needs a haircut. But the media never talks about the [NORP] victims of illegal immigration. I know them well. I know so many of them. I campaigned with them. What is happened to their children, what is happened to their husbands, what is happened to their wives. The media does not talk about the [NORP] families permanently separated from their loved ones because [NORP] policies release violent criminals into our communities. We need safety. We need safety. They do not bring cameras to interview the angel moms whose children were killed by criminal aliens who should have never been here in the first place, not even close. They do not want to talk to the angel moms. But as your President, I will always fight to protect [NORP] families. Always. I will always fight for an immigration system that defends our borders and takes care of our sovereignty as a nation. I will never sacrifice the safety and security of the [NORP] people. And I will never be silent in the face of vicious smears and attacks and the heroic agents and officers of [ORG] and [ORG] who save [CARDINAL]-just the job they do-save [CARDINAL] and thousands of lives and are so brave and are so tough. If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration, then you need to retire the [NORP] and elect [NORP] to finally secure our borders. Because we need [NORP] votes. We have a majority of [CARDINAL] in the [ORG]. We need [NORP] votes in the [ORG]. We need additional votes in the [ORG]. We will have the greatest borders, the greatest walls. We have already started, but it is a lot tougher than it needs to be. We need [NORP] to get out and put [NORP] in. In case you do not know, in the [ORG], we need, unfortunately, [CARDINAL] votes. We have [CARDINAL] votes. We need [NORP]. They will do anything to obstruct, anything to make it as uncomfortable as possible. Because they think it is good politics. I actually think it is bad politics. We will see very soon. We are building it. We are building the wall. That wall is happening. Under the previous administration, [GPE]'s rich, natural resources-of which your State has a lot-were put under lock and key, including [CARDINAL] of acres in [FAC]. You know what that is, right? [TIME] I am proudly announcing that we will soon be taking the first steps to rescind the [ORG] withdrawal in [FAC] and restore mineral exploration for our amazing people and miners and workers and for the people of [GPE], [CARDINAL] of the great natural reserves of the world. And we will do it carefully. And maybe, if it does not pass muster, we will not do it all. But it is going to happen, I will tell you. It is going to happen. And it is happening fast. We have already taken it, as you know, a long way down the road. And it is going to make things better. It is going to make it, from an environmental standpoint, better. As a result of our massive tax cuts, [CARDINAL] of [NORP] are receiving much bigger paychecks. Much bigger. We have eliminated record numbers of job-killing regulations. By the way-so, [DATE], it was [DATE]. So now it is , like, [CARDINAL]. In [DATE], we have cut more regulations than any President in the history of our country, whether it is [DATE], [DATE], or in [DATE]-in [CARDINAL] case, [DATE]. We have cut more regulations in [DATE] than any President, even our [DATE] President. We have opened up energy exploration in [FAC] in [GPE]. They have been trying to do that from before [DATE] of [PERSON]. Could not get it done. We repealed the core of [ORG]. The individual mandate is gone. So unpopular. The individual mandate where you pay a fortune for the privilege of not paying for insurance for health care. And let me tell you, we just repealed it. You do not have to pay anymore. So big. So big. And we would have repealed and replaced Obamacare, although we have gone a long way toward doing that anyway-we just had to do it a longer route. Because we had a gentleman, [TIME] [TIME], go thumbs down. That was not a good thing he did. That was not a good thing for our people, for our country, whether you are [NORP] or [NORP]. And everybody said: Oh, good. We have his vote. We have everybody's vote. We were going in for a routine repeal and replace, and he went thumbs down. Not nice. That was not nice. We are bringing back our jobs from other countries. We are bringing back our companies from other countries. [ORG] is coming back. [ORG] just announced they are coming back. Many, many companies are coming back to our country. They know where the action is. This is where they want to be. And as far as trade is concerned with other countries, we want fair and reciprocal trade. We do not want stupid trade like we had for so long. Stupid trade. Right? Remember the word reciprocal. Remember the word reciprocal. We have been ripped off by almost every country on Earth, our friends and our enemies. And I hate to say it, our friends do a bigger and better job than the enemies. [Laughter] But [DATE] are over. [DATE] are over. And even before we finish off with the trade deals-and we will finish off with the trade deals. People do not realize we have the cards. Because we are the piggy bank that everybody was robbing for [DATE]. [Laughter] We are like the piggy bank. Let us go get some more. You look at [ORG]. They put up barriers so that we cannot sell our farm products in. And yet they sell [ORG] and [ORG] and the cars come in by the [CARDINAL]. And we hardly tax them at all. They do not take our cars. And if they do, the tax is massive. So they are basically saying: We are going to sell you [CARDINAL] of cars. By the way, you are not going to sell us any. Not going to work that way anymore, folks. Not going to work that way. We will not be taken advantage of anymore. We are a great country. We are going to be an even greater country. Hopefully, greater than we have ever been before. We have such potential. We just secured [MONEY] in funding to rebuild our military, which was in very sad shape. And we have approval for [DATE]: [MONEY]. We are ordering new planes. We make the best in the world. We are ordering new ships. We are ordering new military equipment. And we even gave our great warriors a raise. Gave them a raise. For the veterans, we passed the largest [ORG] reforms in [DATE]. A landmark [ORG] law. You know what that is. You could not fire anybody that worked in the [ORG]. They were sadistic in some cases, they were lazy, they were this, they were that. Lots of different things. You could never fire anybody, because the accountability, you could forget it. So we passed a bill that they have been trying to pass for [DATE]. It is called [ORG], where now you bring the person into the office and you say: [PERSON], I am sorry to tell you, you are fired. Get out of here. Boom. Right? And even more important-and I did not think I'd be saying this so soon because I would campaign on this-I used to go out during the campaigns-and you know it because I was in [GPE] a lot. But obviously, [CARDINAL] more trip. [Laughter] [PERSON]. That will not happen again. But one that is really important to me. And I used to say to myself, I wonder why doctors do not just take care of our great vets. We just passed [ORG] legislation. Passed, signed. That gives our veterans the care they deserve, the care they earned. Now look, so our veterans were waiting on line for [DATE], for [DATE], for [DATE]. Someone on line with a minor problem, they ended up having a terminal disease. Now, I said during the campaign, before I knew too much about it, but there is a lot of common sense in life. I say, instead of [CARDINAL] of our great veterans waiting for [DATE], why do not we let them go see a doctor and pay the bill? And that is what we are doing. That is [ORG]. That is [ORG]. And you know, I went to people-I thought about it-I thought, oh, I think I am such a genius. Okay. I thought this was the-like, the greatest idea. But I went to the vet groups, I went to every- Yes, we have been trying to get that passed, sir, for [DATE]. Okay? I did not know that. But what I did know is, I knew how to get it passed, and we got it passed. [DATE]. And by the way, we passed another one. It is called right to try. You know what right to try is? Very proud of it, right to try. These are people that are terminally ill. It is sad. They travel all over the world if they have the money. If they do not , they do not know what to do. If we have drugs that have not been approved yet, but are showing tremendous promise, it did not matter. It did not matter how sick you were, where you were. You could not get it. And the reason was, they did not want to do anything that is going to hurt you. You are not going to be around for [DATE]. In [DATE]-I kept saying, Why cannot we do something? If people had the money, they'd travel to Africa, to Asia, to Europe trying to find the cure. It was called hope. They wanted hope. And they could not get it. I said it is ridiculous. I got involved. And this is also-like [ORG], for [DATE] people have tried pass it. And [PERSON] was a great help, I have to tell you. [PERSON], who just left the stage, was a great help. So were your Congressmen. A great help. And we got right to try passed. And [DATE], I signed final legislation, and we are very proud. And many people are going to be saved. Many, many people are going to be saved. And you'd think it would be easy, but it was not . Between the insurance companies and the health care companies and the pharmaceutical companies, it was incredible. But we did that, and now we are bringing down the prices for prescription drugs, way down. So we have made this incredible progress together with your help, with the help of [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] of people that-well, some polls got it right. But not all polls got it right. But they showed up, and [TIME], people are saying, You know, this could be a big problem for the [NORP]. They were not liking what they were seeing. They were seeing too many of those hats. They were seeing too many people with-you know that. That was [TIME]. That was [CARDINAL] of the most incredible [TIME]. Because that is a movement, the likes of which this country has never seen before. This country has never seen. You know, we talk about the forgotten men and women. They are the smartest people. They work the hardest. They pay taxes. They do all of the things. And yet they were the forgotten people. And believe me, our people are the smartest and the hardest working. Smarter than anybody, and the hardest working. You know, a little thing I was talking about [DATE]. You ever notice they always call the other side-and they do this on- the elite. The elite. [Laughter] Why are they elite? I have a much better apartment than they do. I am smarter than they are. I am richer than they are. I became President, and they did not . And I am representing the greatest, smartest, most loyal, best people on Earth: the deplorables. Remember that? The deplorables. Oh! You know, I was watching when Crooked [PERSON] made-and by the way, is it-[laughter]-hey, excuse me. Have you been seeing-- Have you been watching what is been going on with the Inspector General's report? What a scam this whole thing is? Okay? How guilty is she? With [PERSON] and his lover, [PERSON]. I do not think their wife and husband are too happy about that. What do you think? What do you think? I do not think so. No, but have you been seeing this whole scam? Have you been-do you believe what you are seeing? How-no matter what she did, no matter how many crimes she committed, which were numerous, they wanted her to be innocent. With me, nothing. No collusion, no nothing. And they just wanted to take all of us. They wanted to put us in trouble. And it is not working too well, I will tell you. Disgusting. Called the phony witch hunt. Phony witch hunt. But you look at the corruption. Did you ever see anything like it? Really, [DATE] more things-that is why they are building up immigration so you cannot see what is going on in [ORG]. They are building up immigration. They do not want to show what is happening in [ORG] where this whole scam has been revealed. So they want to stay on immigration where [PERSON] had bigger problems than anybody, where [PERSON] had problems, where other Presidents-they want to stay on immigration because they do not want to go into the halls of [ORG], which has totally revealed the [NORP] scam that is going on. What a group. What a group. I will tell you something, we want to get along with [GPE]. But [GPE] is looking out, and they are saying, Man, I wish she won. Between our military, our oil that we are doing. She wanted to have windmills. You know? We want to compete with the oil. All the things we have done. All the things we have done, including sanctions. So many things. They are looking back, they are saying: You know, I wish Crooked [PERSON] won that election. It would have been a lot better for [GPE]. [Laughter] So what we want to do is we want to elect more [NORP] so that we can deliver on all of the things I am talking about. And I will be honest with you, we are going to deliver anyway. We are going to really deliver anyway. We are going to lift [CARDINAL] of [NORP] from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. We are going to lift them. You know, one of the greatest things about all the jobs we have created-to me, the greatest-is that people now do not get stuck in one job and they hate it. They do not want to get up in [TIME]. They have many, many options. They can go out. Wages are rising. It is a beautiful thing taking place. They can get something-I have always said, you know, when I make speeches on how to be successful-I always say, like the first thing, you have got to love it. You have got to love it. You have got to love your job or you are never going to be good. These people now that did not have any options-they were hanging on to [CARDINAL] job that they hated. They have many, many choices. They get the job they want. And for the first time in [DATE], wages are rising. We are going to build new airports, and we are going to build railways and highways and waterways all across this magnificent land. We have spent, because of horrible decision-making, [MONEY] in the Middle East. Think of it. [CARDINAL]. And if we want to fix a window, it is , like, a big deal. [MONEY]. It is all coming back. Remember during the debates, I'd talk about growth. Growth. We need growth. Nobody has ever seen growth like we are having right now. When I go around and meet foreign leaders, they all congratulate me: Mr. President, congratulations on the growth of [GPE]. Congratulations. Every one of them. First thing they say. First thing they say. By the way, is there anything more fun than a [PERSON] rally? Is there? Seriously. And we break every attendance record every single time, just about. We are going to put new steel into the backbone of our country, and we are going to make that steel right here in [GPE]. We are going to breathe new hope into our communities. And our workers are already so proud again. We will do it all with [NORP] hands and [NORP] heart and [NORP] pride. And everything we do, we will stand up for our citizens. We will fight for our country. We will stand up for [GPE]. And we are going to stand up for the great State of [GPE]. And you are seeing that. Your great State was pioneered by men and women who braved the wilderness and the [DATE] to build a better life for themselves and for their incredible families. They were really tough, and they were really smart and strong. They did not have a lot of money; they did not have a lot of luxury. But they had grit, and they had faith, and they had courage, and they had each other. Right? They were miners and ministers and fishermen and farmers and shipbuilders and shopkeepers. But they all had one thing in common: They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God. Together, we are renewing the miracle of the great [NORP] Midwest. Do you remember not so long ago, we were producing those cars and we producing all of this stuff? And since then, so many companies went to [GPE] and went to other places. As I said before, they are coming back, and they are coming back faster than anybody could ever believe. We are standing on the shoulders of great [NORP] patriots who put down the railroads, built up the highways, and dug out the most amazing [FAC], losing [CARDINAL] of lives in doing it. They crossed the oceans, trekked the deserts, scaled the mountains, created the most incredible republic the world has ever seen. And you know what? Our Republic [DATE] is prouder and greater than it ever was before. Our beautiful ancestors won [CARDINAL] world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and put a man on the face of the Moon. And I think you saw [DATE], we are reopening [ORG]. We are going to be going to space. Space force. Space force. So we have the [ORG], the [ORG], [ORG], the [ORG], [ORG]. But we have [ORG]. Now we are going to have the space force, because it is a whole-we need it. We need it. As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, we will never, ever fail. There is no place like our place. There is no place. With your help and with your voice and with your vote, the [NORP] will win and keep on winning. We will keep on winning. We have great people. And [PERSON] is a great guy. You have got to get him a victory. Great guy. Got to get [PERSON] a victory. You have got to get him a victory. We need him. We will achieve victory for our magnificent country and our magnificent land, the land that we love. Because we are [NORP], and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. We will never give in, we will never give up, and we will never, ever stop fighting for our country or for our flag or for our freedom. We are [CARDINAL] people, one family, and one glorious Nation under God. And together, we will make [GPE] wealthy again. We will make [GPE] strong again. We will make [GPE] safe again. And we will make [GPE] great again. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, [GPE]. Thank you, [GPE].", "discourse_type": 0}

Here, [PERSON]. Ah. You are going to see that [TIME]. Right? Thank you very much, [PERSON]. You have been fantastic, and your kind words. This is truly an incredible organization. Thanks also to the members of [ORG]'s [ORG] who I have spent time with. Just took some wonderful pictures with good-looking group, I have to tell you. And Board Chairman [PERSON]. Thank you. Thank you, [PERSON]. Thank you. Together, you have been a powerful voice for [GPE]'s small businesses. And now you have a true friend and ally in [ORG]. You know that. You know that. I am honored to be with you [DATE] for, really, this historic celebration. This was something when they asked me to do, I did not think about it for [TIME] second. I said, I will do it. You are very special people. And let me officially say, on behalf of the [NORP] people, happy 75th anniversary to [ORG]. I tell you, you deserve a big happy. Joining us [DATE] are some terrific people who work very, very hard. And actually, they are starting to get a lot of credit. In fact, we had our highest poll numbers [DATE]. Can you believe this? So they are doing a good job. Our highest. You know the old story when I was campaigning, I only mentioned that when we were doing well in the polls. When we are not doing well, I do not talk about it. Like all of you. You do the same thing. Secretary [PERSON]. [PERSON], thank you very much. Doing a great job. Secretary [PERSON]. [PERSON]. And Administrator [PERSON]. Thank you, [PERSON]. Thank you. They are fighting hard for small business and for large business. They are fighting hard for our country, frankly, [DATE]. And they are doing a terrific job. Most importantly, I want to thank all of you, the small business owners, who are the engine of [NORP] prosperity. And, you know, I have been saying it for a long time, but you really are. You look at even the stats and you look at the numbers. You look at the taxes that are paid. You look at the jobs. It is all about small business. So small businesses, really I say this to [PERSON] all the time head of [ORG]. But small business is really big. Right, [PERSON]? It is really big. For [DATE], [GPE] tried to hold you back and tear you down, crushing the [NORP] small business with crippling taxes and oppressive regulation. But all that has changed starting in [DATE]. The [PERSON] administration is with you, and we are with you [PERCENT]. And always will be. Instead of punishing entrepreneurship, we are now promoting entrepreneurship. Especially that guy in the corner. Main Street is thriving and [GPE] is winning once again. You know, we are respected again. This country is respected again. Before going any further [DATE], I want to take [TIME] to address something you have been reading a lot about: the illegal immigration crisis on our southern border. It is been going on for [DATE] and [DATE]. And it has its ups and its downs. And all we need is good legislation, and we can have it taken care of. And we have to get the [NORP] to go ahead and work with us. Because as a result of [NORP]-supported loopholes in our federal laws, most illegal immigrant families and minors from Central America who arrive unlawfully at the border cannot be detained together or removed together, only released. These are crippling loopholes that cause family separation, which we do not want. As a result of these loopholes, [CARDINAL] illegal immigrant family units and minors from Central America have been released into [GPE] since [DATE] at unbelievably great taxpayer expense. Nobody knows how much we are paying for this monstrosity that is been created over [DATE] legislation that nobody has any idea what they are doing. They do not even know what it means. And you have to see this; it is [QUANTITY] high. Child smugglers exploit the loopholes, and they gain illegal entry into [GPE], putting countless children in danger on the perilous trek to [GPE]. They come up through [GPE]. [GPE] does nothing for us. You hear it here: They do nothing for us. They could stop it. They have very, very strong laws. Try staying in [GPE] for [DATE]. See how long that lasts. Okay? They do nothing for us, and I see it through [ORG]. I see with [MONEY]-plus that they make on trade through [ORG] one of the worst deals ever made by this country. A disaster. And we are trying to equalize it. And it is not easy, but we are getting there. It is not easy. And we are going to take care of our [NORP] farmers, and we are going to take care of our manufacturers, and our manufacturing jobs. But they are making unbelievable amounts of money, and that is not including the drugs that are flowing through our border, because we have no wall and we have no protection. The drugs that are coming in from [GPE] and through the southern border is disgraceful. So we will see whether or not we can make a reasonable [ORG] deal or deal does not have to be called NAFTA. We can do one-on-one with [GPE]; [CARDINAL]-on-one with [GPE]. And, by the way, [GPE] they like to talk. They are our great neighbor. They fought World War II with us. We appreciate it. They fought World War I with us. And we appreciate it, but we are protecting each other. There was a story [DATE], in a major newspaper, talking about people living in [GPE], coming into [GPE], and smuggling things back into [GPE] because the tariffs are so massive. The tariffs to get common items back into [GPE] are so high that they have to smuggle them in. They buy shoes, then they wear them. They scuff them up. They make them sound old or look old. No, we are treated horribly. Dairy. Dairy. [CARDINAL] percent tariff. So basically that is a barrier without saying it is a barrier. And I told them, if they do not change their ways and we have a tremendous deficit. People say, Well, there is really not that much of a deficit. Well, they are not including [CARDINAL] things: energy and timber. And those are the [CARDINAL] big things when it comes to [GPE]. No, we have to change our ways. We can no longer be the stupid country. We want to be the smart country. So hopefully, we will be able to work it out with [GPE]. We have very good relationships with [GPE]. We have for a long time. And hopefully, that will work out. But [GPE] is not going to take advantage of [GPE] any longer, and [GPE] is not going to take advantage of [GPE] any longer. And when I campaigned, I said I will either renegotiate NAFTA or I will terminate it and we will start from an even base. And people are afraid of that. You know, I have had so many people they come up, they say, Oh, please do not terminate NAFTA. I said, But it is no good. Yeah, but we know what we have. It is true. People are worried because they know what they have. If you look at I love the [NORP] farmer more than anybody. They have backed me. I love the [NORP] farmer. And by the way I will tell you in a little while because it is in [CARDINAL] of my notes the [NORP] farmer virtually will not have to pay any more estate tax on their farms when they pass away and they want to leave it to their children. And that goes for almost all small businesses. You will not have the estate tax to pay anymore, which was crippling. That was in our bill. See? A young guy is standing. Now, he is too young to be leaving it, so that means he is a beneficiary. I do not know. Do not act to happy. There is a wealthy father there. Do not act too happy. Is that your father? Oh, wow. The answer is yes. Okay. And you know what? You are both happy. Okay? You are both happy. And I am honored to have done it, because it was destroying the estate tax small businesses and farms. Destroying them. People were mortgaging them to the hilt to pay the tax, and then they could not pay the interest on the mortgage, and the banks would take them away. You do not have to pay the estate tax any longer. In most cases. In other words, loopholes if your farm is really big, you start to pay. It is a pretty big level, you know that. Pretty big. That would have to be a pretty big farm. These loopholes have created a massive child smuggling trade. Can you believe this? In this day and age, we are talking about child smuggling. We are talking about women smuggling in this day and age. The worst it is been in history because the Internet has led to this. You think back [DATE] the worst it is ever been. Women smuggling, child smuggling. Since [DATE], child smugglers who are very, very sophisticated they have learned the loopholes in this horrible, rotten system that the [NORP] have to help us fix because we need the votes. We could have the [NORP] votes, [PERCENT]. We still do not have enough votes. People do not understand that. We need [NORP] votes to get it fixed. These smugglers know these rules and regulations better than the people that drew them. As a result, there is been a [PERCENT] increase in minors, and a [PERCENT] increase in the smuggling or attempted smuggling of families and minors into our country. We are stopping them all the time by the [CARDINAL]. But they still get through. We have no wall. We have no border security. Without a border, you do not have a country. You do not have a country. Under current law, we have [CARDINAL] policy options to respond to this massive crisis: We can either release all illegal immigrant families and minors who show up at the border from Central America, or we can arrest the adults for the federal crime of illegal entry. Those are the only [CARDINAL] options. Totally open borders or criminal prosecution for law breaking. And you want to be able to do that. We do not want people pouring into our country. We want them to come in through the process, through the legal system. And we want, ultimately, a merit-based system where people come in based on merit. Keep in mind, those who apply for asylum, legally, at ports of entry, are not prosecuted. The fake news media back there does not talk about that. They are fake. They are helping they are helping these smugglers and these traffickers like nobody would believe. They know it. They know exactly what they are doing and it should be stopped because what is going on is very unfair to the people of our country. And they violate the law. People that come in violate the law. They endanger their children in the process. And frankly, they endanger all of our children. You see what happens with MS-13, where your sons and daughters are attacked violently. Kids that never even heard of such a thing are being attacked violently, not with guns, but with knives because it is much more painful. Inconceivable here we are talking about business inconceivable that we even have to talk about MS-13 and other gangs. They attack violently, the most painful way possible. And a bullet is too quick. And we are allowing these people into our country? Not with me. We are taking them out by the [CARDINAL]. We are taking them out by the [CARDINAL]. So what I am asking [ORG] to do is to give us a third option, which we have been requesting since [DATE] the legal authority to detain and promptly remove families together as a unit. We have to be able to do this. This is the only solution to the border crisis. We have to stop child smuggling. This is the way to do it. And ultimately, we have to have a real border not judges. [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] of judges they want to hire. Who are these people? When we vet a single federal judge, it goes through a big process. Everybody that is ever met her or him they come, they complain, they do not complain. They say he is brilliant; she is brilliant; he is not smart enough to be a judge. Now we are hiring [CARDINAL]. What country does this? Judges. I will not say it. I refuse to say it. I hope they picked that up back there. They will not . No, what seriously, what country does it? They said, Sir, we'd like to hire [CARDINAL] more judges. [CARDINAL]? Now, can you imagine the graft that must take place? You are all small business owners, so I know you can imagine a thing like that would happen. But here is a guy they say, Could you please be a judge? Come on, get it. They line up to be a judge. It is horrible. We do not want judges; we want security on the border. We do not want people coming in. We want them to come in through a legal process like everybody else that is waiting to come into our country. And it got so crazy that all of these [CARDINAL] we now have [CARDINAL] of judges border judges [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL]. And, by the way, when we release the people they never come back to the judge anyway. They are gone. They are in your system. That is it. If they are good, that is great. And if they are bad, you will have killings, you will have murders, you will have this, you will have that, and you will have crime. You will have crime. And remember, these countries that we give tremendous foreign aid to in many cases, they send these people up and they are not sending their finest. Does that sound familiar? Remember I made that speech and I was badly criticized? Oh it is so terrible, what he said. Turned out I was [PERCENT] right. That is why I got elected. We want a great country. We want a country with heart. But when people come up, they have to know they cannot get in, otherwise it is never going to stop. Whether it was President [PERSON], President [PERSON], President [PERSON] same policies. They cannot get them changed because both sides are always fighting. This is maybe a great chance to have a change. But [CARDINAL] of them says we want to hire [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] more judges. I do not want judges. I want border security. I do not want to try people. I do not want people coming in. Do you know, if a person comes in and puts [CARDINAL] foot on our ground, it is essentially welcome to [GPE], welcome to our country. You never get them out, because they take their name, they bring the name down, they file it, then they let the person go; they say show back up to court in [DATE]. [DATE]. But here is the thing: That in itself is ridiculous. Like [PERCENT] come back. The other thing they have is they have professional lawyers. Some are for good, others are do-gooders, and others are bad people. And they tell these people exactly what to say. They say, Say the following: they write it down I am being harmed in my country. My country is extremely dangerous. I fear for my life. Say that. Congratulations. You will never be removed. This is given to them by lawyers who are waiting for them to come up. And they are not all bad people. They are impractical people. But, in a way, that is cheating because they are giving them statements. They are not coming up for that reason. They are coming up for many other reasons and sometimes for that reason. There is been a [CARDINAL] 700 percent increase in asylum claims over [DATE]. Think of that. Think of that. We are a great country but you cannot do that. Smugglers know how the system works. They game the system; they game it. It is so easy for them. They are smart. They did not go to [ORG]. But you know what? They are really smart. [GPE] has just surpassed [GPE] as having the most asylum seekers of any nation on Earth. Can you image that? Can you image? And [GPE] we talk about [GPE] they allowed [CARDINAL] of people in. And, by the way, their crime, from the time they started, is up [PERCENT]. And that is one of the reasons it is at that level is because they do not like reporting that kind of crime, so they put it down as different kind of crime. But their crime is up [PERCENT] since they started taking them in. I heard somebody said that Crooked [PERSON] was questioning that statistic. She said, It is not true. It is not true. Did not she already have her chance? I mean, I have . I will tell you what, when you read the [ORG] report with these really dishonest people and I was never a deep-state guy, but let me tell you, we got some bad people that are doing bad things. But when you read that [ORG] report about how she got away with what she got away with, it is a disgrace. It is a total disgrace. And you ought to see the hearings that are right now on television but that folks are being you know, they are going on to the mainstream, fake news media. They want to focus on immigration because they want to keep the cameras away from the hearings because those hearings are not good for them. In fact, they are a disaster for them. The whole thing is a scam. It is a scam. And what is happened is a disgrace. So we have a [ORG] that is getting ready to finalize an immigration package that they are going to brief me on later, and that I am going to make changes to. We have [CARDINAL] chance to get it right. We might as well get it right, or let us just keep it going. But let us do it right. We have a chance. We want to solve this problem. We want to solve family separation. I do not want children taken away from parents. And when you prosecute the parents for coming in illegally, which should happen, you have to take the children away. Now, we do not have to prosecute them. But then we are not prosecuting them for coming in illegally. That is not good. We want to end the border crisis by finally giving us the legal authorities and the resources to detain and remove illegal immigrant families all together and bring them back to their country. We have to bring them back to their country. Now, think of all that aid that we give some of these countries. [MONEY] we give to some of these countries, and they send them up. Well, I am going to go, very shortly, for authorization that when countries abuse us by sending their people up not their best we are not going to give any more aid to those countries. Why the hell should we? Why should we? So this is a responsible, commonsense approach that all lawmakers should embrace [NORP] and [NORP]. And remember, we need the [NORP]. People say, Oh, you have the majority. Well, in the [ORG], we have [CARDINAL], but you need [CARDINAL]. So we will be at if we get [PERCENT], we will be at [CARDINAL]. [PERCENT], we will be at [CARDINAL]. So we need [CARDINAL] votes. We need [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] votes. We have to have [NORP] support because we need to go not just a majority, unfortunately, which we could get. We need to go to [CARDINAL] out of [CARDINAL]. We need [NORP] support. They do not want to give it, because [NORP] love open borders. Let the whole world come in. Let the whole world. MS-13 gang members from all over the place, come on in we have open borders. And they view that possibly intelligently, except that it is destroying our country. They view that as potential voters. Someday they are going to vote for [NORP]. Because they cannot win on their policies, which are horrible. They found that out in the last presidential election. In fact, their only policy was that [PERSON] is a bad guy, he is a bad person. Vote against [PERSON]. And they said it [MONEY] of negative ads. Nobody has ever been hit like that. I used to go home I started disliking myself. It is true. I said, Man, am I that bad? The problem is they never told anybody what they are doing. They did not talk about tax cuts. By the way, they want to take away your tax cuts, and they want to substantially increase your taxes. They did not talk about crime. All they talked about was [PERSON]. So when people got to the booth, they said, Ah, we are going to vote [NORP]. We are going to vote but then they get up, they said, But what does she stand for? What do they stand for? They just hate [PERSON]. No, I am going with [PERSON]. And that is what happened. We got tremendous [NORP] support. It was a beautiful thing. That was [TIME]. Do you agree? That was [TIME]. That was [TIME]. That was [TIME]. But you have to stand for something, and you have to stand for safety and security of our country. We cannot let people pour in. They have got to go through the process. And maybe it is politically correct, or maybe it is not. We got to stop separation of the families. But politically correct or not, we have a country that needs security, that needs safety, that has to be protected. So we are here [DATE] to talk about small business and the incredible progress we are making as a country. We really have made unbelievable progress. And we are making with the help and support of our wonderful friends at the [ORG]. And you have heard these numbers. And if I would have said these numbers during the campaign, the fake news would have said this is the most ridiculous I would not have said these numbers; I would have said [CARDINAL]. Who would have known? But things have kicked in better. And as an example, you saw the poll that was recently taken small-business poll. The most optimistic in history, in the history of the poll. That is why I figured that probably this would be a friendly crowd. But nobody would have believed these numbers if I said them during the campaign. We have created [CARDINAL] new jobs since [DATE]. [CARDINAL]. Think of what that means. And, by the way, we do need people coming through the border. We do need people. And again, we want people you know, I have a lot of companies moving in, big companies. If you look at [ORG] in [GPE], they are coming in. They need [CARDINAL] and thousands of people. [ORG] is moving from [GPE] back into [GPE]. Many car companies are coming back into our country. Many companies are coming back. They are coming back from where they went. Now they are coming because of all of the things we have done with regulations, with tax cutting. But we need people to take care. We have the lowest unemployment rate [PERCENT]. We need people. So we want people to come in, but they have to be people that can help us and can help these companies fulfill what they want to fulfill. Unemployment claims are at a [DATE] low. That is a great number. Maybe the one that makes me happiest is this because I remember I'd go around, I'd say, What do you have to lose? Vote for me. The [NORP] have always been with you. Vote for me. They have you know, bad education. The most unsafe parts of the country. All of these different I'd say to [NORP], I'd say, what you have to do What do you have to do? Vote for me. What do you have to lose? Unemployment for [NORP] is at the lowest level in history. It is like, what do you have to lose? I would go around and talk, and some people would say, do not say that, it is not nice. I'd say, look, it is true. So badly treated. And now the lowest level of unemployment in history for [NORP]. And for [NORP], the lowest level of unemployment in history. And for women, the lowest level of unemployment in [DATE]. Soon it will be history. Just like I promised during the campaign, our economic policy can be summed up in [CARDINAL] very beautiful words words that you probably know better than anybody in this country: jobs, jobs, jobs. And I should not say this to the people in this room, because you will end up not having liked my speech but wages for working people are finally, after [DATE], rising again in our country. I am sorry to do that. It is the only thing you can hold against me, but I think you are also very happy about it, actually. I know you well. According to the [ORG]'s latest survey, the share of small businesses raising worker and benefit pay has just set a new all-time record. So it is a new all-time record. We have broken many records. I could go on and on. Business optimism is the highest it is ever been in our country. That means more hardworking [NORP] are able to support their family, contribute to their community, and live the [NORP] Dream. At the center of [GPE]'s resurgence are the massive tax cuts that [NORP] passed and that I signed into law [DATE] [DATE]. Not [CARDINAL] [NORP] voted for the tax cuts, and they are suffering now because they are going to lose a lot of races that they thought they were going to win. They wish they had that vote to do over again. We have numerous states for [ORG] where I think they are going to be in big trouble. It is the biggest tax cut and reform in [NORP] history. And you know the story: Not since [PERSON] have they done any major tax cutting. And they have wanted to many, many times. I tell this story all the time. I said, I do not understand it. Cutting taxes should not be hard to sell. Right? Is there anything easier? We are going to cut your taxes. And you cannot get it through. So the leadership came to my beautiful [FAC]. It is a beautiful office. Great office. And they talked about the tax reform. I said, What is the word 'reform'? What does that mean, 'reform'? Does that mean you are going to raise taxes? What does it mean? No, sir. We have the Tax Reform Act of [DATE]. I said, No, I do not want to go 'reform.' Nobody knows what reform means. Then I looked back at all of the times they tried to pass tax cuts. They do not use the word tax cuts; they use the word tax reform. I said, Nobody knows what reform means. They want to know about tax cuts; they do not want to know about tax reform, where we are going to raise your taxes, where we are going to take away your businesses, you are going to take away because tax reform. We are going to take away your farms. They do not want the word reform. They want the word tax cuts. Sir, could you give us a name? I will give you the name. I will give you the name. It is called the Tax Cut, Cut, Cut, Cut, Cut Bill of [DATE]. That is what it is called. Right? That is a true story. Right, [PERSON]? That is such a true story. But even I thought that it was maybe a little bit hokey with all the cuts. So we just called it Tax Cut Bill. Got rid of some of the cuts. They got the word. And we got it passed. But think of it: Not [CARDINAL] [NORP] vote. At the heart of our plan is tremendous relief for working families and small businesses. A typical family of [CARDINAL] earning $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] a year will see an income tax cut of [MONEY] 000 in some cases, much more than that slashing their tax bill in [CARDINAL] and more. We delivered a historic victory for [NORP] small businesses by allowing you to deduct [PERCENT] of your business income. People were shocked. Capital investment is soaring on small businesses and big businesses, because you can now immediately deduct this, to me, is the greatest of them all [MONEY] spent on new capital equipment. [DATE]. Boom. Deduction. I think that is going to be the star. As you know, we are also bringing back [MONEY] from offshore that we could not bring back. The companies were unable to do it. From a tax standpoint, the amount they had to pay and almost more importantly, it was just very hard to do. You had to see the forms that had to be filled out. It was virtually impossible. So we had [MONEY], and now it seems as though, [PERSON], we are hitting the higher side. Companies are pouring money back into our country, bringing it back from overseas, investing it here. [ORG] just announced recently they are going to spend [MONEY] on an incredible campus and new facilities all over the country. They are bringing money back and like nobody ever thought before. And you have heard me say, when they said [MONEY], I said, You mean [MONEY]. Because [MONEY] builds a nice plant. I know how to build under budget and ahead of schedule. I can build a beautiful plant for a lot less than $350 million. So when I heard [CARDINAL], I said, No, no. You mean [MONEY], right? They said, No. Think of what that is. I think of the total amount they are bringing back [MONEY], and the rest they are putting in. Tremendous investment in our country. And [ORG] is doing the same thing and so many other countries [companies] are doing the same thing, different numbers. It is incredible what is happened. I still say, however, expensing [DATE] expensing will be the star of what we are doing. We exempted more small business owners from the alternative minimum tax, which you know very well was an enormous waste of your precious time and your very hard-earned money. That was a disastrous tax. And from now on, most small-business owners will be spared from the deeply unfair estate tax that I talked about. And it is so I am so proud of that, because you are all keeping your businesses. The family, the farms, you are keeping your businesses. As a result of all of these taxes and all of these tax cuts, [NORP] businesses now are on a level playing field with your competitors from other countries who have so many advantages, including subsidy by governments. You see what is happening with [GPE]. We have no choice. This should have been done [DATE]. We have no choice. [GPE] has been taking out [MONEY] a year out of our country and rebuilding [GPE]. I always say, We have rebuilt [GPE]. They have taken so much. It is time, folks. It is time. So we are going to get smart, and we are going to do it right. And we are actually getting a lot of support. But we have to do something about it. Now, maybe something happens where they come and they say, We agree, it is been unfair for [DATE]. But somehow, that does not seem to work so easily. But we are going and we are going to make it fair. We are going to make it fair with other countries, both our friends and our enemies. And I have to say this: In many cases, our friends, on trade, have treated us much worse than our enemies. Pretty amazing, is not it? But we know that when the rules are fair, and you can compete, you will win against anyone anywhere in the world. There is nobody like you. You are going to win anywhere. But you have to bring it down to a level playing field. [CARDINAL] workers have already received a bonus some by your people or a pay raise, or retirement account contribution, or a new job thanks to these tax cuts. A lot of new jobs. And people now are able to go around and look for jobs. They are just not taking a job and they hate it. They hate to wake up in [TIME]. They do not want to go to work. Now they have got their choice. They have jobs that they can look and they can love. And if you do not love it, you are not going to be good at it. [CARDINAL] of [NORP] are now saying, and really saying to everybody, that they are saving money on their [DATE] utility bills. As a result of our business tax cuts, [CARDINAL] utility companies have lowered their prices, saving [NORP] [MONEY] a year. Our historic tax cuts also ended [CARDINAL] of the most unfair taxes imaginable Obamacare's individual mandate. Government will no longer punish you if you cannot afford [ORG]'s sky-high premiums. Think of this: You pay a lot of money to the government in order not to have to buy in health insurance. Think of that. So you are paying money so that you do not that is a penalty. Incredibly, it was allowed. But you are paying money so that you do not have to buy healthcare. That was a beauty. It is over. It is gone. It is done. . And we actually thought we had the votes, and then [CARDINAL] man, very early in the morning, went thumbs down. So that was that. But we almost got rid of [ORG] without him. And that was [DATE] for [ORG]. That was [DATE] for the country when that vote was cast that final vote was cast. A thumbs down. I remember it well. [ORG] has been especially brutal for small businesses. You know that better than anybody. It caused premiums and deductibles to explode, and healthcare options to plummet. As a result of Obamacare, many small businesses, small-business employees, sole proprietors have no good or affordable options. But now they do, because we are opening up our system. I am proud to announce another truly historic step in our efforts to Americans from Obamacare and the [ORG] nightmare, and provide high-quality, affordable healthcare to every [NORP]. This is low-cost, great healthcare. You know, before Obamacare, there were many people very happy. They had no problem. But then you got thrown to the wind. [PERSON] is here. Stand up, [PERSON]. This is so important. This is his baby. Secretary of [ORG]. [PERSON] and [ORG] are taking a major action that is been worked on for [DATE] now and now it is ready to make it easier for small businesses to band together to negotiate lower prices for health insurance and escape some of Obamacare's most burdensome mandates through association health plans. You are going to save massive amounts of money and have much better healthcare. It is going to cost you much less. It is going to be, I think, fantastic. And it is very comprehensive. I will tell you, a lot of people big, big percentages of this country are going to be doing that. In fact, while you are in the room together, shake hands, form an association. Good luck. And in theory, the bigger the association, the better the deal you are going to make. You are going to save a fortune, and you are going to be able to give yourselves and your employees tremendous healthcare. I am really honored by that. Believe me, that is great. With this action, businesses in the same state or businesses in the same industry not just the same state anywhere in the country remember I used to say during the debates, Cross state lines so you can negotiate. You now can cross state lines so you can negotiate. So if [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] of the businesses in this room get together you get together as a group, an association you pick the meanest, most vicious manager owner to right? Right? To negotiate your healthcare and I know a few of the people in here that are going to do very well. They are they are wild. You will end up with better insurance for far less money. You will end up so great. And, [PERSON], that is ready as of when? [DATE]. Oh, that is not a bad answer. [DATE]. [DATE]. Stand up, [PERSON]. I call our Secretary of [ORG], and they say, Sir, he is very busy. I say, Wait [TIME]. I am President of [GPE]. What do you mean? They said, He is working on healthcare. I said, Well, [ORG]. That is interesting. And that is some great plan. We love it. Thank you, [PERSON]. Very committed to it. And he is now working on an expansion of that, including even larger groups of people. So that is really something that is also going to be very exciting. For the first time ever, sole proprietors will be able to come together and buy lower-cost group insurance instead of getting ripped off by this disaster that we all know as [ORG]. These actions will result in very low prices, much more choice, much more freedom, including in many cases new opportunities to purchase health insurance. You will be able to do this across state lines. That was such a big thing. I'd say, [PERSON], I want to cross state lines. He said, Do not worry about it. And nobody else you know, this is something we were able to do within the confines of the existing laws. It is a fantastic thing. So it is all set to go. Get going. Make your deals. And the insurance companies and some people are forming their own but the insurance companies are so excited about this. It is going to be very competitive. Let them go and they have made so much money off [ORG], folks. They got so rich with [PERSON]. Take a look at what happened to our premiums. You know, everyone hears about Obamacare being a disaster, except for the insurance companies. So they are going to have to give a little bit of that money back. Negotiate tough, please. Every [NORP] who owns a small business plays a vital role in creating a safe, strong, and prosperous [GPE]. And my administration will never forget that truth. [DATE] you turn ideas into action, you turn vision into creation I know you well and you turn dreams into reality. That is what you do. You do not even realize that is what you do. That is what you do. You embody the spirit of independence and adventure that turned [GPE] from [CARDINAL] colonies into the most incredible republic in the history of humankind. See, I do not mankind anymore; I say humankind. Do the women understand that? I do not know. They want me to be politically correct. What Oh, look, a couple of women are having the thumb up. Right? You like that? You like that. Okay. That is okay. Now I am happy about it. It is the same spirit that inspired previous generations to cross the plains and tame the wilderness, and to build shining cities that touch the sky. We stand on the shoulders of [NORP] patriots who built the great highways and railroads; who dug out [FAC]; who won [CARDINAL] world wars; and who put a man on the face of the moon. And if you see what I did [DATE] with [ORG], right? And you have [ORG], and now you will soon have [ORG], because that is where it is at space. That is where it is at. We will be the leader. Together, there is nothing [NORP] cannot do, because we are [CARDINAL] people and one family saluting one great [NORP] flag. Thank you. Our future has never looked brighter and that is because of the hardworking [NORP] like you and [CARDINAL] of small-business owners who took the chance to do what they love: to follow their hearts and to chase their very beautiful dreams. You are the ones who are shaping our industry. You are the ones who are shaping and restoring our prosperity. We are restoring our prosperity. You have seen GDP. You see what projections are who knows but numbers that nobody ever thought possible. I look so forward to seeing some of those numbers. But you see what projections are. People are projecting numbers like nobody thought even possible, numbers that I would likewise like I would not have said on jobs, I would not have said on growth I would not have said. Let us see what happens. But we are doing well as a country. And you are the ones, truly, who are making [GPE] great again. So happy anniversary. God bless you. And God bless [GPE]. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptscaliforniagovernorgavinnewsomcoronaviruspressconferenceannouncesclosureofbarsacrossstate", "text": "So we will update you on the latest numbers in [GPE]. We will walk through some new announcements and then of course here to catch up, answer any questions that you may have. The current number of people have tested positive in [GPE] is [CARDINAL], that is a [PERCENT] increase from [DATE]. Tragically, we now have [CARDINAL] individuals that have passed away from COVID-19, the novel Coronavirus. [GPE] has conducted [CARDINAL] tests, that includes our [CARDINAL] labs of which [CARDINAL] of those tests were done by our labs, but those labs, as I noted [DATE], had been supplemented by hospitals from [ORG] to a number of [ORG] [inaudible 00:01:05] as well as our private lab [ORG] in [GPE]. I will remind you that [ORG] currently is operating [CARDINAL] lab in [GPE] and conducting [CARDINAL] tests on a [DATE] basis. That will substantially ramp up in [DATE] or so with the [CARDINAL] additional labs that will come online. We will get those tests just from that commercial lab up to [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] a day. But the total number North of [CARDINAL][CARDINAL], and we are increasing our capacity on an [DATE] basis, not just a [DATE] basis. Accordingly, we have advanced a partnership that was initiated [DATE] with [ORG], the health and life science subsidiary of [ORG]. We advanced that partnership with the idea of bringing to market the capacity for individuals that have developed mild symptoms or are concerned about their status from the perspective of being a vulnerable population, being our seniors or higher risk of contracting the disease to give them the opportunity to go on this portal, to answer specific questions, to be scored in terms of their likelihood to be needed to be tested, and then be allowed and directed the opportunity to be tested at what will be at launch to specific sites, one in [GPE], one in [GPE]. That portal, that page that allows people to interface will go align [DATE] and we will then begin to make reservations, and people throughout the course of [DATE] will be in the opportunity to get the mobile testing that so many are discussing and so many have promoted. We expect that those [CARDINAL] pilots, [CARDINAL] in [GPE], [CARDINAL] in [GPE] will significantly expand other parts of the state. We have a deep eye and consciousness on the Central Valley, other parts of the state. We want to make sure, from not just a density of concern, [GPE] being [CARDINAL] of our top priorities as a county, that is the answer of why we are starting there, but more broadly that we look at the issues of social economics and access as a big part of the advancement of the [ORG] partnership. We hope that this partnership can scale and we believe it will be a national model. There is simply no other interface that exists in [GPE] that allows people a portal that has questions and the capacity to geospatially identify where people are so we can identify the closest areas for mobile testing that we are aware of in the country. And so we are very encouraged by this partnership, very enthusiastic to finally announce it. I know there is been some conversations about it in the media, but it is going live [DATE] in [TIME], fully operational in the first [CARDINAL] piloted areas in our state. We have the capacity currently through the assets in hand, be it swabs, [inaudible [TIME]] issue that I will discuss in a moment, the issue of swabs. Not just the issue of reagents, not just the issue of RNA extraction kits that are part of our testing regime, but also the availability of swabs. But the first troche we have [CARDINAL] test capacity with the swabs and we will partner with [ORG] in terms of the diagnostics of those tests. The turnaround is typical at [ORG], anywhere from [DATE], some cases [DATE], is roughly the estimate. People will be automatically notified based upon that screening criteria and based upon that interface on that portal of their test results. If people have severe symptoms, this is not where we want you to be tested. This is just a test. If you have severe symptoms, you need to engage the medical community directly. So we want to remind people, this is not to substitute that interface, but to supplement our capacity to get people that have some mild concerns and or people that are higher risks to remove them from overburdening our healthcare delivery system, to get them out of that setting and to allow people with the kind of portability that mobile testing provides to get answers quickly. But again, it is just a test, and so I just want to remind people of that framework and not promote it for something that it is not . So we are moving into next phase as it relates to testing in [GPE]. Broadly, I think in [GPE], there is still some capacity concerns. Not only on the diagnostic side, on the back end with the labs, both private, public, commercial, but as it relates to suppliers and one must be honest about that and forthright about it. But significant increases nonetheless in the testing protocols are being advanced, again, I think quite substantively with this new partnership. As it relates to the purpose of developing these partnerships, the purpose of our testing that is to identify through community surveillance where we are so that we could begin to process how we need to manage the status quo and how we need to anticipate the growth and spread of the virus and look at allocating resources across the state accordingly. I mentioned this [DATE]. I will remind folks, we have [CARDINAL] 000 hospital beds in the state at [CARDINAL] different hospitals. We have surge capacity in our state just shy of [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] beds, that is [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] beds to be exact, and that is on the basis of current survey that is very contemporary of the existing hospital system. We have [CARDINAL] ICU beds in our system, but that is not just for adults. That also includes pediatric ICUs. It is just shy of [CARDINAL] when you add the [CARDINAL] numbers up. We have new and detailed information about access to ventilators over [CARDINAL]. Not over. [CARDINAL] ventilators currently reside in our hospitals and we have procured new ventilators, [CARDINAL] that we were able to purchase, and we also have our own cash both through our [ORG] and our [ORG] sites that include [CARDINAL] ventilators, in addition to the [CARDINAL] that I referenced. So I give you those numbers because a lot of people have asked about that information. Those are the most up-to-date and contemporary numbers. I also make that point as a point of consideration and segue to the subsequent announcement, and that is as we manage this disease and the dynamic nature of this moment, we need to anticipate spread but we also need to prioritize our focus. The purpose of [DATE]'s announcement is to focus on specifically what we mean by that. Most important thing again is to protect the most vulnerable, protect our seniors. In [GPE], we estimate we [CARDINAL] [NORP] that are [DATE]. Of [CARDINAL] [DATE] and over, we are prioritizing their safety because of their unique vulnerabilities to this virus. We also are prioritizing those with chronic conditions and prioritizing our homeless, and it is in those [CARDINAL] areas that I want to advance some new considerations for the public, a new direction for the people of [GPE]. We are calling for the home isolation of all seniors in [GPE]. We are calling for the home isolation of all of [DATE] and older and those with chronic conditions. We are doing so with our eyes wide open at the magnitude of what that means and the need to provide wraparound services to support our seniors in need of medical supplies and need of meals and the like. The team assembled behind me and the people in this, what we refer to as soccer state operation center, of where we reside at the moment currently have [CARDINAL] task forces that are working on a panoply of issues from logistics, from things as basic as not just food but water, fuel and basic supplies to more complex issues related to workforce and the like. So we are looking at this from a very holistic perspective and holistic lens. We recognize that social isolation for [CARDINAL] of [NORP] is anxiety inducing, but we recognize what all of the science bears out and what we recognize around the rest of the world that we need to meet this moment head on and lean in, not isolate ourselves to this moment, but lean in and own this moment and take actions that we think are commensurate with the need to protect the most vulnerable [NORP]. Number [CARDINAL], we are directing at all bars, nightclubs, wineries, brewpubs and the like be closed in the State of [GPE]. We believe that this is a non essential function in our state, and we believe that is appropriate under the circumstances to move in that direction. As it relates to restaurants, we have more nuanced concerns and considerations. Some have suggested just shutting down all of our restaurants. We do not believe ultimately that is necessary at this moment. Consideration nonetheless is to socially distance patrons within these establishment, and as a consequence, we are directing that we reduce the current occupancy within these establishments by [CARDINAL], and we require social distancing within those establishments. We have quite some flexibility in that space and we could talk more about what that may look like, but in broad strokes, that is the current directive and we will in real time absorb the capacity to potentially do more but also try to reflect on the enforcement side of this, which I am not concerned about because as you had noted with all of our directives, we are seeing a socialization in real time and strong and broad support, not only from public health officials up and down the state, but the private sector that has done a remarkable job meeting this moment. So that is on the restaurant side. Let me just briefly make this point. There is a concern around access to food for those that cannot prepare their own food. Not everybody has kind of kitchen you or I may have, not everybody is capable of heating their food. Now we are talking about home isolation. Not everybody is able now to go out to grocery store to get that food. Some may have limited capacities relates to deliveries, but we want to expand the points of access to get those deliveries. Restaurants by definition provide those points of access. So having an organized construct that allows delivery of hot, prepared and nutritious food within an existing infrastructure we think is appropriate again to this moment with the additional steps on bars, nightclubs, wineries, brew pubs and the like. Number [CARDINAL], in relationship to seniors as our top priority and home isolation, as it relates to bars and new guidelines on restaurants, I referenced the issue of homelessness. This is a top concern in [GPE] in the abstract. We have [CARDINAL] unsheltered homeless individuals in [GPE]. We need to meet this moment aggressively, and I can assure you, I mentioned [CARDINAL] of our task force teams that are residing in this building, they are our teams just working 24/7 on this issue to get people out of encampments and get people into environments where we can address their growing anxiety and our growing concern about the health of some of our most vulnerable [NORP] out in the streets and sidewalks. We are in real time procuring hotels and motels to convert to appropriate sites. We have just identified as Just an example, this is not even close to the magnitude of what we are proposing, but it is just a point of consideration and a proof point to give you a sense of what we are doing. We have additional [CARDINAL] trailers that we have identified that will be dispersing to critical points across this state. We are working to address the needs within the shelters so that again we have appropriate distancing and we are appropriating ourselves as relates to social mixing for those vulnerable communities as well. So that is another area of deep and disproportionate emphasis that also we are advancing as a directive. As it relates to, again, vulnerable populations, you saw [DATE] we put out guidance as it relates to an executive order directing along the lines of what the [ORG] and others have been recommending. We codified that in [GPE] on visitation in our senior facilities, our skilled nursing facilities, our assisted living facilities. We now are tightening those directives to just end of life visitation, and that includes hospitals, not just congregate living facilities in the state. That is also a part of what we are advancing here [DATE]. So that gives you a sense of some of the current thinking of our healthcare professionals. Again, a number of them behind me. We have our finance team here and others in this building. We are gaming out the financial impacts, not just to the state's budget, but with disproportionate focus on families and individual budgets. This is a very different challenge, a very different crisis, and we need to meet this moment even different than we did in [DATE]. We have to really focus on individual, so looking at our unemployment insurance or disability insurance, looking at how we can compliment what was done at the federal level. We are also sharpening our focus on what we request of the federal government going forward as we believe the extraordinary work that has been done by Speaker [PERSON] and her colleagues, and we hope soon by [ORG] can be complimented with even more support that we think is necessary to meet this moment. In more parochial, for some more pedestrian issues related to our work with the [GPE] legislature, we are in real time conversations with the legislature about our current budget and how we will process the concerns and anxieties people have about business as usual and environment where business cannot be as usual and we will be making announcements on that in the next number of days, probably [TIME] of hours potentially, and certainly [DATE]. On the issue, finally, before I open it up to questions, of schools, I want to say this, current number of schools in [GPE] that have already shut down is [PERCENT] of all of the districts in the state. That is somewhat misleading number, [PERCENT], because [PERCENT] of these numbers are dynamic, and we will get you the real numbers. But we are in that range of [PERCENT] of all of our kids are no longer going to school starting [DATE] on the basis of [PERCENT] of the districts shutting down, meaning the largest districts in the state. [CARDINAL] out of [CARDINAL] of the largest districts in [GPE] have already shut down. The one remaining in that group is current high school district which has remained open. Many smaller districts remain open and for reasons that are perfectly understandable. This is something we also want folks to know. On [DATE], we will be putting out very detailed guidelines for those schools that remained open and continue to remain and are likely to remain open and those that have closed. We are vetting and curating and validating all kinds of private and public sector solutions to address the following and obvious real problems. How you feed people that cannot be fed otherwise because they are on free or reduced, not just lunch but also free or reduced breakfast. Some districts, [PERCENT], some districts even higher, of their children meet that criteria [PERCENT] throughout our entire educational system. It is [CARDINAL] thing to say you have a plan, it is another to actually deliver on that plan and with respect, not everybody that closed had that plan. So we are making sure we supplement that, take responsibility to meet that moment. That is transportation issue, that is a logistics issue, that is a siting issue, parks, libraries where we provide those supports. We also work with the private sector, and I must call out a Chef [PERSON] who was there at [FAC] and is here in this conversation working with his organization to provide nutritious meal alternatives as well and to help us with the logistics and the distribution of food sites throughout [GPE]. But we have particular concern, in addition to that, for special needs children, and this is something personal that I know all of us that have any empathy and capacity, as someone whose mother worked for [ORG], this is how I grew up with a deep consciousness and mindset for those with physical as well as cognitive disabilities. Many those children do not have places to go. We take for granted that so many of these kids are going to be taken care of, when in fact they are not going to be taken care of to the degree they should be, and so we are paying particular emphasis on those with special needs and making sure we meet this moment in the community childcare more broadly, defined, and we believe in quality childcare, not just access to childcare, what that really looks like. So that is what this planning process has been about. You may have noted [DATE] we initiated, right? Put some information out in the initiation of that planning process. On [DATE], we will lay out in detailed terms what that vetted and curated process and the protocols we want to establish look like from a very bottom up, not top down perspective, meaning districts and rural parts of the state operate very differently as it relates to community assets than some on the coast with large social safety nets. So we have to meet the needs of all of our diverse communities [inaudible [TIME]] in a nation state with [CARDINAL] children, and I should just note the first [CARDINAL] states that announced they were shutting down their education system combined did not even have as many children as we do in [GPE]. It gives you a sense of the magnitude of the number of children that we are needing to address, that again puts a real burden on trying to orient an appropriate response to meet this moment. The superintendent of public education, I have been working very collaborative with us, our health and human service agencies and our logistics teams that also are represented in those [CARDINAL] task forces that are included upstairs and in that total package in those numbers that I just referenced. So that is it on the schools, a little bit on our new advisories on bars and restaurants on social isolation home isolation for our [DATE] and older population and those with chronic disease. The fairly partnership that we are advancing, which we are very enthusiastic about and we hope is a model to this country, and then of course an update on the numbers of people that currently have tested positive. In closing, we anticipate as these tests significantly ramp up, the number of those by definition change the numerator, denominator, number of people will test positive. Again, we are just trying to break down how we prioritize those on the basis of need, seniors, homeless, and addressing the healthcare delivery systems capacity to meet the inevitable surge, and on that, I will just make this final statement. We have been in detailed negotiations and we will be bringing online, in [DATE], significant assets to help increase the surge capacity of our healthcare delivery system beyond the numbers I just laid out. We have already identified some very large hospitals that we can bring online that currently are not operational, and we could bring online in real time. We are in deep negotiations, and forgive me when you ask which specific sites are there, we are in deep negotiations to secure those sites. As soon as they are secured and the negotiations are complete, within the next number of days, we will announce those publicly. We are also looking on the basis of the work we are doing to triage the situation, not looking at the world in the aggregate but looking at the world as it exists within our diverse communities, meaning we may have a system that includes [CARDINAL] 000 hospital beds but not every community has adequate number of beds. So we are looking to site our focus and our energies to increase capacity in those communities that need it the most. So it is , yes, North and South, but it is also from a regional basis, looking at other parts of the state to the inland part of the state, not just in Coastal California. But we are very encouraged. I am in particular, and I think I can say this on behalf of [PERSON] [inaudible [DATE]] and others by the advanced negotiations on sizable assets that could be brought on line. [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL], in fact, I can say this. A minimum [CARDINAL] beds that will get up if these negotiations are successful just by [DATE] in world-class settings, and we have identified many other additional sites that we are also initiating conversations. I will conclude on that frame to also acknowledge philanthropy that is been incredibly supportive, some of the largest businesses as well, that are helping us identify those assets and are procuring resources in a resourceful mindset to help us with the formalized leases and potential purchases of some of these assets in real time to meet this moment.", "discourse_type": 0}

Can we hear it for [PERSON]? Where is he? Where did he go? What is up [PERSON]? He was so good. He is so good. He is the head of the [GPE] There you are. You just tore it up. [PERSON] is the head of [ORG], the co-chair. And I will tell you one of the things that I love about [PERSON], and he says it often. He understands his long life of service and dedication to public service, but he is always uplifting those who are the emerging leaders, and [PERSON] is one of them. So can we give it up for [PERSON], because that is what it is all about. That is what it is all about. It is about everybody taking on their role of leadership, knowing that we have so much at stake in this election. There is so much at stake. And so I came back to [GPE]. I love [GPE]. Last time I was here, it was before the pandemic. I spoke on the stage here at [GPE] in [DATE]. And come into [inaudible [TIME]] especially if you are black and hold elected office in [GPE], coming to [GPE] is like coming back to the womb. It really is. It is. Because [GPE] represents so much about who we are as [GPE]. [GPE] represents the hopes and the dreams and the fight to make real the promise of [GPE]. [GPE] is a place that has produced leaders who have been national leaders and international leaders. Who have always understood that hope will fuel the fight. Faith will be what grounds us in knowing what is possible. But then you got to just organize the folks, and bring people together, and recognize that nothing we have ever achieved as a nation by way of progress, came without a fight. And so that is what we have in front of us. We have for [DATE] [GPE], a fight for the soul of our nation. This is a fight that we are engaged in, because we believe in the ideals of our country. We believe in our democracy. We know that [GPE]'s democracy will always be as strong as we the people are in our willingness to fight for those ideals. And so that is where we are [DATE]. In a fight for the ideals, in a fight for the dignity, in a fight for justice and equal justice under law. And let us look at what is at stake. So we are dealing with a pandemic, and we are dealing with partly because of that, [CARDINAL] crises that are occurring at [CARDINAL] time in our nation. We are looking at because of the pandemic, a public health crisis. Where we have seen [CARDINAL] 000 [NORP] lose their lives in [DATE]. Many of whom tragically in [DATE] on earth, could not even be with their family, with people they love, because of the nature of this pandemic. We are looking at [CARDINAL] folks who have contracted the virus, thankfully have lived, but are looking at untold long-term consequences. Doctors are talking about things like lung scarring. And in the midst of this public health pandemic, we have [PERSON] who thanks to [PERSON], we know knew back on [DATE], he knew the deal about COVID. He had been informed that it can kill people, that it is [CARDINAL] times as likely to kill as the flu. He knew it was airborne. He knew it could harm children. And he sat on that information and he did not tell the [NORP] people. Can you imagine what you might've done had you known what he knew on [DATE]? How folks might've prepared? How folks might've said, I got to buy some extra toilet paper, at the very least. But also how the fact is that even in [PERSON] [GPE] before the pandemic, folks were working [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] jobs to try and pay the bills and pay the rent. [PERSON] I believe in our [GPE], nobody should have to work [CARDINAL] job to pay their bills and pay their rent and put food on the table. And he sat on this information. And then had the gall, had the nerve to say it was a hoax, to muzzle the public health experts. To suggest that he keeps a ledger, and you are on [CARDINAL] side of his ledger if you do not wear a mask, you are on another side of his ledger if you wear a mask. And now look where we are. Now look where we are. And he is in [ORG] where his boy [PERSON], trying to sue to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And let us step back for a moment and think about this. This man from the time he was Even before he was running for office when he questioned the legitimacy of the birthplace of the first black president of [GPE], has been so weirdly obsessed with trying to get rid of whatever [PERSON] created. Think about that. We do not need presidents who have weird obsessions. What is that about? So he is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which brought health coverage to [CARDINAL] [NORP]. Covered people with pre-existing conditions. You know anybody who has diabetes, high blood pressure, breast cancer, lupus. And he wants to get rid of the thing that brought care and dignity to [CARDINAL] of [NORP]. This is one of the reasons [PERSON] got to go. Got to go. We are in the middle of all these crises, the economic crisis. [CARDINAL] people in just [DATE] had to file for unemployment. We are looking at families that are getting up at [TIME], to drive to sit in their car in a food line for [TIME]. Praying that they can get to the end of the line before the food runs out. [CARDINAL] in [CARDINAL] mothers in [GPE] is describing her children [DATE] as being hungry. We are in the midst of a hunger crisis in [GPE]. And you see again, on the [CARDINAL] hand you have [PERSON] who says Let me tell you how I measure the economy and how well it is doing. I measure the greatnesses of the economy based on how working people are doing. How are working people doing? When working people and working families are doing well, then the economy is doing well. Which is why [PERSON] and I are saying, [CARDINAL], taxes will not be raised on anyone making [MONEY] 000 a year. We are saying that we know one of the greatest ways that we achieve access to economic health and intergenerational prosperity is home ownership. So we will have a [MONEY] [MONEY] tax credit for first time home buyers, to help you with down payments and closing costs to buy a home. We understand working families need childcare, but nobody should have to pay [PERCENT] 7% of their income in childcare. That is our commitment. Because we know the economy is doing well when working people are doing well. On the other hand you have [PERSON]. Who measures how well the economy is doing based on the stock market. Who measures how well the economy is doing based on how rich people are doing. Who as [CARDINAL] of his first orders of business, passed a tax bill benefiting [PERCENT] and the biggest corporations of [GPE]. I will tell you, [PERSON] and I will make it one of our highest priorities to get rid of that tax bill, and do what we know needs to be done to invest that money in working families. Public health crisis and economic crisis is being compared to the great depression. A long overdue reckoning on racial injustice in [GPE]. So on [CARDINAL] hand you have [PERSON], who has the knowledge and the courage enough to use the term and speak those words, black lives matter. On the other hand you have [PERSON], who refuses and will never say, Black lives matter. And then have the gall to stand on that debate stage at the last debate in front of [CARDINAL] [NORP], and would not condemn white supremacists. And people have asked me, they say, Well, [SPEAKER] By the way senator is not on my birth certificate. It is [SPEAKER]. And they say, Well, do you think Are you saying? Do you think he is a racist? Yes, yes. Because you see, it is not like it is some random one off. We have seen that pattern going back to him questioning the legitimacy of [PERSON], going back to [GPE]. When people were peacefully protesting racial injustice in [GPE], a woman was killed. And on the other side, you had a bunch of neo-Nazis wearing swastikas, carrying Tiki torches, slurring, throwing out anti-Semitic and racist slurs, and [PERSON] said, Well, there are fine people on both sides. A president of [GPE] who referred to [NORP] as rapists and criminals. A president of [GPE] who made as one of his first policy initiatives, a ban on [NORP] entering our country. And then stood on that stage and would not condemn known white supremacist, and then double down and said, Well, they should stand back and stand by. This is not reflective of who we believe we are as a nation. We need a president who acknowledges systemic racism, who acknowledges the history of [GPE], and uses that bully pulpit and that microphone, in a way that speaks truth with an intention to address the inequities and bring our country together. And that is [PERSON]. [CARDINAL] crises. Public health, economic, a grappling and a need to deal with racial injustice, and a climate crisis. So I come from [GPE]. I was born in [GPE], [GPE]. And we have some. You know. Okay. The West Coast has been burning because of those wildfires. [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE] have been battered by these storms. People in the Midwest, farmers have lost whole season of crops because of the floods. So [PERSON] says, We need to embrace science. We need to deal with it. This is something that is hurting people. It is something that we can address in a way we also create jobs by investing in infrastructure, investing in building renewable energy. That is going to be about jobs. [PERSON] knows the seriousness of environmental justice issues. He knows that of all of the areas where people live in [GPE] with poor air quality, [PERCENT] of the people in those areas are people of color. [PERSON] knows what is going on at [GPE]. [PERSON] says, We need to address this and we need to pay attention to science. On the other hand you have [PERSON], who recently when he was asked about the wildfires in [GPE] And the reporter said something like, Well, so the scientists are basically saying these fires, what is happening, the scientists are saying, 'there is a connection between this drastic changes in the climate and these wildfires.' You know what the president of [GPE] said in response? Science does not know. What! Science does not know the president of [GPE]. And what we see is a through line, right, on that issue and the first issue. An inability to embrace fact. An inability to embrace experts. An inability to embrace intelligence. An inability to be competent. An inability to do the job of Commander in Chief of [GPE], whose first responsibility is to concern themselves with the health and safety of the [NORP] people. And that is why we going to like [PERSON]. There is so much at stake. Now, you all know And [GPE] helped me when I ran for [ORG], and I am now the only black woman in [ORG]. Only the second in [GPE]'s history to be elected to [ORG]. And I am going to tell you because I have been there now for [DATE]. The [ORG] is so important on all these issues. We need to take back the white house, there is no question about that. We also need to take back the [ORG]. We need to take back the [ORG]. It is the senators that will make decisions about advise and consent on who sits in [ORG], right? One of the reasons I became a lawyer is because I was inspired by [PERSON] and [PERSON] and [PERSON], right? They are the ones who fought for [PERSON] v. Board of Education. They are the ones who have fought for civil rights. Who sits in [ORG] has everything to do with our fight for equality. Well, it is going to be the president who nominates somebody, but it is the [ORG] who advise and consent will make the decision about whether it goes through. And right now we are seeing that battle in full relief, with this illegitimate process they have engaged in to try and fill the seat of the great [PERSON], while people are voting in an election. The majority of [NORP] people say, Let us decide who will be our president, and then let that person decide who fills that seat? [ORG]. [ORG] is where there will be a decision on whether we put on the floor a bill that my brother [PERSON] from [GPE] and I wrote, called the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act. A bill that says like [PERSON] and I say, We should ban chokeholds and carotid holds, because [PERSON] would be alive [DATE] if that were the case. A bill that says, Let us have a national registry of police officers who break the law, because that is the right thing to do. And we cannot have folks just get fired [CARDINAL] place and then they will get hired somewhere else. It says, We need to have a national standard for excessive use of force. Because it is not right that in some places when there is excessive use of force the question asked is, Was it reasonable? When we all know you could not reason a way just about anything. And the more fair and just question to ask is, Was it necessary? We need to change the standard. Those kinds of decisions, yes they get made from [ORG], and we will make them. It also gets made in the [ORG]. And so that brings me to [PERSON] and [PERSON]. And [GPE] you got to send them to [ORG]. Send them to [ORG]. Let them represent [GPE] on all these issues. It is critically important. And you know those [ORG] seats, those are [CARDINAL] year terms. Think about your plans for your life and for your children's life, over the course of [DATE]. There is a lot that can get done, either for good or for not. These [ORG] seats are so important. So I am here, [GPE], [GPE], to ask you to do what I know you already know how to do so well. Which is to organize. Which is to talk to folks about what is at stake. Which is to remind people on the issue of voting. That we have got so many reasons. One has to do with again, [GPE], it has to do with [PERSON]. It has to do with those men and women who shed blood on [FAC] and so many other places, for our right to vote. And so voting is about honoring those ancestors. Honoring what they fought for and what they sacrificed for our right to vote. Voting is because there is so much at stake. Everything that we discussed. Everything that affects our lives. And voting also is because we are not going to let anyone mess with our right to vote. Because here is how I think about that. Step back and think about And I have been spending a lot of time all over. I have been to [GPE] [DATE]. I was in [GPE] [DATE]. I will be in [GPE] [DATE]. But think about it from this perspective. Ever since and even before they gutted the Voting Rights Act in [DATE], a whole lot of really powerful people including in this state, because otherwise we would be talking about Governor [PERSON]. A whole lot of powerful people for quite some time, have been trying to suppress our vote. Have been trying to purge the voter rolls. Have been trying to confuse us about the process, to make it difficult. Oh, you can fill out your ballot and then put it in [CARDINAL] envelope. But then you need to put it in another envelope and make sure that is signed. Trying to confuse us, trying to make it difficult. Messing with the post office. Can you imagine? The post office. Like the postman, the postwoman. They are messing with the post office. And we have to at some point sit back and think, Why are they trying to make it so difficult and confusing for us to vote? And I think the answer is because they know our power. They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. And so I am here to say [GPE], let us not let anybody take our power from us. We know the power of our voice. We know at election time the power of our voice is expressed through our vote. We are not going to let anybody take us out this game. We are present. We are powerful. We are active. And we know what is at stake and we honor our ancestors [DATE]. And so my last point is this, this moment will pass. And [DATE], our children, our grandchildren and others, they will look in our eyes each one of us, and they will ask us, Where were you at that time? And the thing we are going to be able to tell them, is so much more than just how we felt. What we will tell them is what we did. We will tell them, There was this [TIME] we were hanging out at [GPE] in the parking lot We will tell them we organized, that we talked to our neighbors and our friends and our relatives. We will tell them we helped people get to the polls. We will tell them [DATE] which is [DATE], that we made sure everyone we know, got to their County office to vote. We will tell them we stood up and we fought for our country, and we fought for the ideas because we love our country and we know our power. Thank you [GPE].", "discourse_type": 0}

[PERSON] told us a little bit of this story, but I really wanted to tell you why the work of the [ORG] matters so much to me. I grew up in a family in [GPE], and we were one of those paycheck-to-paycheck families, the kind just barely hanging on to our place in the middle class. When I was growing up, the path was very different for boys and for girls in [GPE]. Expectations were very different. Opportunities were very different. Back then, it was a world where most women stayed home. Little girls could do almost anything they wanted, so long as what they wanted to do was be mommies, nurses or teachers - and nothing else. I still remember, it was in second grade, when Mrs. [PERSON] told me that I could be a teacher, and, [PERSON] bless her, I said that is what I was going to do, and it changed my life. Now, all [CARDINAL] of my older brothers - I have [CARDINAL] much older brothers - I came along [DATE]. My mother always referred to me as the surprise. I was [DATE] before it hit me what that meant. I thought surprises were good things! That is a whole different story, but all [CARDINAL] of my older brothers went off to the military - they did not graduate from college - that was their chance to build a future, their ticket to the middle class. But if I wanted to teach, I needed a college diploma, and it is a long and complicated story, including getting married at [DATE] and dropping out of school - man, was I smart at [DATE]! But here is the key on that story. I grew up back when [GPE] was building more chances - not just first chances, but second chances. And for me, that second chance was a commuter college that cost $[MONEY] a semester. I understood what it meant to get a second chance-and you better believe, once I got it, I hung on for dear life. [DATE], I graduated. I can still remember [DATE] of school as a special needs teacher. The classroom all shined up and ready to go. There were cheerful pictures that I'd hung on the wall. The children were all ready for a new adventure. I loved that job. I truly loved that job. But by [DATE], I was pretty obviously pregnant. The principal did what I think a lot of principals did back then - he wished me good luck, and he did not ask me back for [DATE], and hired someone else for the job. I stayed home, and I tried desperately to be a good wife and mother, but I really wanted to do something more. So, I came up with a plan to go back to school, and this time I found a law school that was nearby. I cannot describe to you how crazy the idea was of my going to law school. My mother said many, many times, very loudly, that she thought I was jeopardizing my marriage. My brothers - [CARDINAL] of them - just thought I was plain nuts. My then husband smiled indulgently, making it clear that he knew that I could not possibly pull this off. But I bowed my head, I pushed on. You might say, nevertheless, I persisted. But I was determined, and so I took all the needed exams, I filled out the application; I budgeted and figured out how I could pay the $[MONEY] tuition. I worked out what the commute in my trusty blue [ORG] and I had it all figured - all of it - until I hit the [CARDINAL] big boulder that nearly crushed me: child care. My daughter [PERSON] was about to turn [DATE], and if I wanted to go to law school, I needed child care. And I know it sounds like I was not very smart, but I had not really realized exactly how hard that was gonna be. You know, I visited all kinds of places. I went everywhere - and I struck out everywhere. They cost a fortune or they smelled funny or the kids looked miserable. This went on for [DATE], and it is getting to be [DATE], and I am starting to sweat. We were bearing down on the start of school, and I knew that if I could not get childcare worked out, my idea of going back to school was over before it started. Finally, finally, [DATE] before classes were starting, I found a place that seemed nice. Cheerful teachers, a good playground, it smelled good. That thing matters, you know. There was [CARDINAL] problem: they only took children who were dependably potty trained. Man, I filled out that application, I said Sure. Dependably potty trained. Got it! We are so on this. And I left there knowing I had [DATE] to turn my not-quite-[DATE] into a ready-to-go, dependably potty-trained partner. And I just want to say that I am here [DATE] courtesy of [CARDINAL] bags of M&Ms and a cooperative [DATE] who loved chocolate. That is my story! I have got to say, going to law school and trying to raise a toddler was not always easy, but actually, it was a really special time. [PERSON] and I were buddies. We both had backpacks, and she allowed me to believe that a life that combined the inside and the outside - family and not family - could actually work. Now, we made it through [DATE] of law school and by the time I graduated from law school, I was hugely pregnant with Baby Number Two. By now, I was actually starting to think about career choices after law school, but law firms at this point were barely crossing the line to hire women, and hugely pregnant women were not on the recruitment list. Everyone smiled, no one said a word, and no one invited me back for a second interview. So, baby was born. I stayed home. Eventually, I got a job teaching at a law school, and when I got that job, I was beyond excited. I was back in the classroom. This time the kids were taller, and I did not decorate the classroom with pictures of animals, but I still loved it. I loved [TIME] of it. But what was going on in my life outside the classroom was not going so well. I had been teaching for [DATE] when the babysitter quit, and from then on, I was just on the treadmill. We cycled through [CARDINAL] child care arrangement after another and every transition sent me into a near-panic. Every time, it represented a failure. [TIME] after I'd put both the kids to bed, my [DATE] Aunt [PERSON] called long-distance from [GPE] to just see how I was doing. I said, Sure, I am fine. I am doing okay, I am fine. And in the middle of a sentence, I just started to cry. And once I started, I could not stop. I was failing. I was failing my kids, I was failing my family, I was failing my teaching. I was doing laundry at [TIME] and class preps after [TIME], and I felt like I was always behind. And then I said something that shocked me when I said it: I told Aunt [PERSON] I was going to quit my job. My beloved teaching job. It is like it just fell out of my mouth. Aunt [PERSON]'s waiting on the other end, long-distance, she waits for me to quit crying, waits for me to blow my nose and get a drink of water. Then she very matter-of-factly said, I cannot get there [DATE], but I can come on [DATE]. And she arrived with [CARDINAL] suitcases and a [NORP] named Buddy - and stayed for [DATE]. I am a [GPE] Senator [DATE] in part because my Aunt Bee rescued me on [DATE] [DATE]. Without child care, I was a goner. And I know how lucky I was, because so many working moms do not have an Aunt Bee with a dog named [PERSON] who can fly in and help out. Now lots of things have changed since [DATE] when I headed off to school, and a lot of things have changed since I started out as an assistant professor in law. There are a lot more women attending college, a lot more women in the workforce, a lot more women in corner offices and a lot more women in operating rooms. A lot more opportunities, and we celebrate those opportunities. But we also know that there are still plenty of obstacles facing working women, especially women with young children. And the challenge of finding reliable, affordable child care is a huge boulder firmly wedged between women and [CARDINAL] opportunities. Yup. It is a big obstacle. Take a look at the basics. [CARDINAL] of families, ordinary, hard-working families, simply do not have enough money to make it to [DATE]. I am not talking about enough money for fancy vacations or a new pair of sneakers. I am talking about families do not have enough money for housing and food and transportation. They do not have enough money to cover health care and education. And on top of all that, they do not have enough money for the child care they need so they can go to work and try to make some more money. Over [DATE], from [DATE], wages have effectively remained flat, while the costs of all kinds of basic expenses have gone up. Housing costs have risen by [PERCENT], health insurance expenses have doubled, college degree costs more than tripled, and those are all huge increases. But the cost of child care? It has gone up [PERCENT]. [PERCENT]. In [CARDINAL] of all states in [GPE], child care costs are higher than the cost of in-state public college tuition. That is a giant boulder that rolls across right in front of working women and families all across this country. And for single parents and for parents working near the bottom of the income scale, the cost of child care often stretches families' paychecks past the breaking point. Think about the consequences of these skyrocketing child care costs. [DATE], [CARDINAL] of mothers of small children have jobs. That is [CARDINAL] of mamas scrambling to make sure that someone is taking care of the baby while they head off to work. High child care costs limit career opportunities for those women, especially for single moms. They put economic pressures on families by making it tougher to save money for retirement or for a home. And they force families to make difficult compromises on the quality of the care that they can afford. There is a lot of research showing that high-quality early education helps kids succeed in school and helps them do better in life. It can be a powerful tool to close the achievement gap. But skyrocketing costs often mean that families have to settle for lower-quality care. For some parents, that tradeoff is really grim. Unlicensed care - a home where several children are parked in front of a television set [DATE]. A relative who really is not up to the task of keeping up with a [DATE]. Families do the best they can under difficult circumstances. Even if a family can pay, care often is not available. Try finding child care for a [DATE]. Or for a child with special needs. Or a place that is not [TIME] from home. Or a place that is open early enough that you can get you to your job by [TIME] or open late if you get caught in traffic or an emergency comes up, you know your kid is somewhere safe. [CARDINAL] of all [NORP] [DATE] live in a child care desert. And this disproportionately affects families of color and low-income families who have the most to gain if mom can get a decent job. The fact is that even as expectations and opportunities for women in the workforce have shifted in so many ways for the better, child care in [GPE] remains an enormous roadblock. Compared to the rest of the developed world, [GPE] significantly underinvests in child care programs. Preschool enrollment in [GPE] is much lower, and the average teacher to child ratio much higher. It is time for [GPE] to step up on this. [DATE] I joined with several of my [NORP] colleagues in [ORG] to support the Child Care for Working Families Act, this has been led by Senator [PERSON] from [GPE] and Congressman [PERSON] from [GPE]. This legislation would create a partnership between states and the federal government to ensure that no low-income or middle-class family pays too much of their income on child care, regardless of the number of children that they have. It is a step toward making child care and early education more affordable for working families who need it most, and I just want to shout out how much we appreciate the [ORG]'s support of this legislation. They are the ones giving it momentum and [ORG] should pass it now. Can we all just be clear on that? Go get 'em. And there is more we could do. You know me, I never come with just one ask. Consider scheduling. Think about this one for [TIME]. [CARDINAL] of all low-wage workers have little or no say over when they work, and [PERCENT] are in jobs where they can be called in to work extra hours at literally [TIME]. Just think of how much of a challenge it is to plan for anything, like doctor's visits, or going back to school, a second job - or, yes, child care -without even knowing when you will be working [DATE]. So, I have introduced the Schedules That Work Act in the [ORG], to put some basic fairness into scheduling. Congresswoman [PERSON] - the best - has introduced the legislation in the [ORG]. This is a bill that will help working families, and especially lower-wage and minimum wage workers. And again, [ORG] has been right there alongside me and alongside [PERSON] on this bill from the very beginning, and I am very grateful for that. We are going to get this done together, [PERSON]. We are going to do this. So that is [CARDINAL], but I have got to have [CARDINAL]. These are good steps, they are, but it is time to be bold. Think of it this way: [GPE] has agreed that every [DATE] should have access to a neighborhood school that will provide a safe place and be there [DATE] a week and will teach that child to read, and write, and add numbers, and take turns and not to hit their neighbors. We have got plenty of work to do to make sure that our public schools are providing real opportunities for all our children, but that is the basic goal. We have all agreed on the target. I believe that same kind of opportunity should be available to [DATE] and [DATE] and [DATE] and all our children - and all their families. It is a big goal, but no one builds a future without investment. Whether you and I have small children or not, we have an interest in the future of this country - and that means we have an interest, and a responsibility - to invest in [GPE]'s children. And that means making sure that their teachers and their caregivers are adequately paid and adequately trained. We do not climb up on someone else's backs. And it means making sure that when parents are working, their children are safe and loved and learning and growing. So, this is how I see it. Until we decide, until all of us decide - men and women, married and single, black and white, old and young - that we are willing to invest more in all our children, then we cannot build a country in which women have equal opportunity to build a future. That is how I see it. So that is why I wanted to be here [TIME]. I wanted to be here [TIME] because I believe in change, and I believe that the energy to make these changes will come from people like you, people who fight for equality [DATE]. And most importantly, the energy will come from the many people all across this country who have joined this fight and made it part of their lives. [DATE] after President [PERSON]'s inauguration - you all remember that day, right? Now I remember [DATE] of the inauguration, but I remember [DATE]. I went to [FAC] for the Women's March. Did anybody in here go to the Women's March? So I have got to tell you, in [GPE], we know how to do a Women's March. We had [CARDINAL] 000 people who showed up at [FAC]. In fact, our March was so big for the space available that the marching part of it consisted of clearing a little space in front of a few people so we could march a few steps, and then finally we all just gave up and hugged each other, and that was the end of it. But I wanted to tell you what it was like. It was an amazing moment. I look out and here is just this sea of people and women - many of them wearing pink pussy hats and waving handmade signs. And one of my favorites is, I saw a little girl riding on her daddy's shoulders, and she had this hand lettered sign, and I know she made it, and the reason I know is because it had a lot of glitter on it. Glitter and rainbows and horsies. And right in the middle, as she is waving it up on her daddy's shoulders, her sign said, I fight like a girl. I thought, me too, sweetie. That is where our army's coming from. And that is it. That is our army. And that is how we will fight for a level playing field for boys and girls, for men and women. And that is how we will win. So, to every one of you: Thank you for being part of this fight, we are going to win. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsdonaldtrumprallyspeechtranscriptnewtownpaoctober31", "text": "Thank you very much. Thank you. What an honor. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, thank you. We love this section of the world. It is a beautiful section. We appreciate it very much, and I am thrilled to be back in the great [GPE] of [GPE], so much. Thank you. This is the state where the story of [NORP] independence began. It is the state where the [NORP] constitution was signed. Think of that. And [DATE], this is the state that will save the [NORP] dream. On [DATE], we are going to win [GPE], and we are going to win [DATE] in that very beautiful [FAC]. We gather [DATE] in a very special place. In [DATE] of [DATE], when the [NORP] revolution seemed lost, General [PERSON] made his headquarters as this [GPE] farmhouse to plan his famous crossing of the Delaware. On [DATE], he led what remained, and just very little remained, of that rag tag continental army on a daring [TIME] raid. It was [TIME], it was [TIME]. They marched through [QUANTITY] of ice and snow, many without boots on their feet, leaving a trail of blood in their wake. At [TIME], they seized victory at [GPE]. Their sacrifice turned the entire tide of the war. Those soldiers came from every walk of life, but what united them all was their devotion to the principle of self-government. They were determined to live in a country where power belongs to the people. That priceless inheritance is at stake [DATE] from now, and a great red wave is forming. As sure as you are there, as sure as we are here together, and they see it. They see it at all sides, and there is not a thing they can do about it. This is the fundamental question facing every voter in [NORP]. Do you want to be a nation ruled by the corrupt political class, or do you want to be governed by the [NORP] people? I ran for office [DATE] because I could not sit by and watch any longer as a small group of [ORG] insiders continued to get rich bleeding [GPE] dry. They are just bleeding [GPE] dry. Think of it. Closing our factories, opening our borders, outsourcing our industries, and letting foreign countries ravage our middle class. Career politicians spend [MONEY] fighting foreign wars, while letting our own cities crumble and decay. Here in [GPE], you know this bitter and very painful betrayal all too well. Better than most. The corrupt [GPE] class launched an economic war against this state. For [DATE], they targeted your steel mills, shut down your plants, and sent [CARDINAL] of your jobs overseas, all while lining their pockets with special interest cash, and no one embodies this betrayal and treachery more than [PERSON]. And worst of all, the suppressed media and big tech refuses to cover the crime. They refuse to cover. We have learnt so much over [DATE]. For [DATE], he supported every disastrous trade deal that enriched his cronies and impoverished your state. He wiped out [ORG]. He was the cheerleader of NAFTA, and [GPE]'s entry into the [ORG] organization. [GPE] lost [PERCENT] of your manufacturing jobs after those [PERSON] disastrous. Then [PERSON] pushed the job killing Paris Climate Accord, an economic nightmare for [GPE] miners and every worker in our country. He backed TPP, which would have extinguished the [NORP] auto industry forever. Forever. These betrayals not only made [PERSON]'s donors rich, they made his family rich, and as we know, he profited from the misery of unleashed work and horror given to [GPE] workers. He made a lot of money, his family made a lot of money, and nobody knew about it until just recently. At the debate, I looked at him and said, [PERSON], you were here for [DATE], and you left [DATE]. Why did not you do these things that you want done? Why did not you fix it, [PERSON]? And as you know, because I assume a number of you watched the debate but as you know, he just looked at me and shrugged. In fact, the anchor looked up and said, Why did you do it? She could not believe it, and she was on his side. She said, Why did you do it? Why did you do it and why did you say it? In [DATE], [GPE] voted to fire this failed and corrupt political establishment, and you voted for an outsider's president who is finally putting [GPE] first. And if I do not look like a typical politician, that is very simple. It is because I am not a politician. If I do not always play by the rules of [GPE] and the [GPE] establishment, it is because I was elected to fight for you, and I fought harder for you than any president in the history of our country. From [DATE], [GPE] insiders have been trying to stop me because they do not own me and they do not control me. They want control. They do not like what I am doing. They do not like what I have said to the big pharma, the drug companies, the number [CARDINAL] lobbyist in the world, number [CARDINAL] lobbyist in our country. They did not like that I instituted Favored Nation so that we now pay the lowest prices in the world for prescription drugs, instead of the highest prices in the world. If these corrupt forces succeed in electing [PERSON], [ORG] will see to it that another outsider never becomes president again. It will never happen again, and nobody has done in [DATE], nobody, no administration, no president, what we have done and what we have accomplished, and it is not even challenged. Nobody even challenges that. They will take back control and they will never, ever give it up. This once in a lifetime opportunity to beat the corrupt politicians will be lost forever, and they know it. They are fighting so hard and they hate what they are seeing because they are not looking at fake suppression polls anymore. Now they are looking at the numbers that are pouring in, and they do not like the numbers that they are seeing in [GPE] and in [GPE] and in [GPE]. And we think in [GPE], although those numbers come in late. We think in [GPE]. They do not like it. They do not like it, they do not like what they see, and I just want to tell you that we have really, things have worked out so well for our country. Nobody had any idea that anything like this could ever happen. If you look at what is going on over [DATE], we have been building the biggest, strongest, and most secure middle class in human history. We built the most powerful military anywhere in the world. And over [DATE], we will make it even stronger. Stronger like nobody thought even possible. Do not be intimidated by our opponents' angry and menacing tone, because if we were, we would never have been able to accomplish what we have accomplished. In truth, they are actually terrified of you, the people. They are terrified. They are terrified that you will discover that you have the power to end their corrupt rule once and for all. We have to do it. When you see what is going on, we have to do it. We do not have a choice. Somebody said, Do you enjoy this? I said, It is not a question of enjoyment. Believe it or not I do. I should not . Have to go check something, but I should not . But you know, [DATE] we are doing [CARDINAL] rallies, [DATE] we are doing [CARDINAL], and the smallest crowd will be [CARDINAL] 000 people. Then on [DATE] we are doing [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL], and I cannot tell you what is going to happen there, but I think we will just go home and rest. But they do not get to decide this election. This is your choice. We have to be very careful. We have to be very, very careful, especially in this state, more than any other state. They say you have to be very, very careful. What happens in [GPE], we have to be extremely, everybody has to watch, vigilant. Your decision, your future is at stake. As your president, I do not answer to the special interests. I have no interest in it. I do not take instructions from donors and lobbyists. I do not care about them. I do not care about them. I do not take my orders from the media, or as I affectionately call them, the fake news media. And as you know, they have turned out to be far more fake than we ever thought, and they have really turned out to be corrupt. They are corrupt. They are really corrupt. The word fake is not strong enough, especially after what we have seen where stories, major stories, the biggest story anywhere in the world, is absolutely not covered. It is hard to have scandal when you have no coverage, and they work in conjunction with big tech, and they protect each other, and they protect the [NORP], because with the [NORP], you do not have somebody up talking like I do about them, so they can do whatever they want, and this will only lead to very bad things. I do what is right for [GPE]. I do what is right for [GPE]. It is made me a lot of enemies in [GPE] but I wear their opposition as a badge of honor. [PERSON] once said that it was a nation that had the lion heart. I had the luck to give it the roar. I gave it the roar, and there is a roar, and people hear it all over. They heard it [DATE] loud and clear. Probably the biggest thing to happen. They talk Brexit, they talk many numerous things, but this is always number [CARDINAL]. What happened, [DATE]? And I will say, [DATE] was an incredible earth shaking event, but [DATE], and I never thought I'd say this, [DATE], what we are doing right now through [DATE], what we are doing is far bigger. It is far bigger. I never thought I'd say it. I never thought [DATE], and you never did either, somebody would say that this is going to be the most important election perhaps in the history of our country. It is really amazing. The greatest threat to [NORP] democracy is the concentration of power among a small group of unelected special interests. The big tech CEOs who have been put in a position by us giving a law to them, Section 230. We have given them that power, and you know that can be taken away. That can be taken away, and probably has to be taken away. I see it better than all. I see it so obviously. I see it because of what I do on social media. For me, it is very easy to see. I see things that nobody would believe. The corporate media and the mega donors in [GPE] and Silicon Valley, they are all lining up behind an opponent that is going to do whatever they tell him to do. That sleepy [PERSON]. He could've been the greatest. You know, if you look, we look at the amount of money that he has raised. [MONEY]. [MONEY] [DATE]. But I could've been the greatest of all time. I could've been the greatest political fundraiser, because as president all I had to do was call Wall Street, the big banks. I could've called the oil companies, I could've called all of the big companies. Every single one of them, and I know many of them would've given me whatever I wanted, but I chose not to do that, and we did plenty. We have plenty. You can only buy so many commercials. When the air waves are full and you cannot buy anymore, I say, Where are we going to spend it? Although we did spend in our case a lot on ground game, which they, I think, forgot this part. As much money as they have, they are screaming in [GPE], Where is our ground game? Where is our ground ? Well, it takes a long time. You know what? It took us [DATE] to build that ground game, so we will see how it all works out, but they did not do that. They decided to go a different route, but they took in massive amounts of money. I could've taken in much more than that. They did [CARDINAL]. I could've done that within [TIME]. The president is calling. He'd like you to send [MONEY], please. Who is going to tell me no? Nobody. But the problem is, the problem is when they call in [DATE] needing a favor that is worth [CARDINAL], it is very hard, especially me being a loyal person, not a dishonest person, but a loyal person, it is very hard for me to say, No, I do not want to take his call, his or her call, no, I do not want to do it. Really, you are compromised. It would've compromised our nation, so I did not want to do that. [PERSON] works for them. I know them very well. I know them far better than he does. I know him far better than he. Some are friends. Some are actually very surprised when I say, You do not have to bother, do not worry. I do not think we can buy anymore anyway, right? But he works for them, and when you see those numbers, [CARDINAL], so much they do not know what to do with it, where they are spending [MONEY] on a congressional race that used to spend [MONEY], you know something's going on, and it is not a good thing, and it is not the way I want to work. This was [CARDINAL] opportunity to do something special. This is not a company, this is not making some money. This is [CARDINAL] opportunity to turn our country around, and we are not going to blow it. He works for them. Not for you, and it is I who work for you. I am working for you. It is like, not used to that, too much, but I have gotten used to it, and we have this great opportunity together, and our people tend to vote, in particular this state, you tend to vote on [DATE]. I could say, Go in and early vote, do not wait til [DATE], vote [DATE], vote [DATE], vote on [DATE]. But I am wasting a lot of time, because you want to go. It is tradition, it is habit. It is the history of this state. Look at what you have done with this state. Look at the history of this state with respect to our country, and you want to go, I will not even say go [DATE], go [DATE], go [DATE], or go on [DATE]. We want [DATE]. Thank you. [DATE]. And we have others like that, too. We have others like that, too. They want [DATE]. It is going to be [DATE]. The more these corrupt forces oppose me the more I know we are delivering real change, real progress, and historic victories for the [NORP] people. We have done great things with the country including our military, our vets. The biggest tax and regulation cuts in history. We just received a poll, this was a real poll, not a suppression poll, where the vets gave us a [PERCENT] approval rating for the job that we are doing. Think of that. [PERCENT]. The highest ever. Over [DATE], we have been building the strongest and most secure middle class in- we have been building the strongest and most secure middle class in human history. We have built the most powerful military in the world by far. Nobody has ever built what we have built. And when I came in, we had a depleted military. We had old planes. We used to get parts by going to the airplane graveyards and taking the old parts out of old planes that were sitting there rusting of the sun. And crazy weather where they store them in the deserts. And that is what we were doing. We had a depleted, a terribly depleted military. And now we have the best equipment anywhere in the world by far, all made in the [GPE] And as I say, we are the envy of every world, we are the envy of every world power, from [GPE] to [GPE], [GPE]. They look at us and they say, Wow, what they have done? New jets, new fighter jets, bombers, tanks, missiles, rockets, nuclear. And just hope to God that we never have to use it. Hope to God we never have to use it. But it is less likely that we will ever have to use it when we have it. Okay, when we have it. We were in very bad shape militarily, a general came to see me, highly overrated general came to see me actually, [CARDINAL] of the world's most overrated generals. And he said, Sir, we have no ammunition. Right at the beginning, you know what I am talking about because we could have had conflict. He said, Sir, could you hold it off? We have no ammunition. And I said, General, no president should ever hear that statement again. We have no ammunition. Well, now we have so much ammunition. Our problem is, we have no storage. And over [DATE], we will make it even stronger, going to keep us safe. [TIME], our brave special forces rescued at [NORP] hostage in a far away country. They are incredible people. And I was in [GPE] [DATE] and I met a lot of the incredible, these incredible, talented, strong, both physically and mentally, the strongest, the best in the world. But we had a mission sent to a far away land where they kidnapped an [NORP] citizen. And the kidnappers wished they had never done it. And they went in with a large group, [CARDINAL] casualties. We got our [NORP] citizen, young man, we got our young man back. But the other side suffered gravely, I can tell you that. Our nation salutes its courageous military, which brilliantly executed this operation. Very few people would have been able to do it. It was very complicated and a very complex, tough area. We celebrate the safe return home of an [NORP] hostage. We have got many hostages home. And I pay nothing, nothing, cannot pay. Once you pay, you will have many, many more. We are [DATE] [inaudible [TIME]] [PERSON] who is doing a tremendous job said to me, Sir, you are [DATE] and [DATE] and O, think of that, we have brought many, many of them home. Some mostly in pretty good shape, some in very, very, bad shape. Specifically, you know who I am talking about. Came home in very bad shape. But sometimes that happens too. But we have brought many home, but we do not pay. You pay, once you pay, your numbers will go up a thousand fold. We are boldly standing up to [GPE]. We achieved the most secure border in [NORP] history, our Southern border. We have obtained in just a short period of time, [NORP] energy independence. And if it were up to the opposing side, with [ORG], [ORG]. [ORG] plus three and you add [PERSON] and [PERSON], and you add [PERSON], who really does not understand so [inaudible [TIME]]. They will tell him what to do and he will do whatever they tell them, whatever it takes, he will say whatever it takes. With the sunglass-, I saw the sunglasses. I said, I do not think I am going to do that. But I watched those sunglasses. I do not know, to me it did not work. We are bringing our jobs, our factories, our wealth, and our troops all back home. They are all coming home. They are all coming home. And instead of endless wars in countries that even you very sophisticated people in some cases have never even heard of, we are achieving [CARDINAL] historic peace after another, if you look. Middle East, we already have [CARDINAL] signed up. We have many countries who want to sign, we are signing them rapidly. And even with [GPE] and [GPE], we are doing a trade deal with each, a routine trade deal. When I heard about it, I said, Wait [TIME], they have been killing for [DATE]. They have been killing and killing for [DATE] each other, fighting all the time. We are doing a trade deal, they want it. They always want us, all of them want us, the whole world wants us. So we are in a great negotiating position. But I said, [GPE], [GPE], we are doing a trade deal. You tell them we are not going to do the deal unless they make peace. Then all of a sudden they were hugging in [FAC]. Great, right? And it came through common sense and it came for no money, could not make a trade deal. We said, no, we are not going to make the deal unless you [CARDINAL] start getting you are killing each other for [DATE] and [DATE], that is all they do is they kill each other. And when I saw the [CARDINAL] leaders hugging in [FAC] and I mean, I think they were exhausted, frankly. I think it was time, it was time, but somebody had to say do it, just seemed to make a lot of sense. I said, Wait [TIME], let us do it. And we did it, so I am very happy about that. And thanks to our administration's unprecedented mobilization. We are now [DATE] away from a mass distributing of a safe vaccine. We have got it, we have get great companies, [ORG], [ORG], [ORG], all with a vaccine. All with a different, little different versions of it, some similar, some similar concepts. And many other companies and we are ready, we will have that, and we will have it. But even if you did not , and I say, it drives them crazy. We are rounding the turn, we are rounding that turn, we are rounding it. And our economy went down less than any economy anywhere in the world. And it went up faster by far. They keep hearing about Europe, Europe, Europe, well, they are not doing nearly as well. Seniors will be first in line for the vaccine. And the vaccine will be free because it is not their fault. It was [GPE]'s fault. [GPE] did this to us. And our vaccine will eradicate the virus and end the pandemic once and for all. [NORP] will return to school and to life. By slashing red tape and cutting bureaucracy, we are producing this vaccine in record time. If [PERSON] were president, you would not have this vaccine for [DATE]. And he had his chance with the H1N1, he calls it in reverse, swine flu, which was a disaster. We have moved heaven and earth to produce the vaccine ahead of schedule and manufacture [CARDINAL] of doses in advance, all ready to be shipped. And we have our military is going to be shipping it. Logistics, we have a general, that is what he does. He delivers troops. He said, Sir, this is easy. We will get it done very quickly. It is the most advanced medical operation anywhere in the world and in history. Thanks to the therapies we have accelerated, we have already reduced the mortality rate. [PERCENT], think of the that, down [PERCENT]. And our excess mortality rate is [PERCENT] lower than Europe's. And Europe has done a good job, it is a very brutal thing. Everyone thought [GPE] was doing great, great, great, great, they are not doing great. Right now you see what is going on over there with [GPE], again, [GPE] and [GPE]. But we are doing great, but we just do not get credit for it. We do not get credit. And I do not want the credit personally, but I want the generals and the admirals, and our great Vice President [PERSON], who worked so hard. All of the people on the task force and [PERSON], what he did, he is here someplace. But he was fantastic on the ventilators. Ventilators are very, very complex. Oh, look at that, [PERSON], and he wants no praise, he could not care less. He truly could not care. Thank you, [PERSON]. No, we had a tremendous just a quick story, we had a tremendous ventilator problem because we were not equipped for a thing like this. This is once in [DATE], [DATE], we are talking about, the Spanish Flu. And we were not equipped for that. And all of a sudden we are getting calls. We need [CARDINAL] ventilators. Like in [GPE], they needed far less than that, but they needed many, many ventilators. And other states are calling, we need ventilators. And it is a very complicated piece of equipment, as you can imagine with pipes going down, heavily computerized. And people did not know what to do, making them on a mass scale like this, hospitals had very few of them. And [PERSON] called up some of his genius friends, his brother is one of the most important people in Silicon Valley, smart family. They called up and they had these super brilliant young men come in. I mean, some of them were wearing undershirts, they were wearing a [inaudible 00:33:26]. They are wearing a baseball cap. How much are you worth? [MONEY], sir. They had founded companies, sold their companies, but they were brilliant. [CARDINAL] of them had roller skates on and they wanted to throw him out of [FAC]. They said, Sir, there is a kid here, undershirt and rollerskates. I said, Yeah, he is worth [MONEY]. But [PERSON] called a whole group of people down. And to them, to us, to all of us, a ventilator is very complicated. To them it is like the simplest machine they have ever seen. And they went to the automobile companies where they had excess plant capacity. And they went to various companies. And we started producing within a short period of time, ventilators. And this story is just never told, and I do not think I have ever told it, not in this detail. We started producing ventilators in a short period of time at a level that nobody thought was [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] nobody thought was even possible. And in a relatively short period of time, after that, all of our hospitals were sent [CARDINAL] of ventilators, [CARDINAL] of ventilators. Great companies, very big companies, the car companies, very big companies. They did a fantastic job. They'd line up with a small ventilator company, and we make the best ventilators, I mean, they say they are the best. And they were sent all over our country. And think of it, and that was done so quickly. But these brilliant young people were able to do it. Regular people could I mean, you could never do a thing like this. So we made [CARDINAL] a month and not [CARDINAL] person, think of this, in our country, not [CARDINAL] person who needed a ventilator did not get a ventilator, how incredible is that? But they will not tell that story. That is not me, that is [PERSON] and a whole group of very brilliant people, together with the military and with a lot of great companies. We have had a tremendous relationship. It is the biggest mobilization since World War II. And it was an incredible job. Now what we are doing is we are making we continue to make [CARDINAL] a month and we are sending them to foreign countries who were desperate for ventilators. And would have no idea, there would be no way they could ever get them. Including, I mean, we sent them to [GPE] and we sent them to [GPE], and [GPE], but we send them to countries in Africa, who are really having a terrible hard time. And we are sending [CARDINAL] of them to other countries. And I just think it is a tremendous story. And it is something that we did that we are very proud of. And I did something that nobody talks about. You do not hear about you do not hear the word ventilators anymore. You know why you do not hear about it because we solved There was a period of time, ventilators, for [DATE] five weeks until they sent these super geniuses in. For [DATE] five weeks, all you have heard about was ventilators, ventilators, ventilators. Well, we took over something, the cupboards were bare. They were bare, or essentially bare, but they were bare. And the hospitals in the states, the cupboards were bare too. Nobody was prepared for a thing like this. That could have been, they should have been. But now all over the world we are sending them and I think it is just a tremendous story, I really do. It is a story that is untold, you will probably never hear that again. And as soon as we started making all of these [CARDINAL] of ventilators, you have not heard the word ventilator just like and there is [CARDINAL] other quick story. The wall, the wall, the wall, that is all you heard. [SPEAKER] promised the wall, will he ever give the wall? The wall, the wall. And then now the wall is going to be completed very quickly. We have [QUANTITY] of wall built. And now you never hear the word wall. They never say, Oh, he got the wall, he did it. And we built it exactly to the specifications of the border patrol. And they were tough specs, I will tell you. I said, How about concrete plank? No, sir, we need steel, we need rebar and we also need concrete. Oh, that is great. But we got it built and they have to have vision. They have to have slats because they have to be able to see through what is on the other side. You cannot have once you realize this, I mean, they are right. So we built it to those specs. Very, very they have done an incredible job. We are doing [QUANTITY] a week. We will be finished very soon. But you never hear about the wall anymore. Now if it was a failure, if we could not get it done, it would be brutal. It would be a brutal time for your president. Because of our relentless efforts, the recovery rate right now on COVID or the [GPE] virus or the [GPE] plague is [PERCENT], think of that, [PERCENT]. And I am here, I am here, right? I am here. And these [CARDINAL] great people whose property we are using [DATE], what a historic property. And all I know is they said we just drove up the road, they have been here a long time, but not as long as [PERSON], right, but they have been here a long time. And they said, and you have probably many of you said, do you see the crowds along It looks at [FAC], except a slightly more picturesque, slightly more picturesque. But it is [CARDINAL] of people lined all the way down to the highways, it is incredible, and they are all waving flags. Most importantly, they are all waving flags and they are proud of our nation. And I guess it has something to do with [GPE]. I am going to be here [DATE] [DATE]. But no, it is a beautiful site and they were very proud, and thank you very much for everything you have done. We are allowing younger, healthier [NORP] to resume normal activities while strongly protecting the elderly and those at high risk. And we are making the powerful antibody treatment that I received available to anybody that needs it, free, free. Wasn't their fault. But I had that and I did not feel good. I said, What is going on? And test positive, and I am the President of [GPE], I could not bury myself in a basement of [ORG] as nice as it is. I actually got to see it one time, it is very nice. Like you would expect, it is a beautiful basement, it is in [FAC]. It is a very solid basement. But I could not do that. And I could not put myself in a beautiful room upstairs, beautiful bedroom, and stay there for [DATE]. I am the President. And I go to meetings, I'd say That is a lot of people. And then one day that happens. And I said I was not feeling good. And the doctor came in and great doctors, great [ORG] doctors, [PERSON]. They came in and they said, Sir, you have tested positive. I said, Tested positive for what? And they said, For COVID, for COVID. He actually used the term COVID, he is more politically correct than I am. I said, That is not good. But I did not feel good and we went over to [ORG], which is phenomenal. I see the work they are doing, young men coming back so badly, and women, so badly wounded. I see what they can do, what they can do and nobody can do what they can do. And [ORG] was great. We had a lot of doctors gathered around. But I did not feel good and they gave me something, [ORG], and [ORG] makes a very similar kind of a thing. The concept is based on antibodies. And I woke up [TIME] and I felt so great, I wanted to rip that [PERSON] shirt open. I wanted to come back. I wanted to start doing a new trade deal and campaigning simultaneously. They said, Sir, how about taking it easy for [DATE]? But no, it is incredible. What we have been able to do is and I do not even know. Maybe now I am saying, well, it probably was not the drug, it is just that I am in such perfect physical condition. And I am very young, if you are young, so I said that. And [ORG] got very upset [inaudible [TIME]]. Their camera just went off, the light. They got upset. They said, He is not young and he is not in perfect shape. I said, I am a great physical specimen. They did not like it when I said that. They do not like those kind of things. No, but I do not know, maybe I helped, I do not know. But I can tell you it is incredible what they have been able to do. And I think it did help a lot, frankly, because I got out of there fast. I could have gotten out a lot sooner too. I wanted to go out almost immediately. They said, Nice and easy, please, sir. But shows you, maybe I serve as an example, First Lady got it also and she is better. She is perfect. And [PERSON], right? [PERSON], [PERSON] got it. My young boy, he is [DATE], my young, tall boy, I say, he is very tall. He is a good guy, good-looking guy and strong. So he has it. They say, Sir, [PERSON] tested positive also. I said, Wow. Then I go, this was at the beginning, I go, I say to the doctor, like [TIME], Doctor, how is [PERSON] doing? Oh, he is okay, sir, he sloughed it off. You know why, they are young and their immune system works. That is why I say, get back to school, get back to school. Get back to school, open up this state, Governor, open up this state. And do not take advantage of those ballots, Governor, do not do it, do not do it. We will terminate the virus with science, medicine and- We will terminate the virus with science, medicine, and groundbreaking therapies and cures. I watched [PERSON] speak [DATE]. All he does is talk about COVID, COVID. He is got nothing else to say, COVID, COVID, COVID. We agree. It is serious and we have done an incredible job. And at some point, they are going to recognize that. I said we have done an A+ job, but I give ourselves a D or maybe an F in terms of public relations, but now I will start talking about it a little bit. When [PERSON] was Vice President, his failed approach on the swine flu was, as I said, a total disaster and his chief of staff said that he had no idea what he was doing. I do not know why this guy said this. And now, they are thinking about bringing him into the administration. I guess, probably this is maybe before the flu came along or something because I am saying, Why would he say this? He goes, quote, We did every possible thing wrong and [CARDINAL] [NORP] got H1N1, far less lethal, by the way, far less lethal. And in that period of time, and it is just purely fortuitous that this is not one of the great mass casualty events in [NORP] history. This is [PERSON]'s chief of staff. Think of what he said. Where did this guy come? You are going to bring him back? It had nothing to do with anything we did. We did not do anything right. Now, think of this. And then he is saying, We want to take over what you are doing. Right? He says, We want to take over. Remember he said, when he first started running, that I did a poor job because I did not act fast enough. I acted in [DATE]. We had almost no deaths. Think of this. And I said, [GPE] is heavily infected. They cannot come in. And I went up against Dr. [PERSON] and others that said, No, no. You should not do this. You should not do it. I said, Listen, they are infected, heavily infected. Let us close off [GPE]. So I did that. I closed off Europe. I did that and, [PERSON] will tell you, saved [CARDINAL] of lives. Much more than that. And then when you think, okay, we saved [CARDINAL] and thousands of lives and then [PERSON] is campaigning. And he was [DATE], he said, We have to get tough, and he called me xenophobic because I closed. [DATE], then he runs and he said, He should've closed the country earlier. I said, I do not think he is going to get away with that. And let us see what happens on [DATE] because, if something happens that is wrong where he did, then he did get away with that. Now, here is a guy, not the smartest guy out there and he never was, but now in particular he is not doing so well, but here is somebody that says that I did not act early enough and, for [DATE], he was scolding everybody saying that they should not have closed off [GPE], they should not have done and that nothing bad is going to happen. But remember the statement from his That was his chief of staff made that statement. We mourn for every life lost to the [GPE] virus and in their memory and their sacred memory. We truly do. We mourn. It should've never happened. We will defeat the virus and emerge stronger and more unified than ever before. That is all we can say. We are going to be more unified than ever before. Our economy is now surging back faster, better, bigger, and stronger than any nation on earth. We just had [DATE] of economic growth ever recorded, by [CARDINAL]. A [PERCENT] increase, more than our great number from [DATE]. That was the number we [inaudible [TIME]] but more than double. And you know what? The press is refusing to talk about it. It is not even a major story. [CARDINAL] of the analysts said [DATE] it was the greatest economic number that they have ever seen. GDP up [PERCENT]. That means it grew [CARDINAL] in [DATE]. And the press barely mentions it, not even on the front page of newspapers because that is the game they play. It is suppression. That is why we have to win. We cannot let them do this. We have to win. This was according to a certain very important person, [PERSON], who is a terrific guy and other people. Sir, this is the greatest financial number probably ever recorded in our country. Think of that. That is a big statement. And double, more than double a number from [DATE] and it is barely covered. And that is only for one reason; because they want us to do very poorly on [DATE]. They do not want to tell the [NORP] public about this. The [CARDINAL] advantage I do have is I do have a way of getting the word out, but it is very tough when they pick it up. Even this, they will not pick this up. I made a statement, strong statement. They will not pick it up because it is good news. They will fabricate stories. They will make up false stories. They will put you number one on Twitter all the time, stories that are not trending. These stories are so boring. They will make up The [ORG] will write false stories all the time, and yet they will not talk about the [PERSON] corruption. They will not talk about where is [PERSON] and they will not talk about Do not feel bad. The cameras are all off. Do not worry. We just lost the last camera. I am sorry. But they will not talk about the fact that [PERSON] got $[MONEY], [MONEY] a month to sit on a board of [ORG] and got [MONEY] up front, who had no job, who had no experience in energy. They will not talk about the fact that the wife of the Mayor of [GPE] gave him [MONEY]. For what? They will not talk about the fact that the father went to [GPE] and [ORG] to where is [PERSON]? Where is [inaudible 00:50:24]? I put his first name, his real first name is Where. We are going to make it Where. Where is [PERSON] was with him. And in [TIME], he walked out with [MONEY] to manage, which is [MONEY] in fees, [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL]. And they will not talk about the fact that he was going for the big one next when [GPE] asked for [MONEY] a year for introductory purpose. In other words, he was going to introduce people [MONEY] a year. This is a payoff. That is all it is. And they will not talk about the fact that the father was the big guy. To me, he is not a big guy. Little guy. He is very slight. Remember when he said [DATE], he said, I'd like to take him to the back of the barn? I went like this. I will take him to the back of the barn. The glasses. [DATE] will be [DATE] in the history of our country, if we do not raise taxes. If [PERSON] is elected, he will delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, close down schools and impose a nationwide lockdown. That is what they are talking Can you imagine going And we are making the greatest comeback of any country by far and they are actually talking He is talking about a lockdown. He has no clue, but he is talking about it. That is his only plan, to make you a prisoner in your home, a prisoner in your own country and, under the [PERSON] lockdown, the recovery will be totally killed. The economy will crash. The country cannot afford it. The people cannot afford it, but country cannot . Can you imagine? I mean, your state has to open up, too. All [NORP] governors, you, [GPE], [GPE], they are all [NORP] governors and they are probably doing it because they want to affect the election. They are probably doing it, by [DATE], they will announce, We have decided to open up [GPE]. [GPE] will be opened on [DATE]. No, because they cannot be so stupid, what they are doing to people. And the countless people that will die from depression and drug overdoses and suicide and abuse and, really, a deferral of medical care. There'll be no school. There'll be no graduations. There'll be no weddings, no Thanksgivings, no [DATE], no Easters, no [DATE]. There'll be nothing. We will be nothing. And [CARDINAL] thing we have learned very recently, everyone likes the computers and the laptop and, oh, we can learn from the computer. You do not have to go. Well, now we have given it the all-time mass test. A child being in a classroom or, if you are older, a campus, even a college campus, but a child being in a classroom cannot be replaced by a computer. It cannot . It does not work. It is no good. And they are losing potentially [DATE] out of their life and it is [DATE]. It is [DATE], but the computers do not work. They are okay, but they are a small percentage and that is come out loud and clear. Telehealth, great. It is been incredible. I think it is a [PERCENT] increase and telehealth has been really great. It is going to have a great future, but not education. They have to be in their classroom with other students and they have to find their way in life. And this is no future for what they are doing in [GPE], what they are doing in other states. This is no future for [NORP] youth. It is going to have a longterm impact on them. [PERSON]'s plan will destroy [GPE]. My plan will destroy the virus and make [GPE] greater than it is ever been. And the skyrocketing cases in Europe have shown Draconian lockdowns, and that is what they are, they are [NORP], do not stop the virus. They have done it. [GPE] was so locked down now. It is starting all over again. They just do not . It is a terrible thing that was unleashed on us and we should never forget what happened. We should never, ever forget that [GPE] could've stopped it. They stopped it from going into the rest of [GPE], but not from going to Europe, [GPE], and the rest of the world. We can never forget it, but the far left is determined to lock down [GPE] because what they crave more than anything else is power and control over you. [PERSON] has made a corrupt bargain. In exchange for his party's nomination, he has surrendered his party to the radical socialist left-wing extremists, anarchists, looters. [DATE]'s left tolerates no challenge and allows no descent. You see that. They have them locked down. That is the ultimate lockdown. You can do horrible things or you can do nothing wrong and they will put in stories. I am actually a victim of the opposite. I am just thinking about when I am talking to you. They do phony stories that are totally false and they will put them up and there is nothing you can do. There is nothing you can do except explain it away. If you disagree with them, they try to humiliate you, smear you, and cancel you, cancel culture. Right? They control [PERSON], and he is so easy to control, just like they control every [NORP] house member and every senator. They purge newsrooms of reporters who do not swear allegiance to their false narratives. You have seen some reporters are extremely upset. They end up getting absolutely decimated. They censor stories that reveal the corruption of their chosen candidate. This is what is happened now and nobody's ever seen anything like it. Everybody knows that it is It is incredible. Nobody's seen anything like it. You do not read anything. You go to the [ORG], there is no story in it. You go to [ORG], you go to [ORG], you go to [ORG], the worst of all in my opinion, [ORG]. The home of the Apprentice. Made them a lot of money over [DATE], but they were bad. They were very bad. [ORG] has been terrible. [ORG] is just absolutely ridiculous. Thank goodness they have lousy ratings. Thank goodness. And I call it [ORG]. What they do is just absolutely It is not even thinkable. It is not even to be believed. They totally close it down and you cannot have scandal when nobody's reporting about it. And the level of power is pretty incredible. And I heard this [DATE], Sir, you cannot compete with big tech. You cannot compete. The networks were against us. It was the same group. And then I won. I said, See, they are not very powerful? But you know what? They are. And now they are at a level that nobody's ever seen before and they are blatant about it. Now they just say, We are doing it. [ORG], they apologized to their subscribers because they were losing, after the last election, [CARDINAL] of subscribers and they wrote a letter of apology. I could not believe it. And they really got good for [DATE] and then they got worse than ever. I mean, it is [DATE], a phony story, after story, after story. They have a story about taxes. I do not pay taxes. And I just call my people, What [inaudible [TIME]]? Oh, no. You have paid [MONEY], sir, but you prepay your taxes. Oh. Well, why are not they mentioning it? I prepaid [MONEY] of tax. I prepaid. That is worse than paying taxes. I am prepaying. I say, Why do we prepay so much? Because these are estimates when you are negotiating taxes. These are estimates. You are prepaying estimates. How much? [MONEY], [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL], but they do not do that. We call them, we tell them and they say, Well, that is prepaying. Well, prepaid is worse than right? I mean, how good is that? We are prepaying, but they do not put that in the story. These are very corrupt, very dishonest people. They tell you that writers are peaceful protestors because you are not allowed to have I had it [DATE] in [GPE] where we were going to have [CARDINAL], 000 people. And the Governor of [GPE], radical left [NORP] and the Attorney General, they said, No, the most you can have is [CARDINAL] people. To my people they said that. And so my people said, So we are going to close it down. We had [CARDINAL] of people. I do not know. You probably all saw it [TIME]. We had [CARDINAL]. We were going to have [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] 000 people. And do not forget, they have done a terrible job in [GPE] where they let [GPE] burn down. And they could've called us a lot sooner. We went in. Took us [TIME] what, [TIME] to solve the problem? No, we could've gone in there. We were willing. We called them. We were willing to go there immediately instead of having everybody running away. And they have a very good police or they had a very good police force, but they do not let them do what they have to do. And they shut it down. They said, No, you cannot have [CARDINAL], but you can have [CARDINAL] people. And I said to my people, No, let us go. Let us speak in front of the [CARDINAL]. What I did not know is that [CARDINAL] of people were going, anyway. They just went. And I think that, had I done a regular rally with because we are getting [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], 000 people. We are getting much more than that in some. Nobody's ever seen anything like this. [PERSON] had a show [TIME]. She said, I have worked for everybody. I have worked for [PERSON] and nobody's ever seen anything like what is happening. It is a great thing. It is an incredible thing. This is supposed to be a little special speech, but you have never seen anything like this. Nobody's ever seen it. And what happened is, I think because of what they did when they said, We are going to silence his voice, it turned out to be a much bigger voice, and I think we now are going to [DATE], [GPE] has not been won. Between [PERSON], [PERSON], who comes from [GPE] I think [PERSON], a couple of other things, the riots, but I think what happened is they made this into a massive event and people are tired of it. And I think we will win [GPE]. We were very close last time. And we should win it, when they let [GPE] burn. We should win it, but I think we are going to win it. And again, [DATE] was the last time. Can you believe that? I think we are going to do it. We will find out. You are going to know in about Well, I hope, based on [ORG], they do not delay it too long, this decision [DATE]. I will tell you, it was not a good decision. You are allowed to wait [DATE] to count and [DATE] to have the final count? You are allowed to have time limits beyond [DATE]? So what does this mean? The whole world and our nation is going to be waiting, and waiting, and waiting to hear who won? You are going to be waiting for [DATE]? And a very dangerous thing happens. [DATE] and now you have to wait and wait. And very bad things can happen with ballots during that period of [DATE] to whatever date they gave them. [DATE]. So you are going to be watching on [DATE]. I think it is highly likely you are not going to have a decision because [GPE]'s very big and, as you know, there was another state, but perhaps other states involved. This is a terrible thing that they have done to our country. And that is [ORG] I am talking about. That is a terrible, political, horrible decision that they made. We are going to be waiting. [DATE] is going to come and go and we are not going to know. And you are going to have bedlam in our country and you are going to have this period of [DATE] or [DATE] or whatever it is. And many bad things Ballots are going to be Oh, we just found [CARDINAL] 000 ballots. Oh, that is good. We just found [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL]. This is a horrible thing that [ORG] has done to our country. And I say it and I say it loud and I say it proud. We have to know who won. We have to know who won. They tell you the police officers are villains. This is the group. And they are heroes. No. These even tell you that your children must be indoctrinated to believe that the heroes who crossed the Delaware were driven by hatred and malice. They change your history. A vote for [PERSON] is a vote to give this radical movement absolute power and unchecked control over every aspect of [NORP] life. [PERSON], who is not he is not all there. You should get a little bit of a larger frame, do not you think? No, there. I know those glasses. You have got to get a little I will tell him. He does not want to have people look at that surgery on the eyes. It did not work out. [PERSON] and the socialist left are absolutely convinced of their own moral superiority. I do not know if he is, but they are. He is not . Look, let us face it. He is shot. Same [inaudible [TIME]]. Who said that? Who is that? That was exact timing, right? You copied me from another [inaudible [TIME]]. While their agenda devastates the poor and The [NORP] middle class will be devastated. They support crippling shutdowns that crush the blue collar jobs while they stay home and work. They close down your schools, your children while they hire private tutors for their children. They ban you from going to church while they let left-wing extremists burn down your church. You can only meet if it is a protest. So you know what we do? Even in this [inaudible [TIME]]. I call this a protest. Otherwise, they do not let you meet. You cannot go to church, right? You cannot go to church. What they are doing to our churches and our synagogues and all of that is just terrible. You see what is going on. Even when the church wants to go into a field and stay apart, they say, No, you cannot do that. It is a terrible thing. They lecture you on the need for open borders that flood your cities with illegal drugs and gangs while they, themselves [NORP] that flood your cities with illegal drugs and gangs while they themselves live in walled-off compounds. They want to defund your police and confiscate your guns simultaneously, while they themselves are protected with armed guards. No, we will protect your second amendment [PERCENT]. There is [CARDINAL] way to preserve, protect, and defend the [NORP] way of life. You must show up on [DATE], okay? Do not worry about the first or second, because I know you too well. The [PERSON]/[PERSON] economic policies of increasing taxes and regulations, biggest tax increase in the history of our country is what they are proposing. Would pulverize our middle-class. Their plan is projected to hammer the typical [NORP] family's income by [MONEY] a year in [ORG]. By contrast, I cut taxes and regulations at a level nobody's ever done before, and raised middle-class families incomes' over $[MONEY], 000 in [DATE]. And that is not including energy, which is a tremendous, what we have done with energy is tremendous. [PERSON] has pledged a [MONEY] tax hike, socialized medicine, an avalanche of job killing regulations, a return to globalist trade deals. And he vowed the total destruction of the [GPE] oil industry and fracking, fracking has gone. Fracking is gone. Man. He said that loud and clear for [DATE] until he realized that he has to win in [GPE]. But fracking is dead because they are side it is dead. You saw [ORG] go out and say, no, no, no, you cannot say that when [PERSON] switched and he never had [CARDINAL] question from the press, how could you say it for [DATE], and then all of a sudden switch when you walk into [GPE]. Now, fracking would be dead. [PERSON] plan to abolish [NORP] energy is an economic death sentence for [GPE]. A vote for [PERSON] is a vote to ban fracking and to send your state into a nightmare of poverty and depression, that is what is going to happen. It is your single biggest industry by far, probably [CARDINAL] jobs one way or the other and what it would do to our country because our country has low energy costs. You and [GPE] and others. Think of [GPE]. He is running in [GPE]. We are doing very well in [GPE], but if you believe the fake news, they will tell you, Oh, it is very close. It is not close at all. And it was not close [DATE]. Think of [GPE]. It is very close. He is against oil, he is against guns, and he is against religion. And then they say, [GPE] is very close. Think of that, right? He is against oil, guns, and God, [GPE] is very close, too close to call. I do not think so. I think [GPE], [GPE] is going to be very strong for us. Can you imagine going into [GPE], say we are going to take your guns away, and by the way, we are going to close up every oil well that you have. Vote for me, vote for [PERSON]. I do not think so. I do not think so. If [PERSON] wins, there will be no fracking, no oil, no natural gas, no jobs, and no future. Under [PERSON], gas prices will explode, family incomes will plummet, and the fracking industry will be outlawed forever. Forever. With your vote, I will cut middle-class taxes even more. I mean, we cut them at the highest level in the history of our country, even more, and you saw what it did. That is why we are coming back so quick, because we have a strong foundation, a base. And I will always defend and promote [GPE] energy. And there will be no more lockdowns. We are not going to have lockdowns. We will never lock down again. [PERSON] would appoint the most radical left wing cabinet in history. [PERSON] will be in charge of gun confiscation. [PERSON] will be in charge of [ORG], according to what they say. [ORG] plus three will run the climate policy. I wonder if she ever even took a course in climate? I do not think so, I did not say it, you did. This can only happen in [GPE]. Do not forget, I went to school here. He likes to throw around the [GPE] thing. Look at it differently. He abandoned [GPE]. He went to [GPE], but I am not blaming. He was [DATE] or something, you cannot blame him for that, right? But he left [GPE]. I went to school in [GPE] as you know. Representative [PERSON] will be running [ORG]. How do you like that? Who knows? I just said that one, but you know what? I would not be surprised. Ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased to announce [PERSON] to run national security. She is going to run. She is going to be guarding our border, where we just had the best numbers we have ever had by the way. People can come into our country, we want them to come in. They have to come in legally and they have to come in through merit. Just imagine the insanity that will ensue. If [PERSON] is speaker, [PERSON] is, Crying [PERSON], majority leader. [PERSON], she makes [PERSON] look like a very strict conservative. [PERSON], got to say the name exactly right or they excoriate you. So you have [PERSON] running [ORG]. Well, she already said that, right? She said that it is the [PERSON]/Biden. He actually said that, that was scary. He said under the [PERSON], I never did that. I never said under the [PERSON]/Trump administration. And I love [PERSON]. You know what? But I said, [PERSON], that far we cannot go. But he said, he may never say, he also said he is running for [ORG] [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] times. He said, I am a proud [NORP]. This is like [CARDINAL], four times. I am a proud [NORP] running for [ORG]. And we said, No, [PERSON], you are running for president. Oh, okay. Is this whole thing, I mean, can you believe that, this could only happen to me. And how are you doing? We are tied. We are tied? How can I be tied? We are tied. He said [CARDINAL] times. The other thing he does badly, have not done it yet, I hope I never do, but he will be making a speech in [GPE], ladies and gentlemen of [GPE], it is proud to be. The worst is when he is making one in [GPE] with the palm trees. The beautiful palm trees. Ladies and gentlemen of [GPE]. He is made that many times. And you know what I always say? [PERSON] was a great, great order, right? Amazing orator, amazingly, because he was a stutterer in his life. He was a stutter and became a great orator. You could give a speech equal to the best that he is ever made. And if you made the mistake in saying welcome, like we are in [GPE], it is great to be in [GPE]. It does not matter how good your speech is, it is over. Just walk off, it is over. But he does it all the time, and nobody even says it. No, he is shot. Under my leadership, we achieved. And he is not a nice person. You know what? If he were a nice person, they do commercials on me that are so false. Like with the soldiers, that is the biggest insult to me of any thing that is probably ever happened, like with the soldiers and other things. This so falls based on a phony magazine, an [PERSON] type magazine, that is doing badly. They did a commercial, and we notified them. And we had [CARDINAL] witnesses, real witnesses. And every one of them is furious, but he is not a nice person. So because he is not a nice person, I do not mind saying exactly what I am saying, which as you know is the truth. He was never considered smart in his prime, but now he is really off. And you cannot have him as your president because he will destroy our country. He will destroy our country. And it probably will not be him because by the time he gets sworn in, he will be pretty much like it'll be over. 25th Amendment. Do you think they were talking about me? No, they were not talking about me. When she brought that up, they are talking about how to get [PERSON] in there as fast as possible. And nobody treated him worse than her. If you looked the debate, [PERSON] was failing fast, she was going down like a rock. Normally you pick somebody that is going up. She did not even make it to [GPE], right? Nobody spoke worse about him, and that is the one that they pick, but they want to get the radical left. They'd love to get her in. And that will be a very, I do not know. I do not know if you can never come back from a thing like that. I am not sure that a country, you look at [GPE], you look at what is going on, where it was the richest, it was so great [DATE]. Now, they do not have food. They do not have water. They do not have medicine. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in [NORP] history, the wall. [PERSON]'s planned to admit unlimited low wage foreign workers will slash incomes, surge unemployment, and devastate the middle class, all to enrich the globalist donors. As president, my only special interest is you. That is true. My only special interest. To protect our national security, I also suspended the entry of refugees from foreign nations compromised by terrorism, just call up President [PERSON] as I do often, and ask him what is happening over there? You saw those horrible attacks [DATE], [CARDINAL]. We are keeping radical [NORP] terrorists the hell out of our country, if I have your approval. [PERSON] has pledged a staggering [PERCENT] increase in refugees. This is a deal made between [PERSON] and [PERSON]. Crazy [PERSON], the manifesto we call it. There is a document, a very thick document, naming things that they are all horrible, but they have agreed. [PERCENT] increase in refugees from the most dangerous and violent terrorist hotspots anywhere on Earth, including [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE]. These are some of the most dangerous places in the world. [PERCENT] increase. This is agreed to. This is not like, oh, this is talk. This is a manifesto. It is a document. He is also vowed to terminate our national security travel bans, allowing for unlimited migration from war zones and terrorist havens. [PERSON]'s extreme migration policies will open the flood gates to terrorists, jihadists and violent extremists. You do not have to worry about it, just get out and vote on [DATE]. Under my administration, I had the ban passed, right? And it was approved by [ORG]. There, they did the right thing. Under my administration, the safest of our families will always come first. That safety, we want safety, has to come first. The Secretary of [ORG] under President [PERSON], [PERSON], said that [PERSON] has been on the wrong side of every foreign policy issue in his lifetime. President [PERSON] used to say that if you wanted something really screwed up, give it to [PERSON] to handle. This is the guy that we have running. In fact, [PERSON] tried to keep [PERSON] from running. He was very famously quoted as saying, [PERSON], you do not have to do this. You do not have to do this, [PERSON], do not do it. You do not have to do this. I could see that. And then would not endorse him until long after the primaries had ended and [PERSON] has lost. Think of it. He would not endorse him. He was a vice president, would not endorse him. Made all these terrible statements, would not endorse him. And then even after he won, it was [DATE] before he endorsed him, because he did not want to see it happen. I think he is probably the most surprised person on Earth, [PERSON]. And they said, Sir, [PERSON]'s going to start campaigning for him, [DATE]. I said, That is okay. That is good. He campaigned for [PERSON]. How did that work out? And his crowds are extraordinarily small, just so you understand. They are not big. They are like [CARDINAL] people, [CARDINAL] people. For [DATE], [PERSON] and [PERSON] have been inciting violence against police officers and riots, like those carried out by [PERSON] supporters in [GPE]. Look at what is going on in [GPE]. They should call us into [GPE]. We will solve the problem, or let their police handle the problem. Let their police handle the problem. If elected, the [NORP] ticket will pass legislation to end cash bail, create sanctuary cities nationwide, and defund police departments all across [GPE]. In a second term, we will increase funding for law enforcement. We will hire more tough [CARDINAL] crime prosecutors to put violent offenders behind bars. For [DATE], [PERSON] betrayed [NORP] at every turn. He took your votes. He took you for granted, and then he shipped away your jobs and flooded your cities with cheap foreign labor. He devastated black families with his [DATE] crime bill that really locked up [CARDINAL] of [NORP] men with unfair sentencing. And he called [NORP] young men, super predators all the time. He would say super predators, a name that has always been something, there has been no name that they have hated more. They hated it with [PERSON] and they hate it with [PERSON]. Super predator, the term super predator. That was his term. He forged close relationships with pro segregation lawmakers and his trade deals decimated the black middle class. [PERSON] cares more about refugees living [QUANTITY] away that he does about [NORP] living in [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE]. He is done nothing. And then he says to me, Oh, we should do this. I said, [PERSON], again, always, so easy. [DATE]. But he left. It was [DATE]. So this was not a long time ago. I reversed the injustice of [PERSON]'s crime bill by signing landmark criminal justice reform, prison reform. And under our recently announced platinum plan, we will create [CARDINAL] new jobs for [NORP], increase access to capital, restore safety to every neighborhood. And we will deliver school choice to every parent in [GPE]. And I am also fighting [DATE] for [NORP]. [DATE], I announced our American Dream Plan, and we are doing very well with [NORP]. You see that? They are saying, What is going on in [GPE], right? They like me and I like them. And we are doing very well with the Black community. They like me now, they are getting to know me better, but I have always liked them. The American Dream Plan, which creates [CARDINAL] new [NORP] owned small businesses and jobs and going to be fantastic for our [NORP], great people. My administration is also standing proudly with the people of [GPE], [GPE] and [GPE], and their righteous fight for freedom. [PERSON] sided with the brutal socialist and communist regimes. You said what he did. You said that horrible deal that was made with [GPE] by [PERSON] and [PERSON]. I do not think [PERSON] probably was too involved, if you want to know the truth, keep him out, but it was a terrible deal. It was like the [GPE] deal. Here is [CARDINAL] for nothing. As long as I am president, [GPE] will never be a socialist country, will never be. [DATE] I have laid out the boldest and most ambitious second term agenda in history. We will create [CARDINAL] new jobs in [DATE], we will have [CARDINAL] jobs over [DATE]. We will make [GPE] into the manufacturing superpower of the world. We will expand opportunity zones. We will bring home our medical supply chains they are all coming home. And we will end reliance on [GPE] once and for all. We will defend religious liberty, the right to life, and the right to keep and bear arms. And we will restore patriotic education to our schools. In our debate [DATE], [PERSON] said that [GPE] has, Never, ever lived up to our founding ideals, right? And he said it was an idea, it was just an idea. No, [GPE]'s a great country. [GPE] is a great country. It is not an idea. It is a great country. [NORP] know the truth more than most. When you think of the great history of this state, from [GPE]'s crossing and [FAC] in [GPE], to the [NORP] who ran the underground railroad. From the union soldiers who lay at the rest and you lay at rest, they lay at rest in [GPE]. What a place, [GPE], [CARDINAL] of the most beautiful places and so gruesome for a period of time, never fight uphill my boys, right? He said, Never fight uphill me boys, never fight uphill. They fought uphill. To the workers of [GPE] and [GPE] who forged the steel that won World War II. [GPE] is the story of everyday citizens who have given everything to help this country live up to the highest ideals. My fellow citizens, you deserve a president who believes in [GPE], a president who loves our country, and a president who loves you. Everybody knows that [PERSON] is not equipped to lead [GPE]. To [NORP], [NORP], and independents across this state, across this nation, I am asking for you to honor me with a vote that is going to make our nation greater than ever before. I will continue to fight for you with every breath in my body, and with your support on [DATE], we will show the world that for our country and for our children and for the incredible people of [GPE], the best is indeed yet to come. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsjoebidenungeneralassemblyspeechtranscriptclimateagendacovid19vaccines", "text": "Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, my fellow delegates, to all those who dedicate themselves to this noble mission of this institution. It is my honor to speak to you for the first time as president of [GPE]. We meet [DATE] in a moment of intermingled with great pain and extraordinary possibility. We have lost so much to this devastating pandemic that continues to claim lives around the world and impact so much on our existence. We are mourning [CARDINAL] people, people of every nation, from every background. Each death is an individual heartbreak, but our shared grief is a poignant reminder that our collective future will hinge on our ability to recognize our common humanity and to act together. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the clear and urgent choice that we face here at the dawning of what must be [DATE] for our world. [DATE] that will quite literally determine our futures. As a global community, we are challenged by urgent and looming crises, and where in lie enormous opportunities if we can summon the will and resolve to seize these opportunities. Will we work together to save lives, defeat COVID-19 everywhere and take the necessary steps to prepare ourselves for the next pandemic, for there will be another one? Or will we fail to harness the tools at our disposal as more virulent, dangerous variants take hold? Will we meet the threat of the challenging climate we are all feeling already ravaging every part of our world with extreme weather, or will we suffer the merciless march of ever worsening droughts and floods, more intense fires and hurricanes, longer heat waves and rising seas? Will we affirm and uphold the human dignity and human rights under which nations in common cause [DATE] formed this institution? Will we apply and strengthen the core tenants of the international system, including the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as we seek to shape the emergence of new technologies and deter new threats. Or will we allow those universal principles to be trampled and twisted in the pursuit of naked political power? In my view, how we answer these questions in this moment, whether we choose to fight for our shared future or not, will reverberate for generations yet to come. Simply put, we stand in my view at an inflection point in history. And I am here [DATE] to share with you how [GPE] intends to work with partners and allies to answer these questions. And the commitment of my new administration helped lead the world toward a more peaceful, prosperous future for all people. Instead of continuing to fight the wars of the past, we are fixing our eyes on devoting our resources of the challenges that hold the keys to our collective future. Ending this pandemic, addressing the climate crisis, managing the shifts in global power dynamics, shaping the rules of the world on vital issues like trade, cyber, and emerging technologies and facing the threat of terrorism as it stands [DATE]. We have ended [DATE] of conflict in [GPE]. And as we close this period of relentless war, we are opening a new era of relentless diplomacy, of using the power of our development aid to invest in new ways of lifting people up around the world, of renewing and defending democracy, proving that no matter how challenging or how complex the problems we are going to face, government by and for the people is still the best way to deliver for all of our people. And as [GPE] turns our focus to the priorities and the regions of the world, like the Indo-Pacific that are most consequential [DATE] and [DATE], we will do so with our allies and partners through cooperation and multilateral institutions like [ORG] to amplify our collective strength and speed, our progress toward dealing with these global challenges. It is the fundamental truth of [DATE] within each of our countries and as a global community, that our own success is bound up in other succeeding as well. To deliver for our own people, we must also engage deeply with the rest of the world to ensure that our own future, we must work together with other partners, our partners toward a shared future. Our security, our prosperity, and our very freedoms are interconnected in my view as never before. And so, I believe we must work together as never before. Over [DATE], I prioritized rebuilding our alliances, revitalizing our partnerships, and recognizing they are essential and central to [GPE]'s enduring security and prosperity. We have reaffirmed our sacred [ORG] commitment. We are working with our allies toward a new strategic concept that will help our alliance better take on the evolving threats of [DATE] and [DATE]. We renewed our engagement with [ORG], a fundamental partner in tackling the full range of significant issues facing our world [DATE]. We elevated the quad partnership among [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE] to take on challenges ranging from health security, to climate, to emerging technologies. We are engaging with regional institutions from [inaudible 00:07:10] to [ORG] to [ORG], to focus on people's urgent needs for better health and better economic outcomes. We are back at the table in international forums, especially [ORG] to focus attention and dispar global action on shared challenges. We are reengaged at [ORG] and working in close partnership with [PERSON] to deliver life-saving vaccines around the world. We rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement and we are running to retake a seat in [ORG] [DATE] at the [ORG]. And as [GPE] seeks to rally the world action, we will lead not just through the example of our power, but God willing with the power of our example. Make no mistake. [GPE] will continue to defend ourselves, our allies, and our interest against attack, including terrorist threats, as we prepare to use force, if any is necessary. But to defend our vital [GPE] national interest, including against ongoing and imminent threats. But the mission must be clear and achievable. Undertaken with informed consent of the [NORP] people. And whenever possible, in partnership with our allies. [GPE] military power must be our tool of last resort. Not our first. It should not be used as an answer to every problem we see around the world. Indeed, [DATE], many of our greatest concerns cannot be solved or even addressed through the force of arms. Bombs and bullets cannot- through the force of arms. Bombs and bullets cannot defend against COVID-19 or its future variants. To fight this pandemic, we need a collective act of science and political will. We need to act now to get shots and arms as fast as possible, and expand access to oxygen, tests, treatments to save lives around the world. And for the future, we need to create a new mechanism to finance global health security that builds on our existing development assistance and a global health threat council that is armed with the tools we need to monitor and identify emerging pandemics so that we can take immediate action. Already [GPE] has put [MONEY] toward the global COVID response. We have shipped [CARDINAL] doses of COVID-19 vaccine to other countries. This includes [CARDINAL] doses from our own supply and the first tranches of the [CARDINAL] doses of [ORG] vaccine, we purchased to donate through [ORG]. Planes carrying vaccines from [GPE] have already landed in [CARDINAL] countries, bringing people all over the world, a little dose of hope as [CARDINAL] [NORP] nurse termed it to me. A dose of hope direct from the [NORP] people and importantly, no strings attached. And [DATE] at the [GPE] hosted Global COVID-19 Summit, I will be announcing additional commitments as we seek to advance the fight against COVID-19 and hold ourselves accountable around specific targets on [CARDINAL] key challenges. Saving lives now, vaccinating the world, and building back better. [DATE] has also brought widespread death and devastation from the borderless climate crisis. The extreme weather events that we have seen in every part of the world, and you all know it and feel it represent what the Secretary General has rightly called code red for humanity. And the scientists and experts are telling us that we are fast approaching a point of no return in a literal sense. To keep within our reach the vital goal of limiting global warming to [QUANTITY], every nation needs to bring their highest possible ambitions to the table when we meet in [GPE] for COP26. And then to have to keep raising our collective ambition over time. In [DATE], I announced [GPE] ambitious new goal under the Paris Agreement. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions from [GPE] by [PERCENT] below [DATE] levels by [DATE], as we work toward achieving the clean energy economy with net [CARDINAL] emissions by [DATE]. And my administration's working closely with our [ORG] to make critical investments in green infrastructure and electric vehicles will help us lock in progress at home toward our climate goals. And the best part is making these ambitious investments is not just good climate policy, it is a chance for each of our countries to invest in ourselves and our own future. It is an enormous opportunity to create good paying jobs for workers in each of our countries and to spur long-term economic growth that will improve the quality of life for all of our people. We also have to support the countries and people that will be hit the hardest and that have the fewest resources to help them adapt. In [DATE], I announced that [GPE] will double our public international financing to help developing nations tackle the climate crisis. And [DATE], I am proud to announce that we will work with the [ORG] to double that number again, including for adaptation efforts. This will make [GPE] leader in public climate finance, and with our added support together with increased private capital from other donors, we will be able to meet the goal of mobilizing [MONEY] to support climate action in developing nations. As we deal with these crises, we are also encountering a new era. An era of new technologies and possibilities that have potential to release and reshape every aspect of human existence. And it is up to all of us to determine whether these technologies are forced to empower people or to deepen repression. As new technologies continue to evolve, we will work together with our democratic partners to ensure that new advances in areas from biotechnology to quantum computing, 5G, artificial intelligence, and more are used to lift people up, to solve problems and advance human freedom, not to suppress dissent or target minority communities. And [GPE] tends to make a profound investment in research and innovation, working with countries at all stages of economic development to develop new tools and technologies to help us tackle the challenges of [DATE] and beyond. We are hardening our critical infrastructure against cyber attacks, disrupting ransomware networks and working to establish clear rules of the road for all nations, as it relates to cyberspace. We reserve the right to respond decisively to cyber attacks that threaten our people, our allies, or our interest. We will pursue new rules of global trade and economic growth to strive a level of playing field. So it is not artificially tipped in favor of any one country at the expense of others. And every nation has the right and opportunity to compete fairly. We will strive to ensure that basic labor rights, environmental safeguards, and intellectual property are protected, and that the benefits of globalization are shared broadly throughout all our societies. We will continue to uphold the long-standing rules and norms that have formed the guardrails of international engagement for [DATE] that have been essential to the development of nations around the world. Bedrock commitments, like freedom of navigation, adherence to international laws and treaties, support for arms control measures to reduce the risk and enhance transparency. Our approach is firmly around it and fully consistent with [ORG] mission and the values we have agreed to when we drafted this charter. These are commitments we all made, and that we are all bound to uphold. And as we strive to deal with these urgent challenges, whether they are long-standing or newly emerging, we must also deal with one another. All of the major powers of the world have a duty, in my view, to carefully manage their relationships. So they do not tip from responsible competition to conflict. [GPE] will compete and we will compete vigorously and lead with our values and our strength. We will stand up for our allies and our friends and oppose attempts by stronger countries to dominate weaker ones, whether through changes to territory by force, economic coercion or technical exploitation or disinformation, but we are not seeking, say it again, we are not seeking a new cold war or a world divided into rigid blocks. [GPE] is ready to work with any nation that steps up and pursues peaceful resolution to share challenges even if we have intense disagreements in Even if we have intense disagreement in other areas, because we will all suffer the consequences of our failure, if we do not come together to address the urgent threats like COVID-19 and climate change or enduring threats like nuclear proliferation. [GPE] remains committed for ready to preventing [GPE] from getting a nuclear weapon. Where are working with the [ORG][ORG]1 to engage [GPE] diplomatically, and to seek a return to JCPOA. We are prepared to return to full compliance if [GPE] does the same. Similarly, we seek serious and sustained diplomacy to pursue the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We seek concrete progress toward an available plan with tangible commitments that would increase stability on the peninsula and in the region, as well as improve the lives of the people in [GPE]. We must also remain vigilant to the threat of terror, that terrorism poses to all our nations. Whether emanating from distant regions of the world, or in our own backyard. We know the bitter string of terrorism. The bitter sting of terrorism is real. We have almost all experienced it. [DATE], we lost [CARDINAL] [NORP] heroes and [CARDINAL] innocent [NORP] civilians in a heinous terrorist attack at [GPE] airport. Those who commit acts of terrorism against us will continue to find a determined enemy in [GPE]. The world [DATE] is not the world of [DATE] though, and [GPE] is not the same country we were when we were attacked on 9/11, [DATE]. [DATE], we are better equipped to detect, to prevent terrorist threats and we are more resilient in our ability to repel them and to respond. We know how to build effective partnerships to dismantle terrorist networks by targeting their financing and support systems, countering their propaganda, preventing their travel as well as disrupting imminent attacks. We will meet terrorist threats that arise [DATE] and the future with a full range of tools available to us, including working in cooperation with local partners so that we need not be so reliant on large scale military deployments. [CARDINAL] of the most important ways we can effectively enhance security and reduce violence is by seeking to improve the lives of the people all over the world, who see that their governments are not serving their needs. Corruption fuels inequality, siphons off a nation's resources, spreads across borders and generates human suffering. It is nothing less than a national security threat in [DATE]. Around the world, we are increasingly seeing citizens demonstrate their discontent. Seeing the wealthy and well connected grow richer and richer, taking payoffs and bribes, operating above the law while the vast majority of the people struggle to find a job or put food on the table or to get their businesses off the ground, or simply send their children to school. People have taken to the streets in every region to demand that their governments address people's basic needs, give everyone a fair shot to succeed and protect their God-given rights. And in that chorus of voices, across languages and continents, we hear a common cry. A cry for dignity, simple dignity. As leaders, it is our duty to answer that call, not to silence it. [GPE] has committed to using our resources and our international platform to support these voices, listen to them, partner with them, to find ways to respond that advance human dignity around the world. For example, there is an enormous need for infrastructure in developing countries. With infrastructure that is low quality or that feeds corruption or exacerbates environmental degradation, may only end up contributing to greater challenges for countries over time. Done the right way, however, with transparent, sustainable investment in projects that respond to the country's needs and engage their local workers to maintain high labor and environmental standards, infrastructure can be a strong foundation that allows societies in low and middle income countries to grow and to prosper. That is the idea behind the Build Back Better world. And together with the private sector and our [ORG] partners, we aim to mobilize [MONEY] in infrastructure investment. We will also continue to be the world's largest contributor to humanitarian assistance, bringing food, water, shelter, emergency healthcare, and other vital life-saving aid to [CARDINAL] of people in need. When the earthquake strikes, the typhoon rages or disaster anywhere in the world, [GPE] shows up, we will be ready to help. And at a time when [CARDINAL] in [CARDINAL] people globally do not have access to adequate food, adequate food [DATE], [GPE] is committing to rallying our partners to address immediate malnutrition and to ensure that we can sustainably feed the world for [DATE] to come. To that end, [GPE] is making a [MONEY] commitment to end hunger and invest in food systems at home and abroad. Since [DATE], the [GPE] government has provided [MONEY] to advance health and strengthen health systems. And we will continue our leadership to drive these vital investments to make people's lives better [DATE], just give them a little breathing room. And as we strive to make lives better, we must work with renewed purpose to end the conflicts that are driving so much pain and hurt around the world. We must redouble our diplomacy and commit to political negotiations, not violence, as a tool of first resort, to manage tensions around the world. We must seek a future of greater peace and security for all people of the Middle East. The commitment of [ORG], without question, are our support for an independent [NORP] state is unequivocal, but I continue to believe that a [CARDINAL]-state solution is the best way to ensure [GPE]'s future as a [NORP] democratic state, living in peace, alongside of viable sovereign and democratic [NORP] state. We are a long way from that goal at this moment, but we must never allow ourselves to give up on the possibility of progress. We cannot give up on solving raging civil conflicts, including in [GPE] and [GPE], who are fighting between warring parties is driving famine, horrific violence, human rights violations against civilians, including an unconscionable use of rape, as a weapon of war. We will continue to work with the international community, to press for peace and bring an end to this suffering. As we pursue diplomacy across the board, [GPE] will champion the democratic values that go to the very heart of who we are as a nation and a people. Freedom, equality, opportunity, and a belief in the universal rights of all people. It is stamped into our DNA as a nation and critically it is stamped into the DNA of this institution, [GPE], we sometimes forget. To quote the opening words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, quote, The equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the All members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world. The founding ethos of [ORG] places the rights of individuals at the center of our system, and that clarity and vision must not be ignored or misinterpreted. [GPE] will do our part, but we will be more successful and more impactful if all of our nations are working toward the full mission to which we are called. That is why [CARDINAL] nations united around a shared statement, and [ORG] adopted a resolution outlining how we will support the people of [GPE] moving forward, laying out the expectations to which we will hold the [ORG] when it comes to respecting universal human rights. We all must advocate for the rights of women and girls to use their full talents, to contribute economically, politically, and socially, and pursue their dreams free of violence and intimidation, from Central America to the Middle East to Africa to [GPE], wherever it appears in the world. We all must call out and condemn the targeting and oppression of racial, ethnic, and religious minorities, whether it occurs in [GPE] or northern [GPE] or anywhere in the world. We all must defend the rights of LGBTQI individuals so they can live and love openly without fear, whether it is [GPE] or [GPE] or anywhere. As we steer our nations toward this inflection point and work to meet [DATE]'s fast-moving, cross-cutting challenges, let me be clear. I am not agnostic about the future we want for the world. The future will belong to those who embrace human dignity, not trample it. The future will belong to those who unleash the potential of their people, not those who stifle it. The future will belong to those who give their people the ability to breathe free, not those who seek to suffocate their people with an iron hand. The authoritarians of the world may seek to proclaim the end of the age of democracy, but they are wrong. The truth is, the democratic world is everywhere. It lives in anti-corruption activists, human rights defenders, the journalists, the peace protesters, on the front lines of this struggle in [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and everywhere in between. It lives in the brave women of [GPE] who withstood violence and oppression to push a genocidal dictator from power and who keep working [DATE] to defend their democratic progress. It lives in the proud [NORP] who helped deliver a landslide victory for the forces of democracy with a mandate to fight graft to build a more inclusive economy. It lives in the young people of [GPE] who harnessed the power of their vote for the first time, turning out in record numbers to denounce corruption and chart a new path for their country. And while no democracy is perfect, including [GPE], we will continue to struggle to live up to the highest ideals to heal our divisions, and we face down violence and insurrection. Democracy remains the best tool we have to unleash our full human potential. My fellow leaders, this is the moment where we must prove ourselves the equals of those who come before us, who with vision and values and determined faith in our collective future built [ORG], broke the cycle of war and destruction, and laid the foundations for [DATE] of relative peace and growing global prosperity. Now we must again come together to affirm the inherent humanity that unites us is much greater than any outward divisions or disagreements. We must choose to do more than we think we can do alone, so that we accomplish what we must together. Ending this pandemic and making sure we are better prepared for the next one; staving off climactic climate change and increasing our resilience to the impacts we already are seeing; ensuring a future where technologies are the vital tool to solving human challenges and empowering human potential, not a source of greater strife and repression. These are the challenges that will determine what the world looks like for our children and our grandchildren and what they will inherit. We can only meet them by looking to the future. I stand here [DATE], for the first time in [DATE], [GPE] is not at war. We have turned the page. All the unmatched strength, energy, and commitment, will and resources of our nation, are now fully and squarely focused on what is ahead of us, not what was behind. I know this; as we look ahead, we will lead. We will lead on all the greatest challenges of our time, from COVID to climate, peace and security, human dignity and human rights, but we will not go it alone. We will lead together, with our allies and partners, in cooperation with all those who believe as we do, that this is within our power to meet these challenges, to build a future that lifts all of our people and preserves this planet. But none of this is inevitable. It is a choice. And I can tell you where [GPE] stands. We will choose to build a better future. We, you and I, we have the will and capacity to make it better. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot afford to waste any more time. Let us get to work. Let us make our better future now. We can do this. It is within our power and capacity. Thank you. God bless you all.", "discourse_type": 0}

Little [NORP] summer. I know the president spent some time in [GPE] [TIME], and apparently he complained about having to travel here. And then he cut the event short, poor guy. I do not feel that way. I love coming to [GPE]. You guys delivered for me twice and I am back here [TIME] to ask you to deliver [FAC] for [PERSON] and [PERSON]. I want to thank Mr. [PERSON], [PERSON], his daughter, [PERSON]. What an outstanding young lady she was. Those of you who are fathers and have daughters you know how that feels when you see your daughters just shining. I know a little bit about that. And it was great to see representatives, [PERSON], [PERSON], Governor [PERSON], Attorney General [PERSON], Mayor [PERSON]. [GPE] we got [DATE]. That is our lucky number right here. [DATE] until the most important election of our lifetimes. And you do not have to wait for [DATE] to cast your ballot. You have got [CARDINAL] ways to vote right now. Number [CARDINAL], you can vote early in person through [DATE]. Anybody here voted early already? If you have not , just go to iwillvote.com/pa and find out where you can vote early. Number [CARDINAL], you can vote from home with a mail-in ballot. Just go to iwillvote.com/pa to request your ballot right away. And before you send it back, [GPE]'s got this thing where you have got to use both envelopes. So you have got to read the directions carefully to make sure your vote counts. And if you have already voted, then you have got to help your friends and family make a plan to vote. Take them with you if you vote early, or if you vote in-person on [DATE], because this election requires every single one of us to do our part. And what we do [DATE] will matter for [DATE] to come. Now, last time I was in [GPE], I was at the constitution center and I was delivering a speech for the Democratic National Convention [DATE]. And I said, during that speech, I have sat in [FAC] with both of the men who are running for president. And they are very different people. I explained that I never thought [PERSON] would embrace my vision or continue my policies but I did hope for the sake of the country that he might show some interest in taking the job seriously, but it has not happened. He has not shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself and his friends or treating the presidency like a reality show that he can use to get attention. And by the way, even then his TV ratings are down. So you know that upsets him. But the thing is, this is not a reality show, this is reality. And the rest of us have had to live with the consequences of him proving himself incapable of taking the job seriously. [CARDINAL] 000 [NORP] have died. [CARDINAL] 000 small businesses have closed. [CARDINAL] of jobs are gone. Our proud reputation around the world is in tatters. Presidents up for reelection usually ask if the country is better off than it was [DATE]. I will tell you [CARDINAL] thing, [DATE] you'd be tailgating here at the [ORG] instead of watching a speech from your cars. The only people truly better off than they were [DATE] are the billionaires who got his tax cuts. Right now as we speak, [PERSON] will not even extend relief to the [CARDINAL] of families who are having trouble paying the rent or putting food on the table because of this pandemic. But he is been doing all right by himself. As it turns out, this was just reported in [TIME]. We know that he continues to do business with [GPE] because he is got a secret [NORP] bank account. How is that possible? How is that possible? A secret [NORP] bank account. Listen, can you imagine if I had had a secret [NORP] bank account when I was running for reelection. You think [ORG] might have been a little concerned about that? They would've called me [PERSON]. It is not a great idea to have a president who owes a bunch of money to people overseas. That is not a good idea. I mean, of the taxes [PERSON] pays, he may be sending more to foreign governments than he pays in [GPE]. His first year in [ORG] he only paid $[MONEY] in federal income tax. Listen, my first job was at [ORG] when I was [DATE]. I think I am might have paid more taxes [DATE] working at a dispensing ice cream. How is that possible? How many people here pay less than that? It is just possible now that if you are living high on the hog and you only pay $[MONEY] in taxes that maybe, just maybe he might not know what working people are going through here in [GPE]. We cannot afford [DATE] of this, [GPE]. But the good news is right now you can choose change. Right now you can vote for my friend [PERSON] and his running mate, [PERSON] as the next president and vice president of [GPE]. Now, [PERSON]'s no stranger to here. He is a native son. Scrappy kid from scratch. You know him and he knows you. But let me, let me tell you how I came to [PERSON] and how I came to love him. [DATE], when I chose [PERSON] as my vice presidential running mate, I did not know [PERSON] all that well. We had served in the [ORG] together, but we were not super close. He and I came from different places. We came from different generations. But I came to admire [PERSON] as a man who has learned early on to treat everybody he meets with dignity and respect, living by the words his parents taught him, no one's better than you [PERSON], but you are better than nobody. And that empathy, that decency, that belief that everybody counts, that is who [PERSON] is. That is who he will be. And I can tell you the presidency does not change who you are, it reveals who you are. And [PERSON] has shown himself to be a friend of working people. For [DATE], [PERSON] was the last one in the room when I faced a big decision. He made me a better president and he is got the character and experience to make us a better country. And he and [PERSON] A better country. And he and [PERSON] are going to be in the fight, not for themselves but for every single one of us. Well, I get that this president wants full credit for the economy he inherited and [CARDINAL] blame for the pandemic that he ignored. But you know what? The job does not work that way. Tweeting at the television does not fix things. Making stuff up does not make people's lives better. You have got to have a plan. You have got to put in the work. And along with the experience to get things done, [PERSON] has concrete plans and policies that will turn our vision of a better, fairer, stronger country into a reality. We literally left [ORG] a pandemic playbook that would have shown them how to respond before the virus reached our shores. They probably used it to I do not know, prop up a wobbly table somewhere. We do not know where that playbook went. [DATE] into this pandemic, cases are rising again across this country. [PERSON] is not suddenly going to protect all of us. He cannot even take the basic steps to protect himself. [TIME], he complained up in eerie that the pandemic made him go back to work. I am quoting him. He was upset that the pandemic's made him go back to work. If he'd actually been working the whole time, it never would've gotten this bad. So, look, here is the truth. I want to be honest here. This pandemic would have been challenging for any president but this idea that somehow [ORG] has done anything but completely screw this up. It is just not true. I will give you a very specific example. [GPE] identified it is first case at the same time that [GPE] did. At the same time, their per capita death toll is [PERCENT] of what ours is. In [GPE], it is [PERCENT] of what ours is. Other countries are still struggling with the pandemic but they are not doing as bad as we are because they have got a government that is actually been paying attention. And that means lives lost. And that means an economy that does not work. And [DATE], when asked if he'd do anything differently, [PERSON] said, Not much. Really? Not much? Nothing you can think of that could have helped some people keep their loved ones alive? So, [PERSON]'s not going to screw up testing. He is not going to call scientists idiots. He is not going to host a super spreader event at [FAC]. [PERSON] will get this pandemic under control with a plan to make testing free and widely available, to get a vaccine to every [NORP] cost free and to make sure our frontline heroes never ask other countries for their equipment they need. His plan will guarantee paid sick leave for workers and parents affected by the pandemic and make sure that the small businesses that hold our communities together and employ [CARDINAL] of [NORP] can reopen safely. [PERSON] likes to claim he built this economy but [GPE] created [CARDINAL] more jobs in [DATE] of the [PERSON]-Biden administration than in [DATE] of the [PERSON]-Pence administration. How you figure that? And that was before he could blame the pandemic. Now, he did inherit the longest streak of job growth in [NORP] history but just like everything else he inherited, he messed it up. The economic damage he inflicted by botching the pandemic response means he will be the first president since [PERSON] to actually lose jobs. [PERSON]'s got a plan to create [CARDINAL] good clean energy jobs as part of a historic [MONEY] investment to fight climate change, to secure environmental justice. And he will pay for it by rolling back that tax cut for billionaires. And [PERSON] sees this moment not just as a chance to get back to where we were but to finally make long overdue changes so that our economy actually makes life a little easier for everybody, the waitress trying to raise her kid on her own, the student trying to figure out how to pay for [DATE] classes, the shift worker who is always on the edge of getting laid off, the cancer survivor who is worried about her preexisting conditions, protections being taken away. Let me tell you something [GPE]. This I know to be true, [PERSON] and [PERSON] will protect your healthcare and expand [ORG] and make insurance more affordable for everybody. [NORP] love to say right before an election that they will protect your preexisting conditions. Now, [PERSON] and I actually protected your policies to make sure people with preexisting conditions could get health insurance and have coverage. We did it through something called the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a [ORG]. And [NORP] tried to repeal or undermine it [CARDINAL] times. And when they have been asked about, they keep on promising, We are going to have a great replacement. They said, It is coming. It is been coming in [DATE] for [DATE]. Where is it? Where is this great plan to replace Obamacare? They have had [DATE] to do it. There is no plan. They have never had one. Instead they have attacked the Affordable Care Act at every turn, driving up costs, driving up the uninsured. Now, they are trying to dismantle your care in [ORG] as we speak as quickly as they can in the middle of a pandemic with nothing but empty promises to take its place. It is shameful. The idea that you would take healthcare away from people at the very moment where people need it most, what is the logic of that? There is no logic. [PERSON] knows that the first job of a president is to keep us safe from all threats, foreign, domestic or microscopic. When the [DATE] intelligence briefings flash warning signs about a virus, a president cannot ignore them. He cannot be AWOL. Just like when [GPE] puts bounties on the heads of our soldiers in [GPE], the commander-in-chief cannot be missing in action. I can tell you this, [PERSON] would never call the men and women of our military suckers or losers. Who does that? He knows these heroes are somebody's children, somebody's spouse, somebody's dad or mom. He understands that. And he is going to restore our standing in the world because he knows that [GPE]'s true strength comes from setting an example that the world wants to follow. A nation that stands with democracy, not dictators, a nation that can mobilize and inspire others to overcome threats like climate change and terrorism and poverty and disease. And with [PERSON] and [PERSON] at the helm, you are not going to have to think about the crazy things they said [DATE]. And that is worth a lot. You are not going to have to argue about them [DATE]. It just will not be so exhausting. You might be able to have a [DATE] dinner without having an argument. You will be able to go about your lives knowing that the president is not going to retweet conspiracy theories about secret cabals running the world or that maybe seals did not actually kill [PERSON]. Think about that. The president of [GPE] retweeted that. Imagine. What? What? We are not going to have a president that goes out of his way to insult anybody who does not support him or threaten them with jail. That is not normal presidential behavior. That is not normal presidential behavior. We would not tolerate it from a high school principal. We would not tolerate it from a coach. We would not tolerate it from a co-worker. We would not tolerate it in our family, except for maybe crazy uncle somewhere. I mean, why would we expect and accept this from the President of [GPE]? And why are folks making excuses for that? Oh, well, that is just him. No. There are consequences to these actions. They embolden other people to be cruel and divisive and racist, and it frays the fabric of our society, and it affects how our children see things. And it affects the ways that our families get along. It affects how the world looks at [GPE]. That behavior matters. Character matters. And by the way, while he is doing all that, it distracts all of us from the truly destructive actions that his appointees are doing all across the government, actions that affect your lives. [ORG] that is supposed to protect our air and our water is right now run by an energy lobbyist that gives polluters free reign to dump unlimited poison into our air and water. [ORG] that is supposed to protect workers and their rights, right now it is run by a corporate lobbyist who is declared war on workers, guts protections to keep essential folks safe during a pandemic, makes it easier for big corporations to shortchange them on their wages. [ORG], that is supposed to protect our public lands and wild spaces, our wildlife and our wilderness. And right now that is run by an oil lobbyist who is determined to sell them to the highest bidder. You have got [ORG] that is supposed to give every kid a chance, and that is run by a billionaire who guts rules designed to protect students from getting ripped off by for profit colleges and stiffs arm students looking for loan relief in the middle of an economic collapse. I mean, the person who runs [ORG] right now is doing their best to kick people off of [ORG] instead of sign them up for [ORG]. Come on. When [PERSON] and [PERSON] are in charge, they are not going to surround themselves with hacks and lobbyists, but they are going to appoint qualified public servants who actually care about looking out for you, for your job, for your family, for your health, for your security, for your planet, and that more than anything is what separates them from their opponents. They actually care about every [NORP], including the ones that do not agree with them. And they are going to fight for you [DATE]. They care about you and they care about this democracy. They believe in a democracy. The right to vote is sacred and that we should not be making people wait in line for [TIME] to cast their ballot. We should be making it easier for everybody to vote. They believe that no one, especially the President, is above the law. They understand that protest on behalf of social justice is not [NORP]. That is the most [NORP] thing there is. That is how this country was founded, protesting injustice. They understand we do not threaten our political opponents threatening to throw them in jail, just because we disagree with them. They understand that our ability to work together to solve big problems like a pandemic depends more than on just photo-ops. It depends on actually learning the facts and following the science and not just making stuff up whenever it is convenient. Our democracy is not going to work if the people who are supposed to be our leaders lie [DATE] and just make things up. And we have just become numb to it. We have just become immune to it. Every single day, fact checkers cannot keep up. And, look, this notion of truthfulness and democracy and citizenship, and being responsible, these are not [NORP] or democratic principles, they are [NORP] principles. They are what most of us grew up learning from our parents and our grandparents. They are not [NORP] or [NORP] or [NORP] or [NORP] values, they are [NORP] values, human values, and we need to reclaim them. We have to get those values back at the center of our public life. And we can. But to do it, we have got to turn out like never before. We cannot leave any doubt in this election, because you know the President's already said, If this is even close, I am going to just make stuff up. He is already started to do it. So we cannot have any doubt. We cannot be complacent. I do not care about the polls. There were a whole bunch of polls last time, did not work out, because a whole bunch of folks stayed at home and got lazy and complacent. Not this time, not in this election, not this time. Listen, listen. I understand why a lot of [NORP] can get frustrated by government and can feel like it does not make a difference. Even supporters of mine, during [DATE], there were times where stuff we wanted to get done did not get done and people said, Well, gosh, if [PERSON] did not get it done, then maybe it is just not going to happen. Look, government is not going to solve every problem, it is true. Every elected officials going to make some mistakes. This is a big complicated country and the system's designed so that change happens slowly. It does not happen [TIME]. And believe me, I have got firsthand experience with the way [NORP] in [ORG] abused the rules to make it easy for special interest to stop progress. But we can make things better, and we should not be making things worse. A president by himself cannot solve every challenge in a global economy. But if we have got [PERSON] and [PERSON] in [FAC] at a [ORG] and [ORG] that are focused on working people, it can make a difference and get [CARDINAL] of people the help they need. A president by himself cannot eliminate all racial bias in our criminal justice system. But if we have got district attorneys and state's attorneys and sheriffs and police chiefs focused on equality and justice, it can make things better. In [GPE], you have just got to flip [CARDINAL] seats in your [ORG], just [CARDINAL] seats in your [ORG], to give [NORP] control and new life for policies that'll make a real difference to working families right now. It can make things better. In the end, [GPE], that is what voting's about, making things better, not making things perfect, but putting us on track so that [DATE] we can look back and say, Things got better starting now. And that is what voting's about. Voting's about using the power we have and pooling it together to get a government that is more concerned and more responsive and more focused on you and your lives and your children and your grandchildren and future generations. And the fact that we do not get [PERCENT] of and future generations. And the fact that we do not get [PERCENT] of what we want right away is not a good reason not to vote. It means we have got to vote and then get some change and then vote some more and then get some more change, and then keep on voting until we get it right. And we will never come close to seeing what it would be like if everybody voted, when I hear people say, Well, I do not know, you are voting do not make a difference. We do not know because usually [CARDINAL] the people who could be voting vote. We get [PERCENT] of people voting. And then people say, Well, look, not enough change happened. Well, imagine what would happen if [PERCENT] voted? What about [PERCENT]? Imagine [DATE], when we swear in a president and a vice president who have a plan to get us out of this mess, who believe in science, and they have a plan to protect this planet for our kids, and who care about working [NORP], and they have a plan to help you start getting ahead. And who believe in racial equality and gender equality, and believe in not discriminating against people because of their sexual orientation, and are willing to bring us closer to an [GPE] where no matter what we look like and where we come from, who we love and what our last name is, if we go out there and we work, we can make it. And we are part of an [NORP] family. All of that is possible. All of that is within our reach, if we vote. Because let me tell you something [NORP], people ask me sometimes, they say, Man, how have you been able to take [DATE], just watching all this? How do you keep your spirits up? And I tell him, I say, look for all the times, [DATE] that we have seen our worst impulses revealed, we have also seen what our country can be at its best. We have seen folks of every age and background who've packed city centers and airports in town squares, just so families would not be separated. So another classroom would not get shot up, so our kids would not grow up on an uninhabitable planet. We have seen [NORP] more racist, joining together to declare in the face of injustice that black lives matter, no more, but no less, so that no child in this country feels the continuing sting of racism. We have seen folks, our essential workers, our healthcare workers risking their lives [DATE] in day out to save somebody else's loved ones. We have seen people volunteer and contribute to help those who are having an especially difficult time that right now. That is true in [GPE], that is true all across the country. [GPE] is a good and decent place, but we have just seen so much noise and nonsense that sometimes it is hard for us to remember. [GPE], I am asking you to remember what this country can be. What it is like when we treat each other with respect and dignity, what it is like when our elected officials actually behave responsibly. I am asking you to believe in [PERSON]'s ability, in [PERSON]'s ability to lead this country out of these dark times, and help us build it back better, because we cannot abandon those who are hurting right now. We cannot abandon the children who are not getting the education they need right now. We cannot abandon those protesters who inspired us. We have got to channel their activism into action, we cannot just imagine a better future. We have got to fight for it. We have got to out hustle the other side, we got to outwork the other side, we have got to vote like never before and leave no doubt. So make a plan right now, for how you are going to get involved and vote. Do it as early as you can. Tell your family, tell your friends how they can vote. Do not stop with [PERSON] and [PERSON], make sure you vote all the way down the ticket. And if we pour all our efforts into [DATE], if we vote up and down the ticket, like never before, then we will not only elect [PERSON] and [PERSON], we will also leave no doubt about what this country that we love stands for. We will not leave any doubt about who we are as a people, and the values and ideals that we embrace. What [PERSON] called the better angels of our nature, those are still in us. We see them operating [DATE]. We see them in neighborhoods, we see them in churches and synagogues and mosques and temples. We see them in people helping out a neighbor. We see them them inside our own families. We see that what is best in us is still there, but we have got to give it voice, and we have got to do it now. So let us get to work people. Let us bring this home. I love you, [GPE]. Honk if you are fired up, honk if you are ready to go. Are you fired up? Let us go make it happen. I love you [GPE]. Thank you. I love you. Come on.", "discourse_type": 0}

He was [inaudible [TIME]] but he will be up there very soon. He is doing good. Come on sit down please. Let us have some fun. I really am thrilled to be here in [GPE], [GPE] with the extraordinary men and women of [ORG], and what a nice welcome. Thank you very much. [inaudible [TIME]] big beautiful rigs behind me. Thanks to the hard working citizens like you in [GPE] this is now the number [CARDINAL] energy superpower anywhere in the world, so congratulations. It is not that easy, but no one said it is easy. We are here [DATE] to celebrate your incredible achievements, we are also here to send a clear message to the [NORP] radicals and extremists trying to shut down your and to make [GPE] subservient to foreign producers. That will not happen to this nation again. Long time to be independent and. A long time to be independent, and as long as I am your president, we will never let anyone put [NORP] energy out of business, which is what they'd like to do. We will never again be relying on hostile foreign suppliers. We will defend your jobs and we will defend [GPE], I love this state. We will defend [NORP] who found energy independence. Before going any further I want to provide you with a brief update on our battle against the [GPE] virus. Our hears are with the people of [GPE]. We love our people. We love our country. Statewide presentive patients testing positive has stabilized, and the number of new cases has begun to substantially decline. But [NORP] must remain vigilant. To protect our seniors my administration has deployed personal protective equipment and rapid point of care testing systems to every [ORG] and [ORG]-certified nursing home in your state. No matter where you go they have it. [DATE], access hospitals are receiving [CARDINAL] cases of antiviral treatment remdesivir. It is been very, very successful. Enough to treat [CARDINAL] patients. Under my administration's Operation Warp Speed, we are developing vaccines in record time. [DATE], a promising vaccine entered the final stage of clinical trials long ahead of schedule, with more following very quickly behind. We have some of the greatest companies, labs in the world doing this. This is the fastest a vaccine has ever been developed. Together we will end the plague from [GPE]. We will defeat the virus. I want to thank everyone at [ORG] for hosting us [DATE], including co-founders, [CARDINAL] great, young, smart people, [PERSON] and [PERSON]. Thank you, [PERSON]. Thank you, [PERSON]. Thank you fellas. Good job. Thanks also to anterior secretary [PERSON]. [PERSON], thank you. [ORG] secretary [PERSON], [GPE] says keep him, we really kept him very busy. Where is [PERSON]? You have been kept very busy, very busy. A great Senator and a great friend of mine, Senator [PERSON]. [PERSON], thank you. He is out there fighting for you. I want to tell you. Thank you [PERSON]. Representatives, and these are friends of mine and they are warriors, [PERSON] and [PERSON], thank you fellas. Thank you. Thank you. Great job. A very, very special man and a very special talent, Governor [PERSON]. Thank you. Thank you, [PERSON]. Great job you are doing. He is working hard and you are doing a fantastic job. Our people are working together and you are getting everything you need. So good. Thank you for doing such a good job and thank also [PERSON], your Lieutenant governor, my friend. Thank you very much, [PERSON]. Great help, great team. No better team in the country. Thank you. [GPE] judge, [PERSON]. Thank you [PERSON]. Thank you. Your former governor, a great man, a friend of mine, secretary of energy, [PERSON]. Nobody did a better job than my [PERSON]. Thank you [PERSON]. We have so many other distinguished guests and local leaders and we just want to thank you all for being here. Thank you all very much. Great honor. Thank you very much for being here. Under the last administration, [GPE]'s energy industry was under relentless and unceasing attack, you know that. But [DATE] I took the oath of office, we ended the war on [NORP] energy and we stopped the far left assault on [NORP] energy workers. Now the assault, you have seen what is going on. It could come again. But I have a very strong feeling you are not going to have to worry about it. If you do you are in big, big trouble. I withdrew from the [CARDINAL]-sided, energy destroying Paris Climate Accord. It was a disaster. It cost us [MONEY] and it would have made us a noncompetitive nation. We canceled the [PERSON] administration's job crushing clean power plan. You know all about that. I improved [FAC] and [FAC] immediately upon assuming office. We opened up [FAC] in [GPE] to energy exploration, ended the moratorium on coal leasing on federal lands and reopened public lands and offshore areas to oil and gas exploration. That is where [PERSON]'s done such a great job. Thanks [PERSON]. We unlocked the full energy potential of [GPE] and [GPE], and [GPE], we are proud that we have been here. We are proud to help. You have been fantastic. A lot of jobs. Since my election oil and gas production in the Permian Basin has more than doubled. Under [ORG] [GPE] has increased oil production by [QUANTITY] per day. That is some number, never been anything like that number. For the first time in [DATE], we have become a net energy exporter, and [GPE] is now the number [CARDINAL] producer of oil and natural gas on the face of the earth. To ensure we maintain this dominant position long into the future, we will never lose this position, my administration is announcing [DATE] that export authorizations for [NORP] liquified natural gas can now be extended through [DATE]. Mr. [PERSON] is that long enough? Okay, [DATE], that seems like a long time. He said let us make it longer. At the same time, we are strongly protecting our environment. Air pollution is down significantly since I took office. While other countries are polluting the world's air and oceans, we will never cease to be a leader in protecting our natural environment and that is what is happening. People do not know that about us. We love our environment. Under my administration [GPE] will continue to have among the cleanest air and cleanest water anywhere on earth and that is what we have. Thanks to our [NORP] energy policies, we are also taking jobs in factories away from countries with poor environmental standards, such as [GPE], and bringing jobs back to [GPE], where they belong. Before the invisible enemy struck our shores, we created [CARDINAL] 000 new energy jobs, a third of them in [GPE]. That was just the new jobs. Add onto that [CARDINAL] of other jobs. After the [GPE] virus struck we implemented historic economic relief. When oil crashed, I got [GPE], [GPE] and others to cut [QUANTITY] a day and got [ORG] plus and [GPE] to agree to the deal and hence we are okay. Now we are back. We are back. I will tell you, and I can tell you that I spoke with [PERSON] and [PERSON] and I spoke with Senator [PERSON], I spoke with a lot of people and we were very close to losing a very powerful, great industry, and we did a job. We did a great job all together, working together, a job like I think nobody could have done, and now we are back and now we are just going to keep expanding. You will see. It is happening, but we really did. We did a great job and I want to thank, frankly, [GPE]. I want to thank [GPE]. I want to thank [GPE], and I want to thank [ORG] as they call it, Plus. It is called [ORG]. That is [ORG], Plus a lot of other countries. But they all came to together and they did a job for the industry and we appreciate everybody's help. This action stabilized world oil prices that had been in a free fall and saved [CARDINAL] of energy jobs, and frankly it saved your industry. [DATE] people were very, very concerned about that industry, and now it is just going to be a question of how fast will you put people on. Through [ORG] we provided [MONEY] in emergency aid to keep [GPE] energy workers on the payroll. We kept them all in the payroll. We opened up [QUANTITY] of space in Strategic Petroleum Reserve, allowing [NORP] companies to store surplus oil to be sold at a later time, and we filled up our [QUANTITY] in the Strategic Reserve. And [PERSON], you have done a fantastic- In the strategic reserve and [PERSON] you have done a fantastic job on that. Thank you very much. I only wish he bought it when the oil was selling for [CARDINAL] and they paid you $[MONEY] in addition. You get a barrel plus $[MONEY], I said, [PERSON], why did not you make that deal? I would have loved that, but you did well. Thank you very much. [DATE] I am taking another bold action to support energy jobs in [GPE]. In [TIME], I will sign [CARDINAL] critical permits granting approval to vital pipeline and railway infrastructure on our nation's border. That is a big deal, this will include [CARDINAL] permits allowing the export of [GPE] crude to [GPE], a giant victory for the workers of this state that you have been after for [DATE], right? You have been after that one for [DATE]. I said, What do I know about it? If you want to do it, it is okay with me, and we are doing it, so that is been a long time in the making. We are joined [DATE] by some of the incredible patriots of the [GPE] oil and gas industry who are benefiting from [GPE]'s energy boom. [PERSON] [inaudible [TIME]] was born and raised right here in [GPE] and [GPE], where is [PERSON]? Thank you [PERSON]. After spending [DATE] away at school, [PERSON] came back home to West Texas. [PERSON]'s dad worked on the oil rigs. [PERSON] worked on the oil rigs and he hopes his [CARDINAL] children will work [DATE] doing the same kind of incredible work and looking for the wonderful opportunities in [NORP] energy. [PERSON], thank you very much. Congratulate your family. You are going to have a great future. Thank you. Appreciate it. [PERSON] spent [DATE] in the army, supporting our victory in the Gulf War. Then he became Hello, [PERSON]. Thank you [PERSON]. Then he became an energy worker. Did you make the right move, [PERSON]? I think so, right? Better believe it. With [DATE] of experience, [PERSON], a senior pumper with [ORG], do they treat you well? They better, they better, I am going to come back and see those [CARDINAL] guys. Just like [CARDINAL] of other veterans who work in this industry, [PERSON] has made [GPE] safer with his service and now he is helping keep us secure by maintaining [NORP] energy independence which we have. Thank you very much [PERSON]. Great job. To [PERSON] and every veteran who works in the [NORP] energy sector, we salute your noble service and we thank you very much, we thank you very much, everybody, thank you. While my administration is fighting for workers like you, the radical left, have you ever heard of the radical left, [PERSON]? You do not want to hear about them. You do not want to know about them, is fighting to abolish [NORP] energy, destroy the oil and gas industries and wipe out your jobs. [GPE] [NORP] have embraced Representative [PERSON]'s [MONEY] Green New Deal disaster. I have added the fourth word, it is a disaster, which would ban oil and gas leasing on all federal lands and by the way there would be no fracking, so let me ask you Mr. [PERSON], how do you think that works in [GPE]? No fracking, no drilling, no oil, is that okay? Good. I do not think [PERSON]'s going to do too well in [GPE]. He is already written it off, it is gone. No fracking, that is part of his platform. If these far left politicians ever get into power, they will demolish not only your industry but the entire [GPE] economy. Their stated agenda includes rejoining the Paris Climate Accord, spending [MONEY] in order to make us non-competitive, and seeking an even higher level of restrictions mandating net [CARDINAL] carbon emissions which frankly is impossible, for all new homes, offices and buildings by [DATE], not possible to do, and if you ever did it, it would cost so much that your home would be valueless. This would cause the cost of construction to skyrocket and effectively end the use of natural gas in homes because it would be an impossible situation. They are asking for things, just so you understand, that are impossible. I do not know, I have not checked recently, what have they done with cows? Remember there were going to be no more cows and no more cattle. I think they might have left that one off the manifesto but it will be back. Their platform calls for mandating [CARDINAL] carbon emissions from power plants by [DATE]. In other words, no drilling, no fracking, no coal, no shale, no gas, no oil. Otherwise they have been very good to the industry I think. You got to be careful. People do not take it seriously. If they got in, you will have no more energy coming out of the great state of [GPE], out of [GPE], out of anywhere. [GPE], [GPE], name them. [GPE], [GPE] does a lot. People do not realize that, a lot. It would throw [GPE], [GPE], so many other places, you do not realize how big it is, they want to have no fracking, no nothing. The policies required to implement this extreme agenda would mean the death of [NORP] prosperity and the end of the [NORP] middle class. It would mean I think even worse than that. It would destroy our country. I used to say we would become another [GPE], same ideology, you would become another [GPE]. [GPE] used to be [CARDINAL] of the richest in the world per capita and period [CARDINAL] of the richest in the world, among the largest oil reserves. Now they do not have water, they do not have medicine, they do not have food, you got a lot of oil, it does not matter. Does not seem to matter. They do not have anything, and that can happen to us. All you have to do is look at [GPE], look at the agitators, look at the anarchists in [GPE] and our people have done a great job in protecting our courthouse and I told my people a little while ago, if they do not solve that problem locally very soon, we are going to send in [ORG] and get it solved very quickly just like we did in [GPE] and just like we will do in other places. They want to solve their problem, they have got a very short time to do it, but they will either solve their problem or we send in [ORG]. The [GPE] energy industry would grind to a halt and every single energy producing state would be plunged into a depression. [CARDINAL] jobs would vanish [TIME] in just the state of [GPE] alone, and I think the number's probably Greg a lot higher than [CARDINAL]. [CARDINAL] more would disappear in [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE]. By imposing these punishing restrictions and beyond restrictions, the [GPE] radical left crazy [NORP] would also send countless [NORP] jobs, factories, industries to [GPE] and to other foreign polluting states. They want us to take care of our air but [GPE] does not take care of its air. In all fairness, [GPE] does not take care of its air. [GPE] does not take care of its air, but we do. Not on my watch it is not going to happen I can tell you that. Because as long as I am president, we will always put [GPE] first. It is very simple, very simple. For [DATE] and [DATE] we put other countries first. We now put [GPE] first. As we have seen in cities and towns across our nation, it is not just [GPE] oil that the radical [NORP] want to destroy, they want to destroy our country. These people are sick. They are sick and you better get used to hearing it because they have some real problems. They do not love our country. In any way, shape or form, they do not love our country. There is no respect for the [NORP] way of life. There is no way of life ever in history that is been like the great [NORP] way of life. There is no respect but there is by you and there is by [PERCENT] of our people. Our people love our country and our people love our anthem and they love our flag. Remember that. The radical left wants to tear down everything in its way and in its place they want power for themselves, they want power. Hard to believe, power. They want to uproot and demolish every [NORP] value. They want to wipe away every trace of religion from national life. They want to indoctrinate our children, defund our police, abolish the suburbs, incite riots, and leave every city at the mercy of the radical left. That is not going to happen. That is not going to happen. By the way, I just ended the rule on suburbs. You know the suburbs, people fight all of their lives to get into the suburbs and have a beautiful home. There will be no more low income housing forced in to the suburbs. I abandoned and took away and just rescinded the rule. It is been going on for [DATE], I have seen conflict for [DATE]. It is been hell for suburbia. It is been hell for suburbia. We rescinded the rule [DATE], so enjoy your life, ladies and gentlemen. Enjoy your life. The proud people of [GPE] will never bow, kneel or surrender to the left-wing mob. You will always stand tall and strong for [GPE]. Everyone here [DATE] carries the legacy of some of the toughest, fiercest, and most determined people ever to walk the face of the earth, your ancestors. You know that. You know that generations of [GPE] oil workers before you gave every last bit of sweat and heart and grit that they had to build up this country. They loved our country. They loved our country so much they could not breathe. Their pride and devotion help raise up [GPE] cities, power our factories, propel our industries, sustain our families, supply our military and fuel [GPE]'s rise into the strongest, wealthiest and greatest nation the world has ever known. We are now at the strongest point militarily, we have ever been due to I will tell you, [PERSON]? Where is [PERSON]? He was a big leader in this. Stand up again, [PERSON]. [PERSON], [PERSON], and our [ORG] and our [ORG] approved [MONEY] to rebuild entirely the [GPE] military. It is now at a point that it is the strongest it is ever been. A lot of the equipment is still coming in, brand new planes and missiles and everything you can think of. And I want to thank you, [PERSON]. You were one of the real leaders, and [PERSON] too. The [CARDINAL] of you, I appreciate it very much. You are well-represented. We have the greatest equipment on earth. We have equipment that I cannot even tell you about. You do not want to know about it, frankly, and hopefully we'd never have to use it. Now it is your turn to help lead our nation to even greater heights. [DATE] we give thanks for each and every one of you. And we are telling the [GPE] politicians trying to abolish [NORP] energy, do not mess with [GPE]. And I just want to finish by saying that I have had a great relationship with your leaders, with your politicians. With all the people in [GPE], we have had great success. We had a great victory. They said, Oh, I do not know if he will win. And we won. Not only did we win, we won quickly and easily. And now we are leading what we had even [DATE]. I will never let you down. I will never let [GPE] down. And your governor and lieutenant governor and your senators, they know that very well. Thank you. And thank you very much, [PERSON]. [PERSON], thank you very much. [PERSON], thank you. Great job. God bless you, and the great state of [GPE], God bless you. God bless you. On behalf of every [NORP] energy worker, I will now sign these very important permits that your governor and your senators have been after me for a long time to sign. And they have been after a lot of other presidents to sign them, but they never were able to get it done. But we got it done. And we got it done for a great state called [GPE]. Thank you very much everybody.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsjoebidenlasvegasspeechtranscriptoctober9", "text": "a widow and a dear friend of an [NORP] hero, [PERSON]. We also saw the resilience and the goodness of decency of the [NORP] people. They are not looking for a handout, they just want a fair shot. My dad used to have an expression when he lost his job up in [GPE]. When I was in grade school, my dad would say, and we had to move in with my grandparents. When he went down south from [GPE] to [GPE], [GPE] looking for a job. And he used to always say that, The fact is [PERSON], I am not looking for government to solve my problems but I hope like hell they can at least understand my problems. He finally got a job, we could afford to buy a small home. He worked hard to build a decent middle class life. It was not easy for him, but he had an expression. As I said, a job joy about a lot more than a paycheck. It is about your dignity. It is about respect. It is about your place in the community. It is being uable to look your kidney eye and say, Honey, it is going to be okay. You deserve a president who understands what you are going through. Who sees you where you are and where you want to be. The last thing you need is a president who ignores you, looks down upon you, who just does not understand who in God's name we are. That is President [PERSON]. His reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis. The destabilizing effect it is having on our government is unconscionable. He did not take the necessary precautions to protect himself or others. And the longer [PERSON] is President, the more reckless he gets. How can we trust him to protect this country? Governor, you have seen how he picks fights with states and pits them against one another. Look, what is happened. [CARDINAL] 000 [NORP] are dead. [CARDINAL] have been hospitalized. We lose [CARDINAL] people [DATE] in [GPE], worse than any country in the world. [CARDINAL] [NORP] have been infected. And we are still counting. And here in [GPE], there have been [CARDINAL] 000 cases in total. [CARDINAL] deaths. [PERCENT] of those deaths have been seniors over [DATE]. Black, [NORP], [NORP], [NORP] communities are especially hit hard. Nationally, the infection rate among [NORP] is [CARDINAL] times higher than that of white [NORP] and the death rate as well as [CARDINAL] times higher. [CARDINAL] 000 [NORP] have died from COVID-19. My heart goes out to all those families who got up [TIME] and there was an empty chair around the kitchen table. Or go to dinner [TIME] and the person that should be there is gone. They have lost part of their soul. They have lost part of their life. It is all about family. With you and I it is all about family. Losing family is a devastating thing. We can do so much better. My heart goes out to everyone struggling with the economic crisis caused by the neglect, the simple neglect of this President. [CARDINAL] jobs lost since the beginning of this crisis. And they still have not come back, including [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] jobs here in [GPE]. Temporary layoffs have turned to permanent layoffs. Record growth [DATE] and a number of [NORP] facing long-term unemployment. And the problem of long-term unemployment, once you get beyond a certain point, history shows us that they never get a job again. All told, there are now [CARDINAL] workers who either lost [TIME], lost paychecks, or lost their jobs entirely. [CARDINAL], 000 people have dropped out of the labor force [DATE]. And the vast majority were women. We are still down [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis has started. And our balance of payments deficit is going up. And here in [GPE], the unemployment rate is [PERCENT], the highest in the nation because of President [PERSON]'s negligence. The hospitality industry has hit particularly hard. The culinary union, has recently said publicly that [PERCENT] of their members are still out of work. Tourism in [DATE] was down [PERCENT] from [DATE]. The result? President [PERSON] will be the first president in modern history since [PERSON] to leave office with fewer jobs than he had when he came into office. Here in [GPE], after seeing [CARDINAL] 000 jobs created in [DATE] of the [PERSON]-Biden administration, [GPE] has actually seen jobs go down under the [PERSON] presidency. He is leaving us with what he calls, he says is a V-shape recession. It is a K-shaped recession where those at the top keep going up and the middle-class and everyone else keeps going down, getting worse. Means essential workers who sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in modern history. You get this, the top [CARDINAL] billionaires in [GPE] have done pretty well. Just in the pandemic, the top [CARDINAL] billionaires have made [MONEY], top [CARDINAL]. But you get the bottom [CARDINAL] of that K and it is a downward slide. You are left to figure out how you are going to pay your bills, put food on the table. So much food insecurity in [GPE], in this state. How to balance doing your job with being a teacher for your kids because of the negligence of the President, they cannot go back to school because they have not provided the wherewithal for schools to open. You are asked to risk your neck because you cannot work from home where the risk of COVID are kept outside. That is because you are a police officer, a firefighter, a nurse, or you are working on an assembly line in customer service or a checkout counter, or here in [GPE] in hospitality. If you are a housekeeper, a casino worker, the ones who built this very stage. Governor [PERSON], your members of [ORG] are doing everything they possibly can to help turn things around. Governor, you have been focused and responsible. You followed science and put public health and safety. You made tough calls that saved lives. Working around the clock so we can reopen schools and the economy safely. Your members of [ORG], have done the same. And the [ORG] passed what they call the HEROES Act [DATE]. Would have provided [MONEY] to help states keep first responders on the job. The safety measures needed, the PPP needed to open our schools and businesses but [PERSON] and [PERSON], [NORP] leader did nothing to move the legislation. Nothing in [DATE], nothing in [DATE], nothing in [DATE], nothing in [DATE], things getting worse and worse and worse. And as people struggled and suffered, what did they focus on? If this was not so serious, you'd think I am making it up. What they focused on is more tax cuts for the wealthy, not a joke. They are proposal adds another [MONEY] tax cut for millionaires and billionaires. Cuts in funding. Cutting the means by which we fund the [ORG] system, leading the actuary of [ORG] to say if they do it, by [DATE], there'll be no money for [ORG]. And a relentless effort to eliminate, as [PERSON] said, the Affordable Care Act, which provides healthcare coverage for [CARDINAL] people, [CARDINAL] with pre-existing conditions. This is going on at the same time he is already cost [CARDINAL] people their health insurance because their companies have gone bankrupt. It is unconscionable. Instead of focusing on our needs, your needs, he is trying to take your healthcare away. He is literally before [ORG] as I speak to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act, take away that healthcare for [CARDINAL] [NORP]. That is [CARDINAL] [NORP]. Take away federal protections for preexisting conditions, [CARDINAL] [NORP]. And complications from COVID like lung scarring and heart damage could well become the next pre-existing condition. Striking down the Affordable Care Act would toss out the rule that allows our children to be covered on their parents' insurance policy until [DATE]. Take us backward when insurance companies could change a woman more for healthcare than a man for the same procedure, just because she is a woman. Take away [ORG] benefits for seniors. Increase their drug prescription costs. And just as he vowed to terminate as I said earlier the funding for [ORG]. The idea that in [DATE] could put at risk [CARDINAL] [NORP] that rely on a dignified retirement because of [ORG]. And during all this, not once did President [PERSON] call a high-level meeting of [NORP] and [NORP] to [ORG] to resolve these issues. I have served with a lot of presidents, never, no matter how good or bad you thought they were did they fail to try to bring parties together in [ORG] to reach a settlement. You know why? He spent so much time hiding in the bunker in [ORG] or on the bunker of his golf course, playing [CARDINAL] of rounds of golf. And then [DATE], what'd he do? He said, End the discussions. He was not even starting them. No more negotiations. No more negotiations. And now [DATE] he says, Well, I am back. [CARDINAL] thing for sure, [PERSON] shows no urgency to deliver hardworking [NORP], like the family I grew up in. Like all of you. What they need now desperately. For [DATE] since the emergency small business program that your congresspeople voted, for has closed down [DATE] of small business owners in [GPE] and across the country, waiting, hoping, for just a little extra help to be able to stay open. Now we have [CARDINAL], 000 small businesses have been permanently closed. By the way, the largest employers in [GPE] are small businesses. [CARDINAL] more are struggling to hang on. How many more will go under? How many more dreams will be extinguished because of the selfishness of this President and the [NORP] leaders in [ORG]? Make no mistake, if you are out of work, if your business is closed, if your child's school was shut down, if you are facing eviction, as [CARDINAL] are, [CARDINAL] [NORP] worry about whether they are going to be able to pay their mortgage [DATE]. None of that seems to matter to [PERSON]. You are a firefighter, police officer, who depends on state and local budgets. He is turned his back on you as well, because they have got to balance their budgets. They are being laid off all over [GPE]. When [PERSON] and I were elected, we inherited the worst recession short of the Great Depression in history. He put me in charge of what is called the Recovery Act. [MONEY]. We passed and needed to get out into the economy within [DATE] to prevent a depression. We did it with [PERCENT] [PERCENT] of waste or fraud. And I was able to see to it that the states in order to keep moving, keep teachers, firefighters, first responders, all employed. I was able to get [MONEY] in aid out to the states. Right here in [GPE], I was able to bring to [MONEY] to keep your economy going. We have that ability now. The [ORG] has already passed a similar piece of legislation. And we started the longest sustained recovery in [NORP] history. But you know what [PERSON] said about help with the states. I am not making this up. He said, Let them go bankrupt. Let them go bankrupt. What in the hell is he talking about? Folks, we are so much better than this. We can turn this crisis into progress. We contain this virus and fully reopen our economy. We make up [PERCENT] of the world's population and we have [PERCENT] of the world's deaths. If we just follow the science, expand testing and tracing, social distance, washing our hands, implementing nationwide mask mandates. Do not politicize the race for a vaccine, Mr. President. Just have a plan for safe and equitable distribution. On the economy, bring the [ORG] back together to pass real relief to help people who've lost their unemployment checks as well. And then implement a comprehensive agenda that I have laid out to make bold investments so we can build back better. He keeps talking about the [NORP]. Some [NORP], a lot of them are acknowledging and supporting me, but a lot of them also are talking about, Well, [PERSON]'s going to spend all this money. Well, guess what? The independent analysis put out by [ORG], a Wall Street firm did a detailed analysis of my recovery plan and the President's. And here is what they said, it is off of Wall Street, that my plan will create [CARDINAL] jobs in [DATE]. [CARDINAL] more jobs than the President's plan. And [MONEY] more in economic growth than the President's plan. [NORP] know how to get things done. Here is how my plan works. It is not going to raise [MONEY] in tax for anyone making [MONEY], 000 a year. Not a penny. And how am I going to pay for all this? I am going to ask the big corporations and the wealthy to start paying their fair share. You realize that the Fortune [CARDINAL] companies, [CARDINAL] of them making [MONEY], do not pay [MONEY] in taxes. It is wrong. [PERSON] paying $[MONEY] in taxes? Come on. The money we raise by eliminating the [MONEY] of his [MONEY] tax cut that affects the super wealthy and corporations, we are going to invest in working people. We are going to grow the middle class to make sure everyone's included on the deal. The kinds of investment that will stimulate the economy, including industries like tourism and hospitality. To get back to full employment fast and help build back better than before. It means the analysis shows creating [CARDINAL] of good paying union jobs. Manufacturing and technology. Making sure our future is made in [GPE]. We and the President in [ORG] gives out [MONEY] in contracts per year. Well guess what? While I am President, it is going to go to no outfit that does not make it in [GPE], the whole thing, and sell it in [GPE]. I mean it. And infrastructure. Building roads, bridges, highways, ports, airports, and clean energy. Upgrading [CARDINAL] buildings and weatherizing, [CARDINAL] homes, creating [CARDINAL] good paying jobs in the process. Making the climate safer, saving [CARDINAL] of barrels of oil. We will deal with climate change by creating [CARDINAL] of union jobs that build a climate resilience of our cities and our towns fighting back stronger, more frequent wildfires. Beating heat waves, droughts, hurricanes, and floods. By the way, did you hear what the President said about hurricanes [DATE]? He was told about how they are coming across the warm water in the Atlantic and the closer they get to the shore, the worse they get. You know what he said, [PERSON]? He said, Maybe we should drop an atomic weapon on them and blow them up. As we say in my religion, Bless me father for I have sinned. What is going on here? Under my plan, small business come out the other side of this crisis with access to capital and the ability to deal with their debts. We are going to get [MONEY] in new capital, especially for minority owned businesses and small businesses. We are going to make [MONEY] in low-interest loans available to these businesses, creating jobs, increasing economic growth and increasing incomes. A $[MONEY] minimum wage. I am dreaming here. But a $[MONEY] minimum wage for our essential workers. We are not just going to praise you, we are going to pay you with a good wage. Ensure you have strong benefits. We will ease the burden of the major cost in your life. We will build the Affordable Care Act, writing knew health insurance options, not for-profit public options, which give private insurers a real competitor. We are going to increase subsidies for premiums and lower your costs. Increase plans that will lower deductibles and lower out of pocket expenses. And we are going to take on the pharmaceutical industry with a plan that will slash costs of prescription drugs by [PERCENT]. The reason I am not going to more detail, you have been out here a long time, let us give me [CARDINAL] example. If in fact [ORG] is able to negotiate for all the drugs they buy and say you are not going to be able to sell them to them unless you pay the price we are suggesting, that would drop by [PERCENT] the cost the cost of drugs. We will also make high quality childcare available and accessible. We will work with the states to ensure that every three, [DATE] will get access to free, high quality preschool. Not, not, not daycare. We are going to make sure low and middle income families never have to spend [PERCENT] 7% of their income to care for young children. Because if we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burdens that created the care for families that are caring for raising a child and an aging loved one. Look at the professional caregivers out there, home health care workers, childcare workers, who are more often women. Women of color immigrants, are too often underpaid, under seen and undervalued. That is why my Build Back Better plan will elevate the compensation, benefits and dignity of caregiving workers and early childhood educators. We are also going to triple the funding for Title I schools like the one behind me here, which served high number of children from low-income families. We are going to make [DATE] of public college and universities tuition free for any family that makes [MONEY] a year. We are going to make community college and job training programs free for all hardworking [NORP] that qualify. And if you are buying your first home, we are going to provide a [MONEY] tax credit to help you get there. We are going to protect [ORG]. Increase benefits for [CARDINAL] of seniors. Look, I am not going to lay it out, but go to joebiden.com. Go to [ORG], look it up. We pay for all this and we grow the economy at the same time. The fact is, President of [GPE] can only see the world from [FAC]. He thinks Wall Street built this country and CEOs. I see the world from where I grew up in [GPE], [GPE] and [GPE]. Communities like some that you live in. I know the middle-class working people built this country. The measure of economic success has been what our families are talking about around the kitchen table. Are you able to look your kid in the eye and say, Honey, it is going to be okay? How many times do you know somebody [TIME] I had to say, look, I know those tires are bald, but you got to ride on them for [QUANTITY]. We just do not have the money. We just cannot do it now. Who is going to tell her she cannot go back to school because we cannot continue to borrow the money to keep her in that community college? There was a discussion that took place around my table and I am sure yours as well. But if we are going to get anything done, we got to come together. I made a speech I worked really, really hard on and thought really hard about before I made it in [GPE], [GPE], on the battlefield [DATE]. I said at that time that we are facing a crisis, not unlike we did after Gettysburg. I said there that I am running as a proud [NORP], but I am going to govern as an [NORP] president. The work is hard for those who do not support me as those who do, because after all this country has been through, after all that [GPE] has accomplished, after all the years, we stood as a beacon of light to the world we cannot be that here and now, in [DATE], we allow the government, the government of the people, by the people, and for the people, to perish from this earth. Folks, we have it our hands. And I made this in the bottom of heart, we have in our hands the ultimate power. And what is the ultimate power in a democracy? The power to vote. Here in [GPE], the best thing you can do is vote early and return your ballot quickly. Ballots here in [GPE] were mailed [DATE], on [DATE]. You can return your ballot by mail. You can drop it off at a drop box or vote in person during the early vote or on [DATE]. But just make a plan. Seriously, go to iwillvote.com/nv. Make a plan. Do not risk any delays, return that mail and ballot as soon as you can. Make sure your voice is heard. We can be better than what we have seen. We can be what we are at our best, [GPE]. I am confident we can bring [NORP] and [NORP] together again with him gone. Folks, conclude by saying there has never, ever, ever been anything [GPE] has been unable to accomplish when we have done it together. Never, never, never. So folks let us stand up and vote and take back this country now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsjoebidenoutlinessocialclimatespendingbillspeechtranscript", "text": "Good [TIME]. [DATE] I am pleased to announce that after [DATE] of tough and thoughtful negotiations, I think we have an historic, I know we have historic economic framework. It is a framework that will create [CARDINAL] of jobs, grow the economy, invest in our nation and our people. Turn the climate crisis into an opportunity and put us in a path not only to compete, but to win the economic competition for [DATE] against [GPE] and every other major country in the world. It is fiscally responsible, it is fully paid for. [CARDINAL] Nobel Prize winners and economics have said it will lower the inflationary pressures on the economy. And over [DATE], it will not add to the deficit at all. It will actually reduce the deficit, according to the economists. I want to thank my colleagues in the [ORG] for their leadership. We spent [TIME], and [DATE], and [TIME] over [DATE] and [DATE] working on this. No one got everything they wanted, including me. But that is what compromise is. That is consensus. And that is what I ran on. I have long said compromise and consensus are the only way to get big things done in a democracy. Important things done for the country. I know it is hard. I know how deeply people feel about the things that they fight for. But this framework includes historic investments in our nation and in our people. Any single element of this framework would fundamentally be viewed as a fundamental change in [GPE]. Taken together, they are truly consequential. I will have more to say after I return from the critical meetings in Europe [DATE], but for now let me lay out a few points. First we face, and I apologize for saying this again, we face an inflection point as a nation. For most of [DATE] we led the world by a significant margin because we invested in our people. Not only in our roads, and in our highways, and in our bridges, but in our people. In our families. We did not just build an interstate highway system, we built a highway to the sky. We invested to win the Space Race, and we won. We were also among the first to provide access to free education for all [NORP], beginning back in [DATE]. That decision alone to invest in our children and their families was a major part of why we were able to lead the world for much of [DATE]. But somewhere along the way we stopped investing in ourselves, investing in people. [GPE] is still the largest economy in the world. We still own the most productive workers and the most innovative minds in the world. But we risk losing our edge as a nation. Our infrastructure used to be rated the best in the world. [DATE], according to [ORG], we ranked 13th in the world. We used to lead the world in educational achievement. Now [ORG] ranks [GPE] 35th out of the [CARDINAL] major countries when it comes to investing in early childhood education and care. And we know how where children start impacts significantly in how they will finish. We cannot be competitive in the [DATE] global economy if we continue this slide. That is what I have said all along. We need to build [GPE] from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down with the trickle-down economics that is always failed us. I cannot think of a single time when the middle class has done well that the wealthy have not done very well. I can think of many times, including now, when the wealthy, the super wealthy do very well, and the middle class do not do well. That is why I proposed the investments congress is now considering in [CARDINAL] critical pieces of legislation. Positions I ran on as president, positions I announced when I laid out in a joint session of [ORG] what my economic agenda was. These are not about left versus right, or moderate versus progressive, or anything else that pits [NORP] against one another. This is about competitiveness versus complacency. Competitiveness versus complacency. It is about expanding opportunity, not opportunity denied. It is about leading the world or letting the world pass us by. [DATE], with my democratic colleagues, we have a framework for my Build Back Better Initiative. And here is how it will fundamentally change the lives of [CARDINAL] of people for the better. [CARDINAL] of you are in the so-called Sandwich Generation, who feel financially squeezed by raising a child and caring for an aging parent. [CARDINAL] 000 seniors in [GPE], and people with disabilities, have applied for [ORG], and they are on a waiting list right now to get home care. They need some help. They do not have be kicked out of their homes, but they need a little help getting around. Having their meals made occasionally for them. They do not want to put them in nursing homes. Not because of the cost, but because it is a matter of dignity. They want to stay in their homes. But it is hard. You are just looking for an answer so your parents can keep living independently with dignity. For [CARDINAL] of families in [GPE] this, this issue, is the most important issue they are facing. It is personal. So here is what we are going to do. We are going to expand services for seniors so families can get help from well-trained, well-paid professionals to help them take care of their parents at home. To cook meals for them, to get their groceries for them, to help them get around, to help them live in their own home with the dignity they deserve to be afforded. Quite frankly, what we found is that this is more popular, or as popular as anything else we are proposing. Because the [NORP] people understand the need. It is a matter of dignity and pride for our parents. [DATE], we ranked number [CARDINAL] among the advanced economies in the world as a share of women working. Know where we are [DATE]? We rank 23rd. 23rd. [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL]. Once again our competitors are investing and we are standing still. [DATE] there are [CARDINAL] women in [GPE] not working [DATE] simply because they cannot afford childcare. Typical family spends [MONEY] 000 a year on childcare, some states it is $[MONEY], [MONEY] a year per-child. We are going to make sure nearly all families earning [MONEY], 000 a year will pay [PERCENT] of their income for childcare. And for a family making [MONEY] a year, that will save them [MONEY][MONEY] 000 in childcare. This is a fundamental game-changer for families and for our economy. As more parents, especially women, can get back to work and work in the workforce. I am looking at a lot of significant press people in front of me. A lot of them are working, working mothers. They know what it costs. I remember when I got to the [ORG], I lost my wife and daughter in an accident. My [CARDINAL] boys. I started commuting [QUANTITY] a day because I had my mom and my dad and my brother and my sister to help me take care of my kids because I could not afford childcare. And I was getting a serious salary, $[MONEY], 000 a year. We have also extended the historic middle class tax cut. That is what I call it, middle class tax cut for parents. That is the expanded child tax credit we passed through the American Rescue Plan. What that means is, for folks at home, they are getting $[MONEY] a month for every child [DATE], $[MONEY] for every child [DATE]. We are extending that for [DATE]. The money is already a life-changer for so many working families. This will help cut child poverty in [CARDINAL] [DATE], according to experts. But that is not all it does, it changes the whole dynamic for working parents. In the past if you paid taxes and had a good income you could deduct, under the tax code, $[MONEY], [MONEY] per-child from the taxes you owed. But how many families do you know are cashier or waiters, healthcare workers, who never out the benefit of the full tax credit because they did not have that much to deduct? And it was not refundable. So it either came off your tax bill or you did not get full credit. Why should, if somebody making $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] a year, or [MONEY] or $200, 000 a year, get to write it off their taxes? And the people who need the help even more, they do not have that much tax to pay. They do not get the benefit, and they have the same cost of raising their children. [PERCENT] of those left out were working parents who just did not make enough money. That is why in the American Rescue Plan we did not just expand the amount of the middle class tax cut, we also made it refundable. This framework will make it permanently refundable, making sure the families who need it get a full credit for it, in addition to those who are already getting full credit. They are going to make sure that every [DATE] child in [GPE] go to high-quality preschool. That is part of the legislation I just brought up to the [ORG]. Studies show that when we put [DATE] in school, school, not daycare, school, we increase by [PERCENT] the chance that that child, no matter what their background, we will be able to earn a college degree. As my wife, [PERSON], who is in the back here always says, any country that out-educates us is going to out-compete us. We can finally take us from [DATE] to [DATE] of universal education in [GPE]. We also make investments in higher education, by increasing Pell Grants to help students from lower-income families attend community college and [DATE] schools. And we invest in historically black universities, colleges, universities, HBCUs, minority-serving institutions and tribal colleges, to make sure every young student has a shot at a good-paying job in the future. This framework extends tax credits to lower premiums for folks who are in the Affordable Care Act for [DATE]. For [CARDINAL] folks in the [CARDINAL] states that have not expanded [ORG], all the rest have, this framework will enable you to get affordable coverage. And [ORG] will now cover the cost of hearing aids and hearing checkups. This framework also makes the most significant investment to deal with the climate crisis ever, ever happened. Beyond any other advanced nation in the world, [QUANTITY] of emission reductions, [QUANTITY] bigger on climate than any bill that has ever passed before, and enough to position us for a [PERCENT] emission reductions by [DATE]. And we will do it in ways that grow the domestic industries, create good-paying union jobs, address long-standing environmental injustices as well. Tax credit to help people do things like weatherize their homes so they lose less energy. Install solar panels and develop clean energy products, and help businesses produce more clean energy. And when paired with the bipartisan infrastructure bill, we will truly transform this nation. Historic investments in passenger rail. I know everybody says, oh, [SPEAKER]'s a rail guy. That is true. But passenger rail and freight rail and public transit, it is going to take [CARDINAL] of vehicles off the road, saving [CARDINAL] of barrels of oil. Everybody knows, all the studies show, if you can get from point A to point B on electric rail, you will not drive your car. You will take the rail service. We also learned that in most major cities in [GPE], minority populations, the jobs they used to have in town, they are now out of town. [PERCENT] of the folks, they do not have vehicles. So they need to have a means to get out of town to their jobs, to be on time. This will do that, like it did for [GPE]. [PERCENT] of the [CARDINAL] 000 school buses in [GPE] run on diesel. [DATE] [CARDINAL] children and [CARDINAL] of bus drivers breathe polluted air on the way to and from school from the diesel exhaust. We are going to replace [CARDINAL] of these with electric school buses that have big batteries underneath, and that are good for the climate. I went down to one of the manufacturing facilities, saw them, got in one, drive them. They do not expend any, they do not expend any pollution into the air. We will build out the first ever national network of [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] electric vehicle charging stations all across the country. So when you buy an electric vehicle, and you get credit for buying it, you buy electric vehicle, you go all the way across [GPE] on a single tank of gas, figuratively speaking. It is not gas, you plug it in. [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] of them, these stations along the way. We are going to get off the sidelines on manufacturing solar panels and wind farms and electric vehicles, with targeted manufacturing credits. You manufacture, you get a credit for doing it. These will help grow the supply chains in communities too often left behind. And we are going to reward countries for paying good wages, for companies I should say, for good wages and for sourcing their materials from here in [GPE]. That means [CARDINAL] of panels and turbines, doubling the number of electric vehicles we have on the road within [DATE]. We will be able to sell and export these products and technologies to the rest of the world, and creating [CARDINAL] more jobs because we are, once again, going to be the innovators. We will also make historic investments in environmental cleanup and remediation. That means putting people to work in good-paying jobs at prevailing wage. Capping [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] of abandoned wells and gas wells, oil and gas wells, that need to be capped because they are leaking things that hurt the air. Putting a stop to the methane leaks and in the pipelines, protecting the health of our communities, it is a big deal. And we will build up our resilience for the next super storm, drought, wildfires, and hurricanes that represent a blinking code red for [GPE] and the world. [DATE] alone, these types of extreme weather events you have all been covering, and you have all witnessed, and some of you have been caught in the middle of, have caused [MONEY] in damage to [GPE] within [DATE]. [MONEY]. And we are not spending any money to deal with this? This is costing us significantly. I met in [GPE], I met an [ORG] electrical worker who climbs up in those power lines in the middle of the storm to try to put transformers in to keep the lights on when storms hit. He calls himself a [PERCENT] union guy. His job's dangerous. As he said, I quote, I do not want my kids growing up in a world where the threat of climate change hangs over their heads. End of quote. Folks, we all have that obligation. That obligation to our children and to our grandchildren. The bipartisan infrastructure bill was also the most significant investment since we built the interstate highway system and won the space race [DATE]. This is about rebuilding the arteries of our economy. Across the country now there are [CARDINAL] bridges, and [QUANTITY] of roads, that are in poor condition. Some of the bridges you do not even take a chance of going across, they have shut down. They cannot be built back to the same standard because the weather's not going to get a lot better. We just got to keep it from getting a heck of a lot worse. We have to build back better and stronger. No one should have to hold their breath as they cross a rundown bridge or a dangerous intersection in their hometown. We are going to put hard-working [NORP] on the job to bring our infrastructure up to speed. Good union jobs at prevailing wages. Jobs you can raise the family on. And my dad would say, you could have a little breathing room. Jobs that cannot be outsourced. Jobs replacing lead water pipes so families can drink clean water, improving the health of our children and putting plumbers and pipe-fitters to work. Jobs laying [QUANTITY] of transmission lines to build a modern energy grid. Jobs making a high-speed internet affordable and available everywhere, in rural and urban [GPE]. Particularly including [PERCENT] of rural [GPE] that goes without it right now. This pandemic has made clear the need for affordable and available high-speed internet. The idea of a parent having to put their kids in the car for virtual learning, drive and sit in the [ORG]'s parking lot so the child can access the internet when school is taught virtually, is not only unnecessary, it is just wrong. It is wrong. As I said before, these plans are fiscally responsible. They are fully paid for. They do not add [MONEY] to the deficit. They do not raise taxes on anyone making [MONEY], 000 a year. In fact, they reduced the deficit, here is how; I do not want to punish anyone's success, I am a capitalist. I want everyone to be able to, if they want to be a millionaire or billionaire, to be able to seek their goal. But all I am asking is, pay your fair share. Pay your fair share. Pay your fair share. And right now, many are paying virtually nothing. [DATE] the [CARDINAL] most profitable corporations in [GPE], [CARDINAL] of them, paid [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], in federal income tax on [MONEY] in profit. If they report big profits to their shareholders, they should be paying taxes. It is that simple. That is why the Build Back Better framework will have a [PERCENT] minimum on the largest corporations, a minimum tax of [PERCENT]. [PERCENT] of the wealthiest [NORP] evade, it is estimated by the experts, [MONEY] a year in federal taxes. That is wrong. We are going to change that. I want to emphasize what I said from the beginning. Under my plans, if you earn [MONEY], 000, you will not pay [MONEY] more in federal taxes. Period. In fact, these bills continue cutting taxes for middle class. For childcare, for healthcare, so much more. Let me close with this. For much too long, working people of this nation in the middle class of this country have been dealt out of the [NORP] deal. It is time to deal them back in. I ran for president saying it was time to reduce the burden on the middle class. To rebuild the backbone of this nation, working people and the middle class. I could not have been any clearer from the very moment I announced my candidacy. That is why I wrote these bills in the first place, and took them to the people. I campaigned on them, and the [NORP] people spoke. This agenda, the agenda that is in these bills, is what [CARDINAL] [NORP] voted for. More people voted than any time in [NORP] history. That is what they voted for. Their voices deserve to be heard, not denied, or worse ignored. Because here is what I know; we make these investments, there will be no stopping the [NORP] people or [GPE]. We will own the future. I have long said it is never been a good bet to bet against the [NORP] people. I have said that to foreign leaders, as well as everyone here in this country. Which means it is always a good bet to bet on the [NORP] people, just give them [CARDINAL] a chance. And that is what we are doing. That is what these plans do. They are about betting on [GPE], about believing in [GPE], about believing in the capacity of the [NORP] people. If you look at the history of the journey of this nation, what becomes crystal clear is this, I will say it again: given [CARDINAL] a chance, the [NORP] people have never, ever, ever, ever let the country down. So let us get this done. God bless you all, and may God protect your troops, and I will see you in [GPE] and in [GPE]. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}

Well, thank you very much and I am thrilled to be back with the hardworking, God-fearing, card-carrying patriots of the [ORG]. Thank you very much, everybody. As a candidate in [DATE], I promised you that I would save your Second Amendment from absolute oblation, that is where it was going, and as your president, that is exactly what I did. We saved our Second Amendment and we are going to save it for a long time to come. It is under siege, but we are going to save it for a long time to come. Forever, as far as I am concerned, forever, and thank you very much. I was proud to be the most pro-gun, [ORG] president you have ever had in [ORG], I think that is been acknowledged, and with your support in [DATE], I will be your loyal friend and fearless champion once again as the 47th president of [GPE]. We have to remember in [DATE], we won, we won the first time, and we did better the second time, got a lot more votes. A lot of bad things happened, though, did not they, huh? A lot of bad things happened. I want to thank [PERSON] and [PERSON] for their leadership, as well as all of the people that work with them, the [ORG] members who make up this incredible organization. It is really a tremendous force for freedom, that is what it is, and I am very proud to be here. Thanks as well to Congressman [PERSON] and his incredible wife, [PERSON]. Where is [PERSON]? He is around here someplace. Where is [PERSON]? Also, with them came along [PERSON]. Do you know [PERSON] is a wrestler, [CARDINAL]-time All-American? If anybody's into sports, even a little bit, [CARDINAL]-time All-American's good. [PERSON] was a great wrestler, a lot of people do not know that. His daughter-in-law, [PERSON], she is about to have a baby. I said, When is the baby coming? She said, It could be [DATE] or [DATE]. I said, What are you doing here? But he is a spectacular congressman, politician, and person, and so I just want to thank [PERSON] and the whole family, and [PERSON], thank you very much for being here. Somebody that I believe is going to be and a friend of [PERSON], and it is going to be your next senator from the great state of [GPE], which I love so much, [PERSON]. Where is [PERSON]? [PERSON]? [PERSON]. Hi, [PERSON]. He is so popular now, he is unopposed. We like it that way, do not we? Thank you very much, [PERSON]. You are doing fantastically well. [GPE] Lieutenant Governor [PERSON], thank you very much. Thank you very much. [PERSON], where is [PERSON]? [PERSON], thank you very much. Also, Attorney General [PERSON]. [PERSON], where is [PERSON]? He is someplace here, I saw him. It is a big crowd, [PERSON], that is a big crowd. Thank you very much. Great job, [PERSON], doing a great job. For [DATE], all of us here [DATE] have been engaged in an epic struggle against the corrupt forces and communist maniacs, and they are all over the place, that are absolutely trying to destroy our country. They want to take away your guns while throwing open the jailhouse doors and releasing bloodthirsty criminals into your communities. They want to abolish your borders and impoverish your families while spending your money on endless and very, very stupid foreign wars. They want to demonize patriots and persecute [NORP] while pushing the transgender cult on your children, children who turn [DATE] and they say, Who did this to me? Who did this to me? How did you let this happen? They want to weaponize and interfere with our elections through the use of the [ORG], the [ORG], and local attorney generals and district attorneys. That is happening to me, but we are doing very well, thank you. It is actually called election interference, that is all they want to do. I will tell you what, if I were not running, which is not going to happen, or if I was doing badly in the polls, and we are not going to let that happen either, we are killing them in the polls, are you seeing the numbers? They would not be doing anything. They'd be after somebody else. They would not be talking. But we are going to show you some of the polls in a little while, you are going to be amazed. We really made a lot of progress over [DATE]. We put it into high gear, like we did for [DATE] when this country had no problems, and then [ORG] came in and we got it back. When you think about it, it was amazing. We actually left it with a stock market that was higher than just pre-COVID coming in. It was an amazing job that we did. We built it twice, but there was nothing like it. There was nothing like it. What we did in [DATE] were really monumental, rebuilt our military, largest tax cuts in history, largest regulation cuts in history, the creation of [ORG], that was a big deal, that was a big deal, and so many other things. Even right to try, I hope nobody needs it, right to try, where you can use this advanced medical treatments that will not be approved for [DATE] by the [ORG], but we got them to move a lot faster, I will tell you, on everything, but will not be approved by the [ORG] for [DATE], and we have saved [CARDINAL] and thousands of lives with right to try. But we did a lot, we did a lot. [DATE] is [DATE] that we will defeat these nation-wrecking globalists, [NORP], RINOs, and tyrants once and for all. The RINOs are in there. In many ways, the RINOs are worse because you do not know where they are coming from. You say, Oh, that is a RINO, we do not like that one. At least with the [NORP], you know where they are coming from and that is not a good place, is it? If you put me back in [FAC], their reign is over and [GPE] will be a free nation once again. I promise you this, with me at [FAC], no one will lay a finger on your firearms, just as took place for [DATE] when I was your president, I will uphold those glorious words, Shall not be infringed. Do you know those words? I think you know those words. You know those words? Every pledge I made to you as a candidate in [DATE], I fulfilled as your president. I appointed [CARDINAL] federal judges to fill the bench with pro- Constitution warriors who interpret the law as written. We have great judges, a lot of great justices, [CARDINAL], a record. I faced down vile attacks from the radical left to confirm [CARDINAL] great [ORG] justices, you know who they are, [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], all outstanding people. They do not help me much, I have got to tell you that, they vote against me too much, but one of those little things in life, right? But they are outstanding people and great scholars, brilliant, and they have done a very good job. I always say, Except for me, they have done a very good job. Standing before you like, Show your tax returns, that was not supposed to happen, right? Show you tax returns, I thought that was not supposed to happen. By the way, I showed them, and you know what happened? Nothing. They said, This guy made a lot of money. Standing before you at [ORG] in [DATE], I revoked [GPE]'s signature from the globalist [ORG], which was a disaster. I never surrendered to the globalist left. I always put our term [ORG], very simple, [GPE] First. I canceled [PERSON] corrupt use of [ORG] data to deny [NORP] their gun rights without due process of law. You know that very well in this auditorium, I fought [PERSON]'s unconstitutional effort to ban 3D-printed guns. I stood up for our hunters, fishers, and sportsmen like no other president has ever done before, opening up [QUANTITY] of federal land and rolling back [PERSON]'s assaults on hunting, fishing, trapping, and on ammunition itself. When the radical left [NORP] tried to use COVID to shut down gun sales during the [GPE] virus pandemic, I proudly designated gun and ammunition retailers as critical infrastructure. Do you remember that? Little things like that. It saved all of them, a lot of them are in the room with us [DATE]. My administration also petitioned [ORG] to overturn [GPE] unconstitutional, so many unconstitutional things are taking place in these [NORP]-run cities, but it was an unconstitutional ban on transporting handguns outside of the home, and in a landmark case [DATE], the court affirmed that the right to self-defense does not end when you step outside the front door of your house. We did all of this and we did so much more working now and going to finish everything that we started. We finished a lot it already in [DATE], but we have things to do and we have things to finish and we are going to get that done. We are going to have a big, big, successful election coming up. We are going to take back that beautiful, gorgeous [ORG]. In [DATE] of my new term, I will stop [PERSON] war on lawful gun owners. It is a war, what they are doing is crazy, so many things are crazy. Let us say no borders, high taxes, everything they do. I made a speech recently and I used this term, and I did not even know we were using it, but I used it, [DATE] is like [DATE]. We want no borders. No, no, no, you have got to have borders. We want want no walls. No, no, you got to have walls. Everything is like the opposite. This is [DATE], right? We want high taxes. No, no, we want to keep our taxes low. We want no guns. No, no, we want people to be able to protect themselves and also enjoy it as entertainment and go out and hunt and do the things that you want to do. It is almost like [DATE]. Everything that they do is like, We want to have a weak military. We want our military to be woke.. We rebuilt the entire [GPE] military. We had planes that were [DATE]. We built brand new, beautiful jets. We had planes where the grandfathers were flying the same plane as the grandson, but we rebuilt our entire military. I hate to say this, we gave [MONEY] of it to the [ORG] in [GPE], in probably the most embarrassing, single moment in the history of our country, which I believe led to [GPE] going in. They would've never done that with us, but I believe it led to that and led to a lot of bad things. That was the most embarrassing period of time, I think in our nation's history. Not only that, the soldiers killed, [CARDINAL] killed, many just horribly, horribly wounded, hurt, no arms, no legs, faces were just so badly hurt and we left a lot of people there too. And then we gave up [FAC], a big airbase, [TIME] from where [GPE] makes its nuclear weapons. You should have never given that up, and I call it a surrender. We actually surrendered. We were in great shape. If you look back on that history, you are going to see something that was interesting. I dealt with [PERSON]. [PERSON] was the leader of the [ORG], and I took a lot of heat from all of those fake news people back there, and they said, Why do you call [PERSON]? [PERSON] is the leader of the [ORG]. They are the ones that we are fighting and fighting hard.. And I related to [PERSON]. I say, Well, [PERSON], the great bank robber, great outlaw.. They say, Why do you always rob banks, [PERSON]?. He said, Because that is where the money is.. So when I dealt with [PERSON], he is the one that was shooting our young soldiers and others with snipers and lots of other things, and I said, [PERSON], you cannot do that. You cannot do that., over the phone. You do that, you are going to suffer like nobody's ever suffered. Your whole community is going to be terrible. We will hit you harder than anybody's ever been hit.. He said, Your excellency, why, but why do you send me a picture of my home?. I said, [PERSON], you are going to have to figure that one out for yourself.. But you know what? We did not lose [CARDINAL] soldier in [DATE]. Now think of it, not [CARDINAL] soldier was even shot at. They were at bay and we were going to get out with pride and with dignity. We were going to take all of our equipment out. I told the generals, I want every screw. I want every bolt. I want every tank. I want every plane. I want every helicopter. I want everything out. Sir, can we leave the hangers?, you know those big canvas, covered hangers? Nope. They come out general.. Sir, I think it would be a lot easier to leave the equipment behind.. This was [PERSON]. That is when I realized he is a fool. I said, So you mean to tell me, General, that if we have a [MONEY] airplane sitting there, you want to leave that and you think that is a good thing?. Leave the airplane, leave the helicopters, which they did leave all of this very expensive We could just fill it up with a little jet fuel and fly it to [GPE] or fly it home. Yes, sir. I think it would be a good idea to leave it.. That is where these ideas came from. Can you imagine? We left [MONEY] worth of equipment in [GPE] and I just read a report [DATE] that they are about the second-largest seller of arms in the whole world. We sell more than they do, a little bit, but they are the second largest. Can you imagine that they are Because they do not need [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] rifles? We left behind, talking about guns, [ORG], [CARDINAL] 000 guns and rifles, some of them the finest in the world. Some of them, even are people right up here that are so wealthy, I know them. They wish they could afford guns like we left behind for the [ORG]. Think of it, [CARDINAL], 000, [CARDINAL] 000 vehicles. Many of them armor plated, costing [MONEY] apiece. We left it all behind like a bunch of fools. We are led by stupid people, and let me tell you, we have never been in such danger in our life. I believe it is the most dangerous time in the history of our country, because of the power of weaponry and I am not talking about rifles now. You know what I am talking about. The N word. Cannot use the N word. [CARDINAL] N words you cannot use. You cannot use the nuclear word. The power of these weapons is so And I would never talk about it. I did not talk about it, and now it is talked about [DATE], including by [PERSON]. He goes, You know we are a great nuclear power.. He says that publicly now. He never said that when I was here, because you do not talk about it. It is too destructive. You do not talk about it. Now, they are talking about it all the time and we have somebody that has no idea what it is. We have never been in such danger. Because of our leadership, we have never been in such danger as we are right now. I will take [PERSON]'s executive order directing the federal government to target the firearms industry, and I will rip it up and throw it out on [DATE]. That'll be the first thing I do. I will also get energy started. We are energy independent, soon to be energy dominant. I will get that going quickly. You will see. You will see your gasoline and your heating bills and your cooling bills and every other bill, you will see them plummet and you will see inflation start to go away. I will eliminate the [PERSON] ATFs ridiculous pistol brace rule, which orders law-abiding citizens to register or surrender guns with stabilizing braces. Right? Does everybody like that or should I forget about it? I do not know. They wanted me to put that in. I guess some people are happy with it. I do not know. To restore our Second Amendment, we will pass legislation protecting the absolute right to self-defense with federal penalties for prosecutorial abuse, like we saw just recently in [GPE]. You saw that? Where a man was trying to defend himself and they want to put him in jail for the rest of his life, and I will ask [ORG] to send a bill to my desk delivering national concealed carry reciprocity. You want protection. Just like your driver's license or your marriage license, your Second Amendment must apply across state lines. It will. We will get it done pretty quickly too. The [PERSON] gun control agenda is part and parcel of the left wing crusade to organize government against law-abiding citizens, while letting criminals roam free. They are all over the place. I have never seen anything like it. You are afraid to walk through one of these [NORP] cities. You go out for a loaf of bread, you end up getting shot. As president, I will end the weaponization of our government, including the [ORG], the [ORG], and the [ORG]. They have weaponized our country. I will dismantle and destroy the deep state. We made a big progress, and that includes the gun grabbing bureaucrats who are persecuting gun owners and manufacturers [DATE]. You people are getting persecuted by these left wing maniacs. No longer will government target the left's political enemies. Instead, we will once again target violent criminals. I want to go after the criminals. These are mentally deranged or bad people, and we have to go after them and stop worrying about somebody that will never hurt anybody with a gun, just wants the gun for protection or whatever. We will get them behind bars and we will keep them behind bars. They do not even Now in [GPE], we have a district attorney. You can kill somebody and you do not even have to put up bail. They are out [TIME], [TIME]. It is insane and that is true with many different cities. I do not even know. You talk about [DATE]. I do not even know who could think Who would think that this is good? Murderers, killers, violent animals are released onto the streets immediately. They do not even spend time in jail. The first duty of government is to protect its citizens. As an example, when you see these gangs of [CARDINAL] of young, usually young people, go and attack an apartment store, department store in [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE], and they are running by the [CARDINAL] and they are running out carrying refrigerators and carrying air conditioners and big stuff, big, little, everything, fur coats, non-fur coat, everything they are carrying. They empty out the stores and we Our police are incredible, but they are not allowed to do their job. They want to do their job so badly. They are standing there, they are shaking. They want to do their job, be so easy to do, but they are not allowed to do their job, because of these radical lunatics we have thinking they are doing the right thing. I do not even think they do think they are doing the right thing. The politically incorrect truth, that no one on the left wants to admit, is that violent crime is rarely committed by legal gun owners. It is committed by a brutal class of hardened repeat criminals. That is who is doing it. In [GPE], and who would've thought [GPE], one of the most beautiful cities in the world. In [GPE], murder suspects have an average of [CARDINAL] prior arrests and [CARDINAL] felony arrests. Think of that one. In [GPE] shooting Suspects have an average of [CARDINAL] prior arrests and [CARDINAL] criminal charges. In [GPE], a place that I am very familiar with, [DATE]. When I saw tents going up, I had them take them down immediately. Immediately. You cannot do that on these incredible parks and these incredible monuments. They were putting tents up and I take them down immediately, because you can do that much easier than when you have [CARDINAL]. You have to see what is happened to [GPE] since I have left. It is horrible. Beautiful lawns with tents all over. No respect for our country, no respect for anything. But in [GPE], [PERCENT] of all violent crime, and there is a lot of it involving guns, is concentrated among a group of [CARDINAL] chronic law-breakers. Think of that. With most suspects arrested [CARDINAL] times, at least, before being involved in a murder. They ultimately end up in a murder and then they end up getting [DATE] and sometimes less, and sometimes they are not even prosecuted. The only one they want to prosecute is [PERSON]. Let us get [PERSON]. Let us get that son of a bitch. Let us get him. It is unbelievable, actually. These people are sick. They are lunatics. This career criminal class cares nothing about gun laws in [GPE]. [PERCENT] of prison inmates, who used a gun, bought it at a store. So all of the gun owners in this room, a lot of them Who is a gun owner? Who is a gun owner, first of all? Let us go differently. Is there anybody in the room who does not own a gun? Raise your hand if you have the courage. Okay, and how many people own gun stores and sell guns? How many people in the room? Okay, good, good. That is all good, good, good business. That is good. But let us be very clear, the issue is not too many guns. The issue is too many thugs, hoodlums and savage criminals on our street. That is really what the issue is. Instead of getting these dangerous killers into jail, we have radical DAs and attorney generals, prosecutors all across this country, subverting the law to attack conservative people and religious people, [NORP], [NORP]. The very same raging, radical left, lunatic attorney general that is coming after me in [GPE] is also waging war on the [ORG], shamefully trying to destroy this legendary organization that is been an [NORP] institution since [DATE]. You know when the [ORG] endorsed me in [DATE], for the [DATE] campaign, it was fairly early, and I do have [CARDINAL] sons who are really good shots. I do not know if you know. [PERSON] and [PERSON]. If they were golfers, they'd be scratch. Maybe better than scratch, actually. But they are really good. They have been a member of the [ORG] for a long time, and I think maybe that helped, but they endorsed me. That was considered one of the greatest things to do. That it was like getting into [ORG] or getting into [ORG] or getting into a great college. That was a great thing. And they endorsed me very early and it was a great honor. We did a great job. And they better endorse me again, or they are going to have some explaining to do. They will have some explaining to [DATE]. No, I do believe we are in pretty good shape, but when you see the polls in a little while, you can understand that we are in pretty good shape. I have never seen such spirit as there is right now. And part of that, sadly, is because they are doing such a horrible job of running our country, which is really destroying our country, and I think it makes us even more popular to be honest with you. They are doing such a horrible job. What they are doing is destroying our great country. I want to congratulate you for fighting it so bravely, all of the things that have been happening to you. The racist in reverse, ran for office on the promise, I will get [PERSON]. You ever see the commercial? I will get [PERSON]. I am going to get him. Did not know anything about me, she is running for office. I said, Who is that maniac? But I am watching her campaign and a lot of people in the race and get a few people that vote, very few people actually it takes to get in. But she proclaimed, I look forward to going into [ORG] [DATE] suing him and then going home, being very happy. I said, Oh gee, I hope she gets in. I hope she wins. But she announced, What is fueling my soul right now is [PERSON], getting [PERSON]. And she knows nothing about me. So it is not an investigation, you are going through the same thing, it is a persecution. Just like her attacks on the [ORG] and just like the witch hunts against us by the [GPE] DA, the [NORP] DA in [GPE], and the guy I have watching, this guy's central casting, the guy from [GPE] special prosecutor. They say special counsel, I call it a prosecutor, it is much better. They are looking at the boxes hoax. [PERSON] has [CARDINAL] boxes that are unaccounted for. He had many boxes in Chinatown, classified information, many boxes. They got them out of there, but they got caught. It is called obstruction. And they sent them up to [GPE] and they sit up in [GPE] and then it was revealed that he got [MONEY] from the [NORP]. He got [MONEY]. But he has boxes in Chinatown, boxes all over the place. They do not care about that, they only care about [PERSON]. But they are trying to arrest their political opposition, it is really very much like the old [GPE]. They called [NORP] style with elections and with the interference. They are interfering with the election, that is what they are doing. It is going to be hard for them to get away with the kind of corruption they did when they had [ORG] because COVID made a lot of things bad for a lot of people, but they cheated and going to be hard. So now I really believe they are going the prosecutorial way, that is the route. Where they use prosecutors to Do not forget if you are a With me, it is sort of interesting because my numbers have gone way up, you explain this to me. My numbers have gone way up. But other people, because you know me, the truth is the [NORP] public knows me well and they know that is my deal, but they do not know a lot of people running for office. So if you have a young good [NORP] running for office gets a subpoena and then they leak it out to the papers, it is impossible for this guy to win a race. But the good news is we have gone way up. So we have done something that I do not believe has ever done before, and we are going to stay there and we are going to go even higher if we can. I am not sure you can go higher, but we are going to go even higher if you can because we have to save our country. They are not coming after me, they are coming after you and I am just sort of in the way. I am in of these people. And as everybody knows, it is all because we are leading so big in the polls, not only against [NORP], but also against [PERSON]. And if you take a look this [DATE]'s [TIME] consult poll I led the field by [CARDINAL] points with [PERSON] [CARDINAL] [PERSON] [CARDINAL], [PERSON] [CARDINAL]. I hope you gave [PERSON] a good warm approval because he is a nice man, if you want to really know the truth. He is, he is a good man. And I heard it was very rough. It is a big news story. You have made news [DATE]. I do not know what you did, but you made news [DATE] with the introduction you gave. [PERSON], that is another, that is a beauty, she is at [CARDINAL] and [PERSON]'s at [CARDINAL]. I do not think [PERSON]'s going to run, Governor of [GPE]. In a [CARDINAL]-way poll of [GPE] [DATE] it was [PERSON] [CARDINAL] and [PERSON] [PERCENT]. And there was another poll in [GPE] where [PERSON] was at [CARDINAL] and [PERSON] was at [CARDINAL], and that is a [GPE] poll. In [GPE] it is [PERSON], [PERCENT] [PERSON] [CARDINAL], [PERSON] [CARDINAL], [PERSON] [CARDINAL]. The only way we can lose is if we go prevent defense. Do you agree? Do you know what that means? In football where they are holding the team to no score and then they go prevent the last two minutes and they lose the game. We will never go prevent. But you can take a look on the screen and you will see some of these things posted and they are really big polls. [GPE] were leading by I think like [CARDINAL], almost [CARDINAL] points. In [GPE] we are leading by a lot. In [GPE] the farmers can never vote for me. I got [GPE] to pay the farmers [MONEY] for the damage that they caused. I said, You got to pay. And so you see some of these, I just thought you'd put them up. Remember in [DATE], I used to always announce polls only if they were good, I would not announce them if they were not good. If I had a bad one, I would. But when they were good I used to drive the opposition crazy. But we are leading [PERSON] now by a lot, [CARDINAL] points, [CARDINAL] points and a [CARDINAL] point, but [CARDINAL] points in the last [ORG] poll. And I am the one that they do not want to run against, that is why they are coming after me like this. If they wanted me to run, they'd say, Oh no. He is the most perfect human being we have ever seen. Instead, they put these monsters in there, they put these radical left crazy people in. They are the party of disinformation, remember that. What they say, you can usually go the opposite. They say, Oh yeah, we want to run against [PERSON]. In the meantime, they got [CARDINAL] 000 prosecutors after my ass. We want to run against him so bad, we are going to run against him. That is the guy we want [PERSON]. By the way, please take him out of politics. Please get him out as fast as you can. Nah, they are the party of disinformation or misinformation, nobody knows the difference but they are pretty close. It is no wonder that the far left crazies are engaging in election interference on a historic scale. Nobody outside of this country, nobody has ever seen anything like what is happening now with the prosecutors, these [NORP] prosecutors, who release rapists and murderers while persecuting [NORP]. On [DATE] of my new administration I will direct the [ORG] with a very strong leader, not like [PERSON], not like [PERSON]. What a disaster he was. He was a rhino. He was afraid of being impeached. Please, I do not want to be impeached. So how do you not get impeached? Do not do anything. You do not do anything. Remember they were going to impeach him and then all of a sudden he actually said, no, he did not see any wrongdoing in the election. My young son, very young, saw a lot of wrongdoing in the election every. Did anybody in this room can they say they did not see any wrong? That was the worst horror show, I think [CARDINAL] of the greatest criminal acts ever, the election of [DATE]. But we will turn that around and it'll be even bigger. You know what? It will be even bigger. If you think about it, it'll be even bigger. Be much bigger than having one. We will be able to do things we could have never done because they have shown so bad. In other words, they want to show us. Well, they showed us. We have no energy. We have massive crime. Our military does not work. Nobody respects us in the whole world. I mean, there is not a leader that respects our leader. We will show them through [DATE] [DATE] that we are going through. The problem is we cannot take any more of it because we are not going to have a country left. But we will show them that we can do things and we will be able to do things on crime and other elements of society we will be able to do things that you probably would not have been able to do if you just carried it forward. So I think it is actually much bigger, this could be much bigger than if we went the more traditional route. I will direct the [ORG] to investigate every radical DA and attorney general and [NORP] for their illegal race in reverse based enforcement of the law. I will then appoint a team of warrior [GPE] attorneys, and I know know some great ones including from this area, who will be the polar opposite of the [PERSON]'s district attorneys. These guys, I mean, what they are thinking? Who can believe I mean, they are not stupid people. They are not stupid people. There is [CARDINAL] things. They are either stupid or they hate our country, and I do not think they are stupid because anybody that can cheat so well in election, they are not stupid. That means they hate our country and I believe they hate our country. They will be the [CARDINAL] most ferocious crime fighters in [NORP] history and I will task them with demolishing every gang, street crew and criminal network they can find piece by piece until public safety is fully restored, and that means in [NORP] run cities. And at the top of the list is [GPE] itself, which is absolutely plagued by numbers and crime that nobody's ever seen before. We have never seen anything like what is happening in [GPE]. Can you imagine these foreign leaders coming over from countries and they are looking at this filth and squalor and crime in our capitol? And I think we have to take it over. We have to take over management of our capitol because the people that are running, including the mayor who did nothing about [DATE], he was the one, No, we do not need anybody. We do not need any help. Along with crazy [PERSON], they did nothing. They did absolutely nothing. They were supposed to. They are in charge of it. But all of our [NORP] run cities are being absolutely ruined and destroyed. As we sit here and talk, they are being ruined. I will order the [ORG] to stop bullying gun store owners and wanting to shut them down for paperwork errors and instead go after drug dealers, human traffickers and criminal cartels, which is what they should be going after. Under [PERSON] other countries are emptying out their prisons insane asylums and mental institutions and sending them right here to the [GPE]. Can you imagine? Prisons and mental are being emptied out? I read a story not long ago where a man who takes care of a large segment of people in a mental institution in a [NORP] country, a doctor, sounded like a great man actually, he said he no longer has anything to do. He used to work [TIME] [DATE]. He said, All of our patients have been released into [GPE]. And this is what we have. This is what we have allowed to happen. And we cannot allow this to happen because we will not have a country any longer. We cannot allow it to happen. Under my leadership, we will quickly restore the most secure border in [GPE] history. We had the strongest border in history, and now we have, I think, the worst border in the history of the world because no country, even a Third World country, would allow what is happening right now to us to happen to them. The first reconciliation Bill I signed for a massive increase in border patrol. [ORG] and [PERSON] and all of his people, they are incredible, the job they do. [PERSON] as a man that knows it, you see him on television, I call him central casting. But these [CARDINAL] guys and all of the people that work with him, they are so good. They want to do their job. It is going to be a colossal increase in the number of [ORG] and [ORG], deportation offices following the [PERSON] model. I do not know if you know [PERSON] was very tough on the subject. We will use all necessary state, local, federal, and military resources to carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in [NORP] history. And I will ask every state and federal agency to identify every known or suspected gang member in [GPE]. And every one of them that is here legally we will pick them up and we will send them back to the country from which they came as we restore safety to our streets. We have have no choice. As we restore safety to our streets, we must also restore it to our schools. Hardening places of lording, we have to harden our assets to protect our children against threats of any kind. [DATE], our hearts were shattered by news of the monstrous attack on a [NORP] elementary school in [GPE] that claimed the lives of [CARDINAL] adults and [CARDINAL] precious children. [DATE] we wrapped those beautiful families in our love and we lift them up in our prayers. We also salute the law enforcement heroes who ran into danger and took out that killer with speed and skill that made us all very, very proud. That made us all very, very proud. It is a scandal and a tragedy that [DATE] after [DATE] [NORP] in [GPE] continue to hold common sense school safety measures hostage to their radical gun control agenda, which in virtually all cases would do nothing to prevent attacks by demented and disturbed individuals, of which we have many and many are coming into our country, but we are getting them out. Our country has been chock-full of guns for [DATE] and there was no talk of massacres of school children until [DATE]. That is when it really started. They started talking about it. This is not a gun problem. This is a mental health problem. This is a social problem. This is a cultural problem. This is a spiritual problem. Each and every one of these heinous attacks depend on the same cold-blooded calculation that the evil monster will have a window of time to act out their demonic fantasy unchallenged, they want to be unchallenged, they do not want challenge. The only way to stop these wicked acts is to ensure that any sicko who would shoot up a school knows that, within [TIME], not [TIME], they will face certain death. They have to know that, then they will not be doing it. For this reason, I will ask [ORG] to repeal totally ineffective legislation that makes it harder to protect our schools and easier for criminals to face absolutely no opposition when they go in. I will also create a new tax credit to reimburse any teacher for the full cost of a concealed carry firearm and training from highly qualified experts who is better. If even [PERCENT] of teachers, people that are skilled with arms, we want that. [PERCENT] were voluntarily armed and trained to stop active shooters, we would achieve effective deterrents and the problem would cease to exist and that would be a lot of people, but these are all people that are trained and talented with firearms. For [MONEY], we could fund arm security guards at the entrance every school in [GPE] and also arm every willing teacher. We want to arm some of these teachers that have to go through rigorous or some people say vigorous, I like vigorous better, I do not like rigorous, they have to go through vigorous training, but they are already there and they will do better than anybody you could put in. And they love our children. They really love our children. If we can send [MONEY] to [GPE], then we can afford [CARDINAL] of that amount to protect [NORP] children in [NORP] schools. We also need to drastically change our approach to mental health. Upon my inauguration, I will direct the [ORG] to convene, and it is going to happen quickly, to convene an independent outside panel to investigate whether transgender hormone treatments and ideology increase the risk of extreme depression, aggression, and even violence. I think most of us already know the answer, do not we? Furthermore, we have to look at whether common psychiatric drugs as well as genetically engineered cannabis and other narcotics are causing psychotic breaks, lot of problems. We are having problems that we have never seen before and people sort of think they understand why. We must also be much better at detecting warning signs of evil disturbed young men, like the one who murdered colleagues in [GPE], we cannot rest until we get to the bottom of all of the sickness that we are seeing in our country. I will fight to restore our safety and I will also fight to reclaim our freedom. We are going to have freedom in our country. We are going to be able to walk down the street and buy a loaf of bread and come back and not be shot. To defend our constitution and the rule of law, I will give you my word [DATE] that I will appoint rock solid constitutional conservatives to crush the [NORP] from our federal bench. They are communists, many of them. We did a great job. We set a record, but there is more to go. Before [DATE], I will once again release the full list of names from which I select my appointments to [ORG] so everyone can see who I am . Thinking about putting there, I did that last time and a lot of people said it made a big difference. It will be an all star roster of young fearless originalists in the mold of Justice [PERSON], great man and the great lion of [NORP] Liberty. Justice [PERSON], by the way, they are after him. Did you see it? They are after him now. They are after [PERSON] now, but he can take care of himself very well. At the same time, conservatives can no longer sit by and wait for the courts to save [GPE]. Our country is being plundered and ransacked by radical left barbarians who are trying to burn down every right and every liberty that we hold so dear. The next time we have power, [ORG] has to step up and stop this [NORP] revolution and it strikes. We have a [NORP] revolution going on and I think you are starting to see it. I think you are starting to see it, and we have to stop it fast. This is what we must do to save our country. With your vote and with a [NORP] house and a [NORP] [ORG], and we have a really good chance at both, I will lead the great rebirth of [NORP] freedom. We will build a future where we are free of crime and free of violence and free from fear, is fear, where we are free from dependence on foreign countries. We are so dependent on so many foreign countries, in particular [GPE], where we are free from the shackles of an unelected deep state from corrupt intelligence agencies, free from war, free from poverty, free to speak our minds, and last but certainly not least, free to keep and bear arms. And in closing, I have to state, the [GPE] is a mess. Our economy is crashing, inflation is out of control. [GPE] has joined with [GPE], unthinkable. [GPE], great people, have joined with [GPE]. [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE] have formed together as a menacing and destructive coalition. Our currency is crashing and will soon no longer be the world's standard, which will be our greatest defeat in [DATE] and was unthinkable [DATE]. Unthinkable that that could happen, but it is happening before your very eyes and we will not let it happen. With me, not even a chance, just like [GPE] would've never invaded [GPE], and [GPE] would not be having even a thought of raiding [GPE]. You did not hear about these things when I was president. If you took the [CARDINAL] worst presidents in the history of [GPE] and added them up, they would not have done near the destruction to our country as [PERSON] and the [PERSON] administration have done. We are a failing nation. We are a nation in decline, and now these radical left lunatics want to interfere with our elections by using law enforcement and we cannot let that happen. But with all of this being said, and with a very dark cloud hanging over our country, I have no doubt that we will, together as a group, make [GPE] great again. I have no doubt. Thank you. Thank you very much. God bless you all. God bless you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsberniesandersnhrallyspeechforjoebidenkamalaharrisoctober3", "text": "I have participated in many rallies in my life. This is clearly the most unusual. So, I want to thank everybody for being here for this limited audience event. It means a lot to me, and I know it means a lot to the Vice President. And let me begin by wishing the President and the First Lady a full and speedy recovery from the COVID-19 illness that they are now dealing with. And of course, we wish the same for my colleagues in the [ORG], as well as the many, many [CARDINAL] of [NORP] who are struggling with this terrible disease. What [DATE] have told us is, if there was ever any doubts, it should now be clear that no one, no one, is safe from this pandemic. It does not matter if you are a frontline worker in a hospital. And I want to take [TIME] to thank all of the doctors and the nurses and the medical personnel who have put their lives on the line to protect all of us. And it does not matter if you are an essential worker in a supermarket, if you are a packing house worker, if you are a bus driver, and it does not matter if you are the President of [GPE]. Each and every one of us is vulnerable, and we will remain vulnerable until there is a vaccine or a perfected cure. That is the reality, and there is no way to get away from that. There are some who say that we have to make a choice between having a strong economy and protecting the [NORP] people from this terrible disease. I disagree. The truth is, we will never have a strong economy so long as this pandemic continues to surge as it is [DATE]. We will never have a strong economy if people are afraid to go to work, afraid to go to school, afraid to shop, or afraid to have dinner at a restaurant, or afraid to do all of the things that we normally do. We will never have a strong economy unless we get this pandemic under control. Is the solution to this crisis to shut down the economy and lock everybody in their homes? No, it is not. We can keep our country moving forward if we do so in a way that is disciplined, not dangerous, that is responsible, not reckless. Now, I want to ask you and the [NORP] people some very simple questions. Which candidate for President has shown that he will be disciplined, that he will be responsible in dealing with this pandemic? Which candidate for President has made it clear that he will develop policies based on the advice of the best scientists in our country and the world? Which candidate for President will develop national protocols and guidelines and model the behaviors we all need to engage in to keep our families, our neighbors, and ourselves safe? Which candidate has the temperament to see us through this difficult crisis? Let me repeat that point. Which candidate has the temperament to see us through this difficult crisis? I do not think there is any doubt that the answer to those questions is that in the worst public health crisis of [DATE], we need [PERSON] as our president. Now, let me say a word about the economy. Let me be blunt, tell you the way it is. And that is that the working class of this country is in more desperation [DATE] than at any time since the Great Depression of the [DATE]. That is a fact. It is a sad fact, but that is the truth. [CARDINAL] of our fellow citizens have lost their jobs as a result of this pandemic. They have lost their incomes. They have lost their health insurance. They have depleted their life savings. They cannot afford to pay their rent or their mortgages. And in too many cases, in the richest country on Earth, they cannot afford to put food on the table for their kids. [DATE], the percentage of [NORP] who lack employment is at the highest level in [DATE], while [CARDINAL] of [NORP] who do have jobs are often working part-time for starvation wages. And as bad as the economy is in general, it is far worse for the [NORP] and [NORP] communities. During this pandemic, [PERCENT] of [NORP] families and [PERCENT] of [NORP] families have either experienced a job loss or a pay cut. How devastating is that? Meanwhile, and it is important to make this point because it is not made often enough, while the working class of this country is being devastated as a result of the pandemic, not everybody in [GPE] is hurting. The truth is that at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, over [DATE], that situation has gotten- [DATE], that situation has gotten even more grotesque. In [DATE], [CARDINAL] billionaires, that is not a lot of people, have seen their wealth go up by [MONEY]. And let me just say that again. While [CARDINAL] [NORP] have lost their jobs, while [CARDINAL] [NORP] have lost their health insurance, while [CARDINAL] [NORP] do not have enough food to eat, while [CARDINAL] of our people face eviction, [CARDINAL] billionaires increased their wealth by [MONEY] over [DATE]. So, that is the state of the economy [DATE]. Simple truth is that the very, very rich are getting much, much richer while nearly everybody else is struggling or getting poorer. And let us be very clear, despite what you may have heard over [DATE], the economy has not been very good for the working class of this country. And sometimes we lose track of that, but here is the truth, you do not have over [DATE], and I am not now just talking about [DATE], but you do not have a strong economy when [CARDINAL] of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. Do you all know what living paycheck to paycheck is about? I grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck. [PERSON] grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck. Many of you are living paycheck to paycheck. If you got one. It was not a good economy for [DATE] when [CARDINAL] [NORP] were uninsured or under-insured, could not get to a doctor when they were sick, and unbelievably and horrifically when [CARDINAL] 000 [NORP] were dying [DATE], because they could not go to the doctor when they got sick. Can you imagine that? Richest country in the history of the world, [CARDINAL] of our people die [DATE], because they cannot get to a doctor when they get sick, because they lack the money and do not have any health insurance. It is not and has not been a good economy when [CARDINAL] workers were earning starvation wages of [MONEY] an hour. And here, again, is the simple truth, nobody in [GPE] can make it on [CARDINAL], or [CARDINAL], or $[MONEY] an hour. And over [DATE], it has not been a good economy. When a [CARDINAL] of older workers, and we do not talk about this enough, when [CARDINAL] of older workers had no retirement savings. Imagine being [DATE], [DATE], [DATE], you do not got a nickel in the bank and now you are on retirement. And how do you do that with any shred of dignity? It is not a good economy when [CARDINAL] [NORP] are homeless! [CARDINAL] of our people are homeless, including many veterans who put their lives on the line to defend us. And as part of that housing crisis that we are experiencing [CARDINAL] families are spending [CARDINAL] of their incomes on housing or more! How do you take care of your basic needs if you are spending [CARDINAL] of your income on housing. But I must tell you, over [DATE], it was again a great economy for the billionaire class and it has become even better for them during this horrific pandemic. My friends, we need an economy that works for all of us, not just the few. And it is not just in [DATE], it is not just over [DATE]. Here is something else that we do not talk about. Over [DATE], there has been a massive redistribution of wealth in [GPE], but sadly, that redistribution has gone in the wrong direction. From the working class, from the middle class, from the poor to the very richest people in this country. Since [DATE], while [PERCENT] saw their wealth go up by [MONEY], you got that? Top 1% saw their wealth increase by [MONEY], the bottom [CARDINAL] of [GPE] saw their wealth actually go down. [DATE], the average worker in [GPE], and this is really quite astounding when you consider the growth of technology and the explosion in productivity, the average [NORP] worker [DATE] is now making $[MONEY] a week less than he or she did [DATE] after adjusting for inflation. Can you imagine that? Over a [DATE] period, an explosion in technology, increase in worker productivity, and yet the average [NORP] is earning less than he or she did [DATE]. What I understand, and I believe you understand, and the [NORP] people know is that we are all becoming more and more outraged with the corporate greed that we are seeing [DATE]. The [NORP] people are sick and tired of large, profitable corporations shutting down here in [GPE] and then moving to low wage countries all over the world. They are sick and tired of seeing CEOs now make [CARDINAL] times more than their average employees. While they give themselves huge bonuses, they cut back on their health care benefits of their workers. The [NORP] people are sick and tired of that corporate greed. They are sick and tired all of us paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. While at the same time, the pharmaceutical industry makes [CARDINAL]. the same time, the pharmaceutical industry makes [MONEY] in profit, [DATE] after [DATE] after [DATE]. In my view, the [NORP] people understand that we can no longer sustain an economy which has more income and wealth inequality [DATE] than at any time since [DATE]. When [CARDINAL] people own more wealth than the bottom [CARDINAL] of this country; [CARDINAL] people; that is not acceptable. Under [PERSON] and under a [NORP] [ORG], we are going to change all of that. Together, we are going to end a rigged tax code that allows billionaires to pay a lower tax rate, an effective tax rate, than nurses, teachers, and truck drivers. While at the same time, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth. So together, what this campaign is about, and what we must do in the future, is bring our people together by [CARDINAL] to create a government and an economy that works for all of us, not just the [PERCENT]. Now, it is no great secret that [PERSON] and I disagree on a number of issues. That is a fact. But there is also no question that the economic proposals that [PERSON] is supporting are strong, and will go a long, long way to improving life for working families. I want to take [TIME] to talk about those proposals. Because of everything that is going on in this crazy world [DATE], I think there has not been enough focus on [PERSON]'s economic proposals. Again, they are not mine, but they are strong proposals. And I want you and the [NORP] people to know what they are. [PERSON], you, and I know that it is not acceptable that [CARDINAL] of [NORP] work at starvation wages. People cannot make it on [MONEY] an hour. [PERSON] knows that, you know that, I know that. That is why [PERSON] is going to help us raise that minimum wage to at least [MONEY] an hour. What [PERSON] understands is that if you work [TIME] a week, you should not be living in poverty. [PERSON] also understands that it is absurd that women make [MONEY] on the dollar compared to men. If you are a minority woman, that is even lower. That is why [PERSON] is going to make sure that we have equal pay for equal work. [PERSON] also knows that the path toward a stronger middle class is strengthening trade unions in [GPE]. Right now, all across this country, there are [CARDINAL] of workers who want to join unions. But because of the heavy-handed corporate tactics that now exist, it is impossible for them to do that. [PERSON] and I and [ORG] [ORG] are going to go forward and make it easier for workers to join unions, engage in collective bargaining. [PERSON] also understands that we have got to stop providing corporate welfare to companies that are throwing [NORP] workers out on the street and moving abroad. It is absolutely insane that we provide welfare to these guys. Then they say thank you and they shut down factories and plants in [GPE]. There is something else that [PERSON] understands. And that is that in the midst of the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes, we need to create [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] of good-paying union jobs. The fastest way to do that is to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure; our roads, our bridges, our wastewater plants, our water systems; and to build [CARDINAL] of units of affordable housing. I will tell you what else [PERSON] understands. He understands that we have got to end the international embarrassment of [GPE] being the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid medical and family leave. When a woman in [GPE] gives birth, she should not be forced to go back to work after [DATE]. When a child gets sick, Mom or Dad should be able to stay home, take care of that kid, and not lose a [DATE]'s pay. I want everybody to hear it because it is not been talked about enough. That is why [PERSON] has proposed [DATE] of paid family and medical leave for working families. When we talk about babies and we talk about young children, we all know that our current childcare system is dysfunctional, and it is totally inadequate. Our children and their parents deserve high-quality, reliable, and affordable childcare. That is why [PERSON] has proposed universal pre-K education for every three- and four-year-old child in this country. When we talk about having the best educated workforce in the world, [PERSON] understands that we have got to make public colleges and universities tuition free for the working class of this country. And that we must substantially reduce student debt in [GPE]. And at a time of massive income wealth inequality, [PERSON] understands that we must- Equality, [PERSON] understands that we must demand that the wealthiest people and the most profitable corporations in our country start paying their fair share of taxes. No more tax breaks for billionaires while [CARDINAL] [NORP] sleep out on the street. No more tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas or shift their profits to [GPE]. [PERSON] also understands that [CARDINAL] out of [CARDINAL] [NORP] who walk into their doctor's office and gets a prescription, they cannot afford to fill that prescription because of the outrageous cost of prescription drugs in this country. And what [PERSON] knows and what I know is that if anybody is serious about healthcare reform, we have finally got to summon the guts to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. During my campaign for the presidency I took a trip from the Midwest, [QUANTITY] into [GPE] to buy insulin for diabetics. And we have got [CARDINAL] of people who were dealing with diabetes and the need for insulin. We went [TIME] away from [GPE], [GPE] into [GPE], [GPE]. We bought the same damn insulin as sold in [GPE] for [CARDINAL] the price that was charged in [GPE], [CARDINAL] the price. That is an outrage. And together, [PERSON] knows, I know, and you know that we have to take on the collusion, the price-fixing and the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, so that [NORP] no longer pay the highest prices in the world for the medicine we need. Now, as many of you also know, [GPE] is the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human, right. Meanwhile, despite paying almost twice as much per person for healthcare as the people of other countries, [CARDINAL] [NORP] [DATE] are uninsured or under-insured. And unbelievably, [CARDINAL] people go bankrupt [DATE] because they cannot afford to pay their medical bills. While [PERSON] and disagree on the best path to get to universal coverage, his proposal will greatly expand access to healthcare and make it more affordable for [CARDINAL] of people across this country. And here is an important point that has not been talked about enough during this campaign. He is going to lower the eligibility age for [ORG] from [DATE] to [DATE], meaning [CARDINAL] of more people will be eligible for [ORG]. He will expand [ORG] to cover dental core, eye glasses and hearing AIDS. And he will substantially increase funding for community health centers to make sure that [CARDINAL] of [NORP] get the primary health care and the mental health care that they desperately need. [PERSON] knows that when you talk about healthcare, you are talking about mental healthcare as well. And by the way, if the [NORP] gain control of the [ORG], you are looking at the chairman of the subcommittee on health. And trust me that the healthcare industry and the drug companies will understand a very new reality when that happens. Let me conclude by once again, thanking all of you for coming out [DATE] and for saying that in the wealthiest country, in the history of the world and I want everybody to remember that, sometimes we forget it. We are not a poor country. We are the wealthiest country, not only in the world, but in the history of the world. We need to create an economy that works for all of us. That works for our children. That works for our seniors. That works for the middle class, for the working class. We need to have a government and an economy that works for all, not just wealthy campaign contributors and [PERCENT]. There is no excuse, none whatsoever, that in our country we have [CARDINAL] of workers [DATE] who are unemployed. We can put those workers back to work. There is no reason why [CARDINAL] people lack health insurance or are under-insured. We can provide healthcare to all as a human right. There Is no reason why we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major on Earth. And a dysfunctional childcare system. If we love our country, we love our children and it is high time we had the best educational system in the entire world. Brothers and sisters, at this critical and unprecedented moment in [NORP] history, it is absolutely imperative that we stand together, black and white, [NORP], [NORP], [NORP], [NORP], gay, and straight. Those of us born in [GPE], those of us who are immigrants. Let us stand together and elect [PERSON] as the next president of [GPE]. Thank you all very much.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "warrensenategovnewsroompressreleasessenatorwarrendeliversspeechondangersofderegulation", "text": "Back when I was a young mom in [DATE], I liked to make toast for breakfast. [TIME] I popped a few pieces of bread in our toaster oven, got busy doing [CARDINAL] other things, and quickly forgot about the toast. When I saw smoke pouring out of the toaster oven, I grabbed the handle and pulled out the tray -four slices of bread were on fire. Always a quick thinker, I screamed and threw the tray at the kitchen sink. [CARDINAL] pieces of toast hit the target, but the fourth went high- setting the little yellow curtains on fire. I screamed again, then grabbed a cereal bowl and threw it at the burning curtains. The milk doused most of the fire, and I calmed down enough to realize that throwing things was probably not my best strategy. I grabbed a towel and beat on the toaster until everything seemed quiet and I could unplug it. That may have been [DATE] I started so many kitchen fires that Daddy gave me a fire extinguisher for [DATE]. Back then, our toaster oven had an on-off switch and that was it. On was On, which meant that it was possible to leave toast under the little broiler [TIME] and [TIME], until the food burned, the wiring melted, and the whole thing burst into flames. At some point, someone had the bright idea of adding a timer and automatic shutoff. This simple change made it a whole lot harder for distracted mothers, or anyone else, to leave the toaster running until it set the kitchen on fire. [DATE], while working on an article about how the government could protect consumers from predatory financial companies, I thought about those old toaster ovens. By then, it was all but impossible to buy a toaster that had a [CARDINAL] of bursting into flames and burning down your house. But by [DATE], it was possible to refinance a home with a mortgage that had a [CARDINAL] of costing a family their home and putting them out on the street. In fact, it was not just possible; those mortgages were being sold, then bursting into flames all over the country. Why the difference? The [GPE] government was the difference. Regulations were the difference. By [DATE], [DATE] I was writing my article, a government agency actually monitored toasters for basic safety, and if anyone tried to sell a toaster that had a tendency to burst into flames, the agency would put a stop to it. In fact, government regulations ensured the basic safety of pretty much every product offered for sale. Agencies like [ORG], [ORG], and [ORG] worked to keep us safe: But in [DATE] there was no government agency that would stop the sale of exploding mortgages. After the financial crisis we fought for [ORG] that would be a strong cop on the beat making financial products safer-we fought, and we won! And just in case you think applauding for a new agency makes you a nerd, think about this: That little agency has already put strong regulations in place on mortgages, student loans, and credit cards, and it has forced the big financial institutions to return [MONEY] directly to people who were cheated. [DATE] the consumer agency is under attack. [ORG] and an army of lobbyists are determined to rig the game in their favor, to boost their own profits - the cost to consumers be damned. But it is not just the [ORG] that under attack. In agency after agency, across the federal government, powerful corporations and their [NORP] allies are working overtime to roll back basic rules that protect the rest of us. Why is this happening? Why favor the profits of Wall Street banks over the economic security of [NORP] families? The answer is pretty simple - corruption. Giant corporations and wealthy individuals are working in the shadows to make sure that government works for them, not for the people. To hide what they are doing, big corporations and [NORP] here in [GPE] often claim that government regulations are bad for our economy. They go on and on about how big government restricts freedom and makes it harder for businesses to succeed. That is a big, greasy baloney sandwich-a greasy baloney sandwich that has been left out in the sun too long and has started to stink. Let us talk about real freedom - freedom from being cheated by those who care about pumping up their own profits and do not care about you. Regulations are about setting rules of the road-plain and simple. Done right, strong, clear regulations protect the freedom of every [NORP]. Do not tell me that all rules do is restrict freedom. Good rules empower people to live, work, and do business freely and safely. Regulations serve [CARDINAL] main functions. First, they provide the basic framework that permits commerce to flourish-to ensure that what we are promised is what we get. That [QUANTITY] of gas is really [QUANTITY]-and not [QUANTITY]. That the pills labeled as antibiotics really are antibiotics -- and they are not contaminated with mold. We get what we are promised. Second, regulations keep thieves out of our pockets. Rules are how we make it illegal to steal your purse on [FAC] or your pension on Wall Street. Third, regulations level the playing field for everyone competing for our business. Because of regulations, good companies that do right by their customers do not have to compete against cheaters. Competition should not be about who can hide the nastiest trick somewhere in the fine print; it should be about who offers the choices that customers like best. That is good for customers and good for upstart competitors who think they have a better product to offer. So let me say it outright: well-designed regulations allow for more freedom and more safety for each of us personally, more freedom and more opportunity for small businesses and startups, and more freedom and more security for workers who are building a future for their families, and more freedom for every business that is willing to compete straight up on the quality of its goods and services. The so-called war on regulations is not about freedom. The war on regulations is waged on behalf of giant companies that do not want to follow any rules. So let us call it what it really is - a war on public health, a war on public safety, a war on truly free and competitive markets, a war on [NORP] workers, a war on [NORP] consumers. [NORP] in [GPE] talk about regulation like it is some kind of uncontrollable [PERSON]'s monster with an independent will of its own, a beast that will chew our bones. They use the word regulation like a magic incantation, a fearsome word that can be repeated [CARDINAL] times to ward off the evils of so-called big government. But [GPE]'s history tells a very different story about regulation. [DATE], the Industrial Revolution began to stir, and factories sprouted up all over. Industrialization radically altered the [NORP] economy, and it generated enormous wealth. But it also wreaked havoc on workers and their families. As industrialization spread across the country, families poured in from farms to cities, only to land in workplaces that were monstrously unsafe. Wages were paltry, and [TIME] were grueling. [GPE]'s response was not to abandon the technological innovations and improvements of the industrial revolution. We did not send everyone back to the farms. No. Instead, we came together as a country, and, through our government, we changed public policies to adapt to a changing economy. In other words, we adjusted the laws - the regulations - to keep much of the good and get rid of much of the bad. Over time, the list of new laws and regulations grew: A minimum wage. Workplace safety. Workers compensation.Child labor laws. The [TIME] workweek.The right to unionize. These protections set up guardrails so giant corporations could no longer exploit workers just to boost their own profits. In addition to protecting workers, [GPE] also took steps to protect our financial system. From colonial times until [DATE], [GPE] pretty much took the economic world the way it was. Booms and busts were just the way things worked and there was not much we could do about it-sort of like the natural cycles of the moon. And those crashes hurt. Sure, they took down speculators, but they also took out farmers, small business owners, employees and [CARDINAL] of people who got swept away by massive economic forces that they could not control. Then the big one hit-the Great Depression. Unemployment skyrocketed, peaking at [PERCENT] 20 percent. Bread lines swelled. Across the country, frightening rumors caused [NORP] to rush to empty their bank accounts, triggering more crises. In the midst of this chaos, [PERSON] stepped up with a bold idea: We can do better. We can use regulation to end the boom-and-bust cycles. And that is exactly what he did. In the wake of the Great Depression, [GPE] put in place strong laws and rules that stabilized our financial system: For [DATE], those rules stayed in place-and they worked. The devastating economic crashes were gone. Regulations bought us economic stability. And the financial services industry served the [NORP] people, rather than the other way around. Regulations to protect workers. Regulations to make financial marketplaces fairer. GDP was climbing and [GPE]'s middle class was getting a huge share of all that growth. We were on a roll. In [DATE], environmental issues moved front and center, along with the safety of [GPE]'s families. It may be hard to believe, but back in the [DATE], big [NORP] cities were smothered with thick layers of nasty, dirty smog. People sucked down toxic chemicals on the way to work; little kids breathed in dangerous substances on school playgrounds. The factory owners that spewed their filth in the air did not care -- they did not pay the cost of their pollution. The auto manufacturers were not held responsible for the tailpipe emissions from the cars they built. But [CARDINAL] who suffered asthma attacks, developed lung cancer, and died from heart disease because of dirty air paid a terrible price. During [DATE] in [DATE], a severe smog crisis choked [GPE], killing [CARDINAL] of people. People demanded action, but giant corporations pushed back hard. Big carmakers said that they would never be able to meet the deadlines to reduce emissions, that it would cost too much to adapt their vehicles, that they would go bankrupt. But the people prevailed. The new [ORG] was born. [ORG] passed the Clean Air Act, giving the [ORG] the authority to put in place strong new rules and clear deadlines to protect us. The results? From [DATE] to [DATE], common air pollutants fell [PERCENT]. [DATE], the Clean Air Act saves [CARDINAL], 000 lives a year. [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] 000 people-our neighbors, our families. [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] people Every. Single Year. What [GPE] has accomplished through strong, public-centered rules is an amazing story. So where are the cheerleaders? Where are the defenders of the regulators who make sure most of us do not work in factories where equipment could kill us or drive cars with defective brakes? Where are the parades and special citations for the federal employees who make sure that cancer treatments really are cancer treatments and that the air is clean enough for our babies to breathe and grow and flourish? Where are the thank-you op-eds and national holidays to celebrate that infants are no longer strangled in poorly designed baby cribs and that airplanes rarely crash? What happened? How did those regulators-and the regulations designed to help the [NORP] people-become the enemy? The answer, once again is not complex. The answer is corruption. By [DATE], corporate giants who did not want to follow the rules had a plan to fight back. They figured they could improve their profit margins by rolling back those rules, and the best way to do that was to control the rulemakers. So they made political contributions, then lobbied those same elected officials to leash up the regulators. It was called deregulation -but that was just a code word for let the rich guys do whatever they want. Let 'em lie, let 'em cheat, let 'em steal, and-if anyone asks, pretend that was a good thing. Does that sounds a little harsh? Consider what happened in the financial industry. Remember all those tough rules [PERSON] put in place after the Great Depression, the ones that worked to make our economy safer? When [PERSON] began his systematic campaign of deregulation, those rules came under attack. And they stayed under attack, [DATE] after [DATE], president after president-regardless of party. For [DATE], the [ORG] and other bank regulators looked the other way as big financial institutions found new ways to trick their customers. The result should have surprised exactly no one. After another boom, in [DATE], our economy came crashing to the ground-dragging along [CARDINAL] of [NORP] who lost their homes, their jobs, their savings, the very lives they had spent [DATE] to build. [DATE] of deregulation, a crash that nearly brought our economy to its knees, a recovery that has left most of [GPE] behind, and what is [ORG] answer? More deregulation. MORE deregulation. Make this government work better and better for the richest and most powerful. Oh, sure. Back in [DATE], Candidate [PERSON] made big promises, promises to drain the swamp, promises to fight for working people, promises to ignore lobbyists, promises to stand up to Wall Street. It is clear now that those promises were just part of the scam-a scam that has paid off handsomely for Wall Street, paid off handsomely for every corporation that can hire an army of lobbyists or drop big money at a nearby [ORG], paid off handsomely for every billionaire or corporate executive who has pocketed part of the [MONEY] tax giveaway. Paid off big time. But for [NORP] families, the big payoff still has not arrived. And there is more payoff for big corporations as [ORG] rolls back worker protections. The agenda: And how about the important environmental protections that protect the health of our families - the ones we put in place to make sure we can drink the water and breathe the air? President [PERSON] started by appointing [PERSON] to head the [ORG]. Corruption oozes out of his office, from wasting [MONEY], to cutting deals to make himself rich, to doing the bidding of the highest paid lobbyists. Consider clean water. The Clean Water Rule is designed to protect drinking water, but industry opposes the rule because it means they cannot dump chemicals in rivers or spread toxic waste on the ground where it might run into drinking water. And since industry does not like the Clean Water Rule, [PERSON] has come up with a plan for ending it. Think about pesticides. [DATE], the [ORG] decided to ban a dangerous pesticide that puts children at risk. But right after [PERSON] met with the CEO of [ORG], the rule was gone. Or power. The Clean Power Plan is biggest step we have taken to fight against climate change. But once [PERSON] met with executives from Big Coal, the [ORG] announced plans to end the rule. In [DATE], the [ORG] has worked to roll back [CARDINAL] environmental rules, from revoking car emissions standards to undercutting efforts to limit methane gas. In the name of deregulation, [PERSON] has told corporations they can boost their profits by poisoning our water, fouling our air, contaminating our food and threatening the planet we call home. All told, [ORG] estimates that [ORG]'s rollbacks will cost the [NORP] people [MONEY] per year. And some of those costs will be measured in hospital admissions and funeral bills. The same attitude permeates [ORG]. President [PERSON] has even worked to weaken [ORG] - the agency that makes sure toasters do not explode. He is nominated a new chair who has opposed safety protections for table saws, and nominated a new commissioner who defended companies that knowingly sold all-terrain vehicles that tipped over and crushed children to death. I could keep going, but these examples make one thing clear: President [PERSON] and his team have embarked on an aggressive effort to kill the rules that protect the [NORP] people from corporate predators. OK, now is the part where we need to state the obvious: No, I do not think every regulation is good. Sometimes regulators get it wrong. Sometimes old rules need updating. Sometimes rules should be eliminated outright. And the corruption of our rulemaking process runs so deep that sometimes rules get perverted into government-sponsored protections for giant corporations instead of protection for the public. You do not have to tell me. [CARDINAL] of the most significant regulatory rollbacks enacted by the current [ORG] eliminates a thicket of anti-competitive restrictions that reduce access and drive up the cost of hearing aids for [CARDINAL] of [NORP]. I know that because I wrote the bill to roll back the regulations, I worked with conservatives to advance it, and I got it signed into law by President [PERSON]. But these kinds of regulatory changes-the pro-competition, pro-consumer changes-are not what the [NORP]' agenda is about. No, the [NORP] are working to insulate big corporations from competition and accountability. They are making government work better and better for fewer and fewer people. This is a critical moment for our country. The [NORP] control both [ORG] and [ORG], and they are using their control to fulfill a corporate de-regulatory agenda that promotes profits for executives and investors over the safety, security and opportunity of everyone else. And yeah, that is pretty grim. But I am here [DATE] because I am an optimist. I am an optimist because I believe that change is possible. I know it is hard. Ending this war against [GPE]'s families will take fights on several fronts. We cannot win until we pry our government free from the grip of the rich and the powerful. That is why, in [DATE], I will introduce sweeping anti-corruption legislation to clean up corporate money sloshing around [GPE] and make it possible for our elected government to actually work for the [NORP] people again. My plan will: Ending this war on public safety and competitive markets will also take standing up and making the case, loud and clear: strong government rules matter. We cannot - we must not - accept a government that works only for a privileged few. Government remains the best tool we have to create a level playing field so everyone-white, brown, black, young, old-everyone gets a turn. Government is the best tool we have to make sure everyone-male, female, rich, poor-everyone who pitches in gets a shot at success. Government matters, and we cannot be afraid to say so. Change is coming. When we send a message that corporate profits and powerful interests cannot overpower the health, safety, and economic well-being of hardworking families, we fire a warning shot. This is our time, our responsibility, our chance to rebuild a country where government works, not just for the rich and powerful, but for the people.", "discourse_type": 0}

We have an expression we used to have an expression when I served in the [ORG] Senator [PERSON] they said when they wanted to make some statement that was personal, they'd say, A point of personal privilege. You know, when you were talking about being a waterman, working on the water my family is originally from [GPE], came in [DATE]. And the entire [PERSON] family worked in the water were watermen until probably [DATE] or -8. And my father was raised here in [GPE]. They do not say [GPE]. They say [ORG]. And so, you know, although they never worked at the port, they did work in the bay and along here. So, you know, this has been this is [CARDINAL] the oldest ports in the country continuously running and one of the best ports in the country. And so, [PERSON], thanks for that introduction. And, Mayor [PERSON], thanks for the passport into the city. I appreciate it very much. And I want to thank Governor [PERSON] for being here and members of the delegation. I want start off with [CARDINAL] of my best buddies and, I think, [CARDINAL] of the most effective people in [ORG], [PERSON]. Do not if you need something, go to him, man. He knows how to get it done. And to also [PERSON]. And a guy who I knew him when he was a kid. He does not remember me. I am getting so old; I knew his dad, Senator [PERSON]. And Congressman [PERSON], Congressman [PERSON], and all all of this delegation. You got a first-rate delegation. And so, I want to thank them for being here [DATE] and thank them for all the help in getting the members of the [ORG] and getting the legislation passed. It is a big deal. It is going to make a big difference. The reason I started calling this Build Back Better is: We are the only country in the world we underestimate ourselves; we are sort of down on ourselves [DATE] or so we are the only country in the world, as a matter of history, that every crisis we have faced we have come out better on the other side. We not only beat it not a joke, think about it we have come out better than we were before we went into the crisis. And the economic and political, as well as the health crisis we found with [PERSON] I was determined, when we got elected, we got to build it back better than it was. Because the world is changing so rapidly so rapidly, man. We got to keep up. We are in competition to determine whether or not we can still remain the most powerful economic force in the world. And so, [DATE], I am here to talk about one of the most pressing economic concerns of the [NORP] people and it is real. And that is: getting prices down, number [CARDINAL]; number [CARDINAL], making sure our stores are fully stocked; and number [CARDINAL], getting a lot of people back to work while tracking and tackling these [CARDINAL] above challenges I mentioned. [DATE]'s economic reports showing unemployment continuing to fall, but consumer prices remain too high. Tell us the Ameri- the [NORP] people, in the midst of an economic crisis, that recovery is showing strong results, but not to them. They are still looking out there. Everything from a gallon of gas to loaf of bread costs more. And it is worrisome, even though wages are going up. We still face challenges, and we have to tackle them. We have to tackle them head on. And on the good side, we are seeing the highest growth rate in [DATE], the fastest decrease in unemployment at this point ever since [DATE]. Jobs are up. Wages are up. Value is up. And savings are up. But we are we got problems too. Many people remain unsettled about the economy, and we all know why. They see higher prices. They go to the store online, or they cannot or they go to the store go online and they cannot find what they always want and when they want it. And we are tracking these issues and trying to figure out how to tackle them head on. My administration, with the help of the folks on my left over here, is has a plan to finish the job at getting us back to normal from the pandemic and having a stronger economy than we have ever had before. Let me explain the part that the ports play and why they are so critically important. It starts with a piece of good news: [DATE] has finally arrived. How many times did you hear over [DATE] [DATE] is coming? Yeah, uh-huh. Anyway, but, [DATE], we took a monumental step forward as a nation and we did something long overdue and long talked about in [GPE] but almost never actually done: [ORG] passed my Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill. Along with another plan that I am advancing, this bill is going to reduce the cost of goods to consumers and businesses, and get people back to work, helping us build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out that where everybody is better off. You know, I am tired of this trickle-down economy stuff. I come from [GPE] just across the line up here and, you know, we have more corporations in [GPE] than every other nation in the state [state in the nation] combined. And so, I understand big business. The fact of the matter is, it is time they start paying their fair share. The fact is, you have [CARDINAL] corporations [DATE] that, in fact, made [MONEY] did not pay [MONEY] in taxes. Nobody is going to nobody is going to pay more if you make [MONEY], you are not going to pay anything more in taxes at all. Period. Guaranteed. Including gasoline tax. Not going to additional, from a federal government standpoint. And so, look, this is a once-in-a-generation investment to create good-paying jobs, modernize our infrastructure, turn the climate crisis into an opportunity. When I talk climate to other world leaders, I think [CARDINAL] thing: We are dealing with climate think jobs. Good jobs. Because that is how you beat the climate crisis. Put us on a path to win the economic competition of [DATE] we face with [GPE] and the rest of the world. [GPE] is outspending us on research and development. And [GPE] is outspending all these these other countries are as well. And here is what I am going to do: I am going to create good-paying union jobs union. Not good jo- not [MONEY] an hour, not [MONEY] an hour [MONEY] an hour and up with good benefits so you can raise a family on and build the middle class out. And jobs that cannot be outsourced; they cannot outsource these jobs. And I am going to transform our transportation system with the most significant investment in passenger rail in [DATE]; in roads and bridges the most significant investment in [DATE]; and investments in public transit that we have done over the period. You know, it is going to it is going to modernize our ports with [MONEY] in investment [MONEY] in investment. We are going to reduce congestion. We are going to address repair and maintenance backlogs, deploy state-of-the-art technologies, and make our ports cleaner and more efficient. And we are going to do the same with our airports and freight rail. We are going to create jobs replacing lead water pipes that are here in [GPE], as well as every other state in the union, that are poisoning our kids and others. We are going to make high-speed Internet affordable and available to everywhere in [GPE]. Those of you who have kids in school when we we have been going to this hybrid thing some in class, some out of class how many times if you haven- if you do not live in an area where you have high-speed Internet you can afford, how many times have you driven your kids to the parking lot of [ORG] and sat there going off the [ORG]'s Internet so you could hear? No, I am not joking. Think of this [GPE], for God's sake. So, folks, we are going to build the first-ever national network of electric vehicle charging stations all across the country. [ORG] is going to put in [CARDINAL] charging stations across the country. And guess what? That is in the Recovery Act excuse me that is in the Build Back Better Bill, which is not going to raise taxes [MONEY]. It is totally paid for. Totally paid for by making taxes work for people who make [MONEY] and just do their fair share. I am a capitalist, man. You should be able to be a millionaire or billionaire if you can. But pay your fair share. Pay something along the line.I am going to get [GPE] off the sidelines on manufacturing the manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries to store energy and power the electric vehicles from school buses to automobiles. We are also going to make historic investments in environmental cleanup and remediation, rebuilding resilience against superstorms and droughts and wildfires and hurricanes. I traveled all over the country [DATE]. You know, there is nine- literally, [MONEY] in losses because of storms [DATE]. [MONEY]. You ever think you'd hear somebody stand up and say, The Colorado River is being drained? Did you ever think you'd see you'd go out more wildfires in the West than the entire and lost land lost, homes lost burned to the ground I have flown over in [FAC] than the entire state of [GPE], from the Cape all the way to [GPE]. That is how much we have lost in [GPE] so far so far. And according to the economic experts, this bill is going to ease inflationary pressures, lowering the cost to working families. [CARDINAL] excuse me yeah, [CARDINAL] Nobel laureates in economics wrote a letter to me [DATE] saying this is going to affect bring inflation down, not up. Best of all, the vast majority of these jobs are going to create that we are going to create do not require a college degree do not require it. This is the ultimate blue-collar blueprint to rebuild [GPE]. I am not waiting to sign a bill to start improving the flow of goods from ships to shelves. [DATE], I announced a port of a port plan of action. It lays out concrete steps for my administration to take over [DATE] to invest in our ports and to relieve bottlenecks. This builds on the progress we have already made. [DATE], I reached a deal with [CARDINAL] of the largest ports in [GPE] [FAC] and [GPE]. And I met with you guys, with the longshoremen there, and we worked out a deal between the port owners and the longshoremen to move toward operating those [CARDINAL] ports. [PERCENT] of everything in the Pacific comes through those [CARDINAL] ports. And they are lined up ships are lined up [CARDINAL] lined up out as far as you could see. So they all agreed they are going to go [TIME] a day, [DATE] a week. It is already paying off. [DATE], the number of container ships in the docks for [DATE] fell by [PERCENT]. And now we are announcing steps to improve ports on the East Coast to provide support for [FAC], the fourth-largest container port in the country, to help reduce congestion. With our help, they now have the funds they need to set up [CARDINAL] new inland port sites in [GPE] and [GPE] so goods can get closer to their final destination more quickly. And other ports across the country will have the resources they need to make these kinds of immediate investments as well. The challenge we need to meet here, and that my plan is going to help address, has to do with the supply chain. You hear a lot about the supply chains in the news, but, frankly, not a lot of people are clear or have a clear understanding, whether they have a PhD or they did not go to school, about how a supply chain works. It is easy to talk about it, but what is the impact on the economy, let alone how to fix it? It is perfectly understandable because supply chains are incredibly complex. And as long as goods and materials are getting where they need to go on time, there is usually no need to worry about the supply chains. But when global disruptions hit, like a pandemic, they can hit supply chains particularly hard. COVID-19 has stretched global supply chains like never before. And suddenly, when you go to order a pair of sneakers or a bicycle or [DATE] presents for the family, you are met with higher prices and long delays, or they say they just do not have any at all. And the reason for that, [DATE], was has a lot to do with most companies make their product how they make their products [DATE]. In simple terms, a supply chain is just the journey that a product takes to get to your doorstep: raw materials plus labor, assembly, shipping everything it takes to create the finished product. These supply chains are complex. Even products as simple as a pencil can have to use wood from [GPE], graphite from [GPE] before it comes together at a factory in [GPE] to get a pencil. It sounds silly, but that is literally how it happens. So if, all of a sudden, you got a COVID crisis in [GPE], you cannot get the product maybe because the plant shuts down. That is what is happening. Products like smartphones often bring together parts from [GPE], [GPE]; chips from the [GPE]; touchscreens from [GPE]; camera components from [GPE] a supply chain that crosses [CARDINAL] of countries. That is just the nature of a modern economy the world economy. But global supply chains have helped dramatically bring down the price we pay for things we buy. But they have also made us much more reliant on what happens in other parts of the world. So if a factory in [GPE] shuts down due to a COVID outbreak which they have it causes a ripple effect that can slow down auto manufacturing in [GPE]. Why? They cannot get the computer chips they need. If a climate disaster closes a port in [GPE], it can delay shipment of furniture or clothing, reduce worldwide supply, and driving up prices here in [GPE]. And the irony is: People have more money now because of the first major piece of legislation I passed. You all got checks for $[MONEY], 400. You got checks for a whole range of things. If you are a mom and you have kids under [DATE], you are getting [MONEY] a month, and if it is [DATE], you are getting $[MONEY] a month like wealthy people used to when they'd get back tax returns. It changes people's lives. But what happens if there is nothing to buy and you got more money? You compete for getting it there. It creates a real problem. So, on the [CARDINAL] hand, we are facing new disruptions to our supplies. But at the same time, we are also experiencing higher demand for goods because wages are up, as well as as well as people have money in the bank. And because of the strength of our economic recovery, [NORP] families have been able to buy more products. And but guess what? They are not going out to dinner and lunch and going to the local bars because of COVID. So what are they doing? They are staying home, they are ordering online, and they are buying product. Well, with more people with money buying product and less product to buy, what happens? The supply chain is the reason, and the answer is you guys and I will get to that in [TIME] but what happens? Prices go up. So, we got [PERCENT] more goods coming into the country than we did before the pandemic struck. In [DATE] excuse me COVID-19 has changed the way we spend our time and our money. More products are being delivered than ever before. That is because people have a little more breathing room than they did [DATE], and that is a good thing. But it also means we got a higher demand for goods at the same time we are facing disruptions in the supplies to make those goods. There is a reci- this is a recipe for delays and for higher prices, and people are feeling it. They are feeling it. Did you ever think you'd be paying this much for a gallon of gas? In some parts of [GPE], they are paying $[MONEY] a gallon. That is why it is so important that we do everything in our power to stabilize the supply chain. And here is the good news: [DATE], I spoke with the CEOs personally spoke with the CEOs of the major retailers [ORG], [ORG] and the leading freight movers [ORG] and [ORG]. They assured me that the shelves will be stocked in stores [DATE] because they signed on to [CARDINAL] as well. They signed on to [CARDINAL]. And they provide more avenues they are getting more of their containers off the ports quicker than ever before. Because a lot of stuff on the ports, it was sitting around, staying there. Why? Because it no longer is the product they need at this moment. And it does not cost them anything to leave them sitting at the port, rather than in their warehouses. That is moving as well. Part of the reason why is because my Port Envoy, [PERSON] who was the Secretary of [ORG] here for [CARDINAL] governors [PERSON] has worked with the operators, the shippers shipping companies and unions and retailers to speed commerce so they can get products to stores and to your doors, and to get the shelves fully stocked [DATE]. Instead of pointing fingers, we are seeing folks start to work together: railroads, ocean liners, labor, state and local governments. The progress has already begun. And now we passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill the deal it is only going to accelerate. You have heard me say it before: Infrastructure infrastructure used to be rated, in [GPE], as the best in the world when I got to the [ORG]. But [DATE], according to [ORG], you know where we rank in infrastructure? Thirteenth in the world. [CARDINAL] countries in the world have more modern, efficient infrastructure than [GPE]. By investing in our roads, our bridges, our ports, and so much else, this bill is going to make it easier for companies to get goods to market more quickly. Here in [GPE], you have got a port that is older than [GPE] itself, and it is been operating for [DATE]. By the way, you got any [NORP] here any former [NORP]? Raise your hand. Well, if you are here as a [NORP], happy birthday. It is your 247th birthday [ORG]. They deserve some applause. Look, this port is connected to the nation's oldest rail line, [ORG], which which in turn relies on the tunnels that are [DATE], those tunnels. Okay? The tunnel has become a major bottleneck to the port. Now, [ORG] will be getting a [MONEY] grant to upgrade that tunnel so freight trains can come double-stacked through that tunnel double-stacked with with these cars with containers on top of them. Twice as much. They move out a hell of a lot more quickly if they are going if they are imports going out, but if they are exports going across the ocean. That means, in addition to more good jobs being filled, more products on shelves delivered faster and lower prices. It is about taking a long-term view of our economy to deliver lower costs, more jobs, and ensure our shelves are stocked with product. And the longer-term view means building greater resilience to withstand both the shocks and disruptions we can anticipate as the world continues to change: pandemics, weather extremes, cyberattacks, or whatever else comes our way. And they are all going to come our way. You know it. We need to be ready. We need companies throughout the supply chain to create and support good-paying jobs for people that are that they can grow in, build skills in, join a union, make a decent living. That is when disruption hits so when disruption hits, companies can quickly adapt because they are invested in their workers, their skills, their training, and a strong foundation of what when I always think unions and my family, I think of dignity and respect. That is what it is about: dignity and respect. Taking a longer-term view also means making [ORG] not just a promise, but an ironclad reality.When I got elected, I said we are going to I get to spend quote, unquote [MONEY] of your money making everything from aircraft carriers to balloons. But guess what? So much of it has been going out and getting foreign contractors to do it. Well, this administration has been doing we set new rules to strengthen our domestic supply chains with a new [ORG] office within [ORG]. Never again should our country be left unable to produce critical goods because we do not have access to the materials we need. Never again should we have to rely on [CARDINAL] company or [CARDINAL] country, particularly when the country does not share our values. I have said it before: We are in a competition for [DATE] and who is going to own it. [GPE] still has the most productive workers in the world and the most innovative minds in the world. That is not hyperbole, that is a fact. But other countries are closing in. We risk losing our edge if we do not step up now. This Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill is a major step forward. It represents the biggest investment in ports in [NORP] history. And for [NORP] families, it means products moving faster and less expensively from factory floor, through the supply chain, to your home. The bottom line is this:With the bill we passed [DATE] and the steps we are taking to reduce bottlenecks at home and abroad, we are set to make significant progress. We are already in the midst of a historic economic recovery. And thanks to those steps we are taking, very soon we are going to see the supply chain start catching up with demand. So not only will we see more record-breaking job growth, we will see lower prices and faster deliveries as well. This work is going to be critical as we implement the infrastructure bill and as we continue to build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out by passing the Build Back Better plan. We need to unlock the full might and dynamism of our economy, guys, and of our people. I really mean it. And with this plan, we have set in motion what a- that is what is exactly what we are going to do: We are going to build a better [GPE] not a joke. We are going to lead the world again not a joke. We are going to be in a position where we once again own [DATE], because when we own it, everybody does better. Everybody. Not only [GPE], but around the world. Sorry to take so long. And the sun is down. You do not have any sweater on. You are going to freeze. I am going to stop talking. A man with little as little hair as mine just took his hat off. I'd put it back on. You are going to get cold if I do not step down. But look, all kidding aside, I want to particularly thank the longshoremen. You guys there is an old expression up in [GPE], [GPE], where I was from: Y'all brung me to the dance, man. You have stuck with me from the first time I ran. And you have stepped up every time you have been asked every time you have been asked. And I want to personally thank you while I am standing in front of you. God bless you all, and God bless all the workers that keep our economy going. And make God protect our troops. Thank you so very much. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "trumpwhitehousearchivesgovbriefingsstatementsremarkspresidenttrump2019conservativepoliticalactionconference", "text": "Oh, thank you very much. Thank you very much. And thank you very much also to a man named [PERSON]. What a job he is done. And to [ORG] I actually started quite a while ago at [ORG], and came here probably made my first real political speech. And I enjoyed it so much that I came back for a second one, then a third. Then I said, what the hell, let us run for President. Right? But it is wonderful to be back with so many great patriots, old friends, and brave young conservatives. What a future you have. Our movement and our future in our country is unlimited. What we have done together has never been done in the history maybe of beyond of country, maybe in the history of the world. They came from the mountains and the valleys and the cities. They came from all over. And what we did in [DATE] the Election, we call it, with a capital E it is never been done before. And we are going to do it, I think, again in [DATE], and the numbers are going to be even bigger. And we all had to endure, as I was running. So you had [CARDINAL] [NORP], plus me. And I was probably more of a conservative than a [NORP]. People just did not quite understand that. They did not understand it. I think now, with what we have done with the judiciary and so many other things, I think they get it very well. And it is driving the other side crazy. But we all had to endure, remember? How many times did you hear, for [DATE] and [DATE], There is no way to [CARDINAL]? You know what that means, right? There is no way to [CARDINAL]. They could not get me there. We might as well have just given up. But there was not any way to [CARDINAL]. In fact, I actually went up to [GPE] to get one, and I did win the one. But we did not need the one. We did not need it. We won [GPE]. We won our [CARDINAL] of [GPE], remember? You have [GPE]. We won both in [GPE]. We won the [CARDINAL] we had to win in [GPE]. So we got the one, but we did not need the one, because we did not get [CARDINAL]; we got [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL]. [CARDINAL]-306. A state called [GPE], a state called [GPE], where by the way, where [ORG] just announced a [MONEY] incredible expansion and new plant, doubling their workforce. Many, many car companies have moved back to [GPE] and are continuing to do so. Big numbers. Nobody every thought they'd see that happen. So I think we are going to do even better in [DATE]. I think we are going to do numbers that people have not seen for a long time. The men and women here [DATE] are on the frontlines of protecting [GPE]'s interests, defending [GPE]'s value, and reclaiming our nation's priceless heritage. It is true. With your help, we are reversing [DATE] of blunders and betrayals. These are serious, serious betrayals to our nation and to everything we stand for. It is been done by the failed ruling class that enriched foreign countries at our expense. It was not [GPE] first. In many cases, it was [GPE] last. [DATE] are over. Long over. [GPE] is winning again. [GPE] is respected again. And the world knows it. When I meet with prime ministers, when I meet with presidents and I get along with them because they know that what is taken place over [DATE] not just the [PERSON] administration; long before that they cannot believe, themselves, that they got away with it. They cannot believe it. An impossible thing. And they like me. And the reason they like me they tell me; they say, Mr. President I said as an example, President [PERSON] of [GPE], I have great respect. We have a great relationship. I say, How is it possible that you got away with this for so long? And he said, Because nobody ever asked us to change. It is true. When they charge [PERCENT] tariffs on our cars going into [GPE], and we charge them nothing coming into our country; when they raise their tariff from [PERCENT] to [PERCENT] and then to [PERCENT] and they said to me, We expected that somebody would call and say you cannot do that. Nobody called, so we just left it. And I do not blame them. We should've been doing the same thing to them. But we did not . True. Right? Hard to believe. It is hard to believe. But now things are different. Now we are negotiating with [GPE]. They would not negotiate with previous administrations. But I found some very old laws from when our country was rich really rich. The old tariff laws we had to dust them off; you could hardly see, they were so dusty. But, fortunately, they were not terminated. We started getting politically correct, even back then. But I said, when we were doing the great things, what happened to those laws? And I checked, and I found [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL]. I found [CARDINAL], [DATE], where we can do what we have to do. But, you know, they had a debate in it was really a tough time in our country because we had so much money we did not know what the hell to do with it. Tough, tough, tough. It was called the Great Tariff Debate. [PERSON] will look this up. And the problem is, with [PERSON], if I make a little mistake, he will let us know on [DATE] [TIME]. I got to be very careful when I talk about this. But it was the Great Tariff Debate of 1888. And the debate was: We did not know what to do with all of the money we were making. We were so rich. And [PERSON], prior to being President, he was very strong on protecting our assets, protecting our country. And he made statements that, Others cannot come into our country and steal our wealth and steal our jobs, and build their country and not defend our country. We cannot do that. We cannot ever allow that to happen. And, you know I do not know, maybe you know. You know I am totally off-script, right? Thank you, darling. You know I am totally off script right now. And this is how I got elected, by being off script. True. And if we do not go off script, our country is in big trouble, folks. Because we have to get it back. And when I look at what is happening on the other side, I encourage it. I say, No, no I think the New Green Deal, or whatever the hell they call it The Green New Deal, right? Green New Deal I encourage it. I think it is really something that they should promote. They should work hard on. It is something our country needs desperately. They have to go out and get it. But I will take the other side of that argument only because I am mandated to. I am mandated. But they should stay with that argument. Never change. Never change. No planes. No energy. When the wind stops blowing, that is the end of your electric. Let us hurry up. [PERSON], is the wind blowing [DATE]? I'd like to watch television, darling. No, but it is true. So the Great Tariff Debate of [DATE] and then we had so much money we could do whatever we wanted. We built forces up that were incredible. Then, in [DATE], they ended tariffs, okay? They ended tariffs. Somebody got stupid and they ended tariffs. They said, Oh, it is okay for other nations to come in. I will not use a certain words because it is not politically but everybody knows the word I'd love to use. Should I use it? I will not do it. Our great First Lady always said, Do not use certain words, please. I said, But the audience wanted me to do it. She said, Do not do it. And the problem is, if I do do that, they will not put the little preamble that we just went through. They will just use the word, and they will said, Is not that terrible. So I will not use it. I have learned. Because with the fake news if you tell a joke, if you are sarcastic, if you are having fun with the audience, if you are on live television with [CARDINAL] of people and [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] people in an arena, and if you say something like, [GPE], please, if you can, get us [PERSON] emails. Please, [GPE], please. Please get us the emails. Please! So everybody is having a good time. I am laughing, we are all having fun. And then that fake [ORG] and others say, He asked [GPE] to go get the emails. Horrible. I mean, I thought like, [DATE], I am watching and they are talking about [CARDINAL] of the points. He asked [GPE] for the emails. These people are sick. And I am telling you, they know the game. They know the game, and they play it dirty dirtier than anybody has ever played the game. Dirtier than it is ever been played. But the thing that we have done is very special. Because, on trade, and because of tariffs and I know there are people in [ORG] and people really, even conservatives good conservatives they do not like tariffs. I am not liking or not liking. The minimum, the greatest negotiating tool in the history of our country. Do you think [GPE] would be sending their top representatives over? Right now, [GPE] is paying [PERCENT] tariff on [MONEY] worth of technology goods. I was then going to charge them [PERCENT] on [MONEY]. Not like [MONEY] that is a lot. This is [CARDINAL] with [MONEY] billion. [CARDINAL]. So but I was nice, because we are having a very strong negotiation, which if it were not for tariffs and I tell this to President [PERSON]; this is nothing to hide. I would never be talking like this because, in theory, it could hurt your negotiating position. But in my case, it cannot , because it is true. I was nice, and I left it at [PERCENT] on [MONEY]. And here is the beauty: We have lost so much money with [GPE] [MONEY] a year. And on trade, it is such a disaster; it is [MONEY] a year. [GPE] just [CARDINAL] country. We lose with everybody, almost. But [GPE] is [CARDINAL] country. [MONEY], for [DATE]. So the beauty is this: I have [MONEY] more to put tariffs on. The numbers are staggering. [MONEY], right now, are pouring into our [ORG]. And for those of you that have not done the research, if you look, of [PERCENT], our country as it is turned out, because it is now been on there for a long while. Our and I am in no rush because I am fine with it. I am fine with it. Of the [CARDINAL] points, we have paid for [CARDINAL] points, and [GPE] has paid for [CARDINAL] points. Okay? [CARDINAL]. That is what the numbers are. It is very simple. You know, everyone said, Oh, it is a tax on our It is not really. And what [GPE] and other countries do sometimes is they will subsidize it. So the tax really is incredible. But what it is, beyond everything else, I can negotiate. But then you have senators and a few congressman, but not [PERSON]. Where is the great [PERSON]? He is here someplace. Man, has he been good. [PERSON] and [PERSON], and I want to name every one of those [CARDINAL] people. Because we do have a lot. I want to name every damn one of them. They have been incredible. They have been fighting. And I just see [PERSON] in the audience. They have been fighting with [PERSON], much more important. His wife is incredible. What an asset. He would be nowhere without her. Right? But they fight so hard on this witch hunt, this phony deal that they put together; this phony thing that now looks like it is dying. So they do not have anything with [GPE]. There is no collusion. So now they go and morph into, Let us inspect every deal he is ever done. We are going to go into his finances. We are going to check his deals. We are going to check These people are sick. They are sick. I saw little [PERSON] [DATE]. No, it is the first time. He went into a meeting and he said, We are going to look into his finances. I said, Where did that come from? He always talked about [GPE] collusion with [GPE]. The collusion delusion. So now we are waiting for a report, and we will find out whether or not, and who we are dealing with. We are waiting for a report by people that were not elected. We had think of this: We had the greatest election in all fairness, I used to hear [PERSON]. This was now greater than the election of [PERSON]. People say that. No, people say it. I am not saying it. Right? This was the equivalent or greater. You know, they used to go to [PERSON], when I first started. This is [PERSON]. Then we started really doing well, and they were coming from everywhere to vote. Those red hats and white ones. The key is in the color. The key is what it says. Make [GPE] Great Again, is what it says. Right? Right? But we had the greatest of all time. Now we have people that lost. And unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions, and they leave people for a long time that should not be there. And, all of a sudden, they are trying to take you out with bullshit. Okay? With bullshit. Now, [PERSON] never received a vote, and neither did the person that appointed him. And as you know, the Attorney General says, I am going to recuse myself. I am going to recuse. And I said, why the hell did not he tell me that before I put him in? How do you recuse yourself? But the person that appointed [PERSON] never received a vote. [PERSON] put [CARDINAL] of the angriest [NORP] in the history of our country on the commission. Now, how do you do that? These are angry, angry people. You take a look at them. [CARDINAL] of them was involved with [ORG], running it. Another one has perhaps the worst reputation of any human being I have ever seen. All killers. In fact, it would've been actually better for them if they put [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL], and [PERSON] can do whatever he wants anyway, which he will probably do. But we have conflicts. I had a nasty business transaction with [PERSON] a number of years ago. I said, why is not that mentioned? He wanted the job as [ORG] Director. I mean, these are things that are out there; they know it. Why is not that and I did not give it to him. Why is not that mentioned? [PERSON] Lyin' [PERSON] is his best friend. [PERSON] is his best friend. And those are a few of the conflicts. Other than that, it is wonderful. So so everybody is waiting. I thought of it [TIME], [PERSON]. And I heard you made an incredible speech and statement [DATE]. [PERSON]. I heard it was incredible. And I was on the way. But I will see it later. I guarantee I will be watching it later. I have [CARDINAL] of the great inventions in history. It is called TiVo. I think it is actually better than television, because television is practically useless without TiVo, right? But I will be watching it later, [PERSON]. But people that got no votes. But I heard [TIME], President [PERSON] is waiting for the [PERSON] report. I said, wait [TIME], let me get this straight. So the Attorney General recuses himself, and I do not fire him. No obstruction. That is the other thing: If you use your right, if you use your power, if you use Article 2, it is called obstruction. But only for [PERSON]. For nobody else. So the Attorney General is weak and ineffective, and he does not do what he should've done. Somebody that never got a vote writes a powerful letter horrible about [PERSON]. Every single [NORP] said [PERSON] should be fired, or worse, if possible. Every [NORP] said everybody in fact, when I fired [PERSON], I said, You know First Lady I said, [PERSON], I am doing something [DATE]. I am doing it because it really has to be done. He is bad. He is a bad, bad he is a bad, bad guy. That is been proven now with all of the emails and the texts. I am doing something that has to be done. But you know the good news? It is going to be bipartisan. It is going to be so popular, it is going to be bipartisan. Every [NORP] hates him. Every [NORP] hates him. He did a horrible job at the [ORG]. Speak to the real agents, the real people. Because the people in the [ORG] are incredible people not the sleaze on top. And I said to the First Lady I said, But you know the good news? The good news is that this is going to be so bipartisan. Everyone is going to love it. So we fire [PERSON]. And [PERSON] who called for his resignation many times [PERSON], I believe [DATE] because he still has not gotten over getting his ass kicked, okay? I believe [DATE] called for his resignation. [DATE]. [PERSON], the great genius of campaigns. He called for the [PERSON] resignation. Others almost every, I would say. [PERSON], would you say virtually every [NORP], virtually every I cannot think of anybody that said he is doing a good job. So I said to [PERSON], [PERSON], the good news, this will be a popular thing. And I fire a bad cop. I fire a dirty cop. And all of a sudden, the [NORP] say, How dare he fire him. How dare he do this. And that is where we are, folks. That is where we are. We are in this swamp of [GPE], D.C. But you know what? We are winning, and they are not. We are winning. So, just to finish and I will tell you, [PERSON] is loving this. He is saying, This is a lot more than we paid for. You know, normally you read a few pages and you say, Bye, folks. But you know what I like about this? Number [CARDINAL], I am in love, and you are in love. We are all in love together. We have done something that nobody has ever done. Right? It is easy. No, it is easy. You know, a great friend of mine from [GPE], he is a stone-cold killer. He is a brutal man. He is actually not even a good friend of mine because he'd turn on me in [TIME] if it was . But he is a very rich guy. And he said, What are you going to speak about [DATE]? Like, what are you going to speak? I said, I do not know. I do not know. He said, I just heard that you have the biggest crowd in the history of [ORG]. They are all over. By the way, not only in this giant room. They are in many hotel rooms all over the place. You are just better at real estate than they are. True. But this guy you all know his name very rich guy. And he has a problem with a thing called public speaking. If he has to speak to [CARDINAL] people, he chokes. He cannot breathe. You know, juh-juh. Are you okay? He kills people for a living meaning mentally and financially but if there is like an audience of [CARDINAL], it is like augh. So he said to me, How the hell do you do that? And I said, It is easy. And the reason it is easy I really mean this there is so much love in this room, it is easy to talk. You can talk your heart out. You really could. There is love in this room. You can talk your heart out. It is easy. It is easy. It is easy. And we have had that from [DATE] I came down with your First Lady on the escalator in [FAC]. It is been easy. And you know what? We never had an empty seat. We went out and helped [PERSON]. We went out and helped so many people. And I will tell you what: If we did not do those [CARDINAL] rallies and it was not easy. When you are doing rallies with [CARDINAL] 000 people in [GPE], we had [CARDINAL] 000 people sign up. We used the [ORG] arena; it holds [CARDINAL]. [CARDINAL] were outside. We were sending notices, Please do not come. That is a little different. Usually, people are begging. Well, yeah, like can somebody come? We never had an empty seat. Of course, [ORG] a guy named [PERSON] he wrote an article, some arena No, listen to this. He wrote an article. He got there [TIME]. He took pictures of an empty arena. He then put out a note something to the effect, Not very good crowd size, Mr. President. And I never saw it because I do not follow the guy. But [CARDINAL] of people that were in that arena that was packed with [CARDINAL] people outside that could not get in he got there [TIME] early because he does not fly private. You know. And maybe it is because of the carbon footprint. You think maybe that is it? Maybe. Must be the carbon footprint. He just does not want private. But he got there [TIME]. And, you know, the place had not started taking in people. They were not going to take them in. So there were virtually nobody. And, you know, whatever it was [CARDINAL] when you have nobody, it is a little scary-looking. So he took pictures. And you know who really got even? Our people. Because they were incensed. We had people sitting on the stairwells. We had people sitting in every seat. I do not think we have had an empty seat since we announced. And from the day we came down the escalator, I really do not believe we have had an empty seat at any arena, at any stadium. It is been an incredible thing. And that is why I say this has never, ever happened before, and now we have to verify it in [DATE] with an even bigger victory. And, by the way, just to finish that story, the great [PERSON] and [ORG], who is incredible, sitting right here [ORG], thank you. They always say you know, they are good people, right? Much better than I am. They always say, Do not bring it up. Do not fight. Do not fight. Everyone understands. I said, They do not understand. If I do not explain it, how are they going to understand? So remember the arena [CARDINAL], right? And then it was shown. And [ORG] had to do and this particular writer had to do a I thought he was going to get fired. I mean, if that were a conservative, he would've been fired on the spot. He would've been humiliated for what he did. Because it was fake news. Nobody was in the arena. There were [CARDINAL] outside but they had not opened the gates yet. They did the same thing at our big inauguration speech. You take a look at those crowds. And I watched [CARDINAL] of the [TIME] shows that are ridiculous, how horrible they are, how mean how horrible. And I watched it by mistake. And they showed they showed from [FAC] all the way down. They showed from [FAC] showed there were people. Nobody has ever seen it. The [FAC] down to [FAC] people. But I saw pictures that there were no people. Those pictures were taken [TIME]. Right? And they always mention crowd size. He talks about crowd size. So I am constantly bugging [ORG]. Whenever we have a slow moment, I say, [PERSON] and [PERSON] show them the pictures. Show them. And compare them with what they put on television. Those pictures were taken [TIME]. And remember this also not that [PERSON] would ever do this: But we had fencing all the way down to [FAC]. And it was raining and it was wet, and the grass was wet. And women and men and I consider them totally equal, so I am not going to say it is harder. In fact, it is probably, with the men I know, it is actually easier for the women to make the walk, right? But they had to walk all the way down. They had to walk with high heels, in many cases. They had to walk all the way down to [FAC] and then back. And I looked, and I made a speech, and I said, before I got on I said to the people that were sitting next to me, I have never seen anything like this. Look at that crowd. And it was wide. Wide. We had a crowd I have never seen anything like it. And I have to live I have to live with crowd size. It is all a phony deal. But I saw a picture just the other night of practically no people. It was taken [TIME] before [DATE]. That was [DATE] for us. That was [DATE]. People came from all over. People came from all over. So, [PERSON] said, and [PERSON] said, Sir, it does not matter. Nobody cares. I said, But I care. And people care. People care. So what I am going to do is I will give it to the great one. I will give it to [PERSON]. And I will give him the picture. Then I will show you where they showed, [DATE], an empty field like nobody on it. And you will see the sun. You know, you can see it is very dark, because the sun is like starting to rise, right? And you can have some fun. You are going to get big ratings on your show, I will tell you that. [DATE] [TIME], everybody. [TIME]. Huh? [TIME] right? [DATE] [TIME] at [TIME]. Thank you. I knew that, actually. But thank you. All right, now let us get back to what I am here for. And do not fall asleep. Do not fall asleep, right? Do not fall asleep. You know, somebody said, Oh, the speech you made, sir, the State of the Union speech was incredible. They said it was incredible. They said that was so great. And I said I said I did; I got great reviews, even from some of the really bad ones out there. Of course, by [TIME], they had to change because the head people called up, What are you doing? A lot of it is not the people on television, you know. A lot of it is their bosses which someday we are going to have to figure out why, [PERSON], why that is. Because, you know, if you are building a great country, you have the best employment and unemployment numbers we have ever had. More people are working [DATE] in [GPE] than ever before in the history of our country. And you say, why are they upset by that? Why? Why are they upset by that? We have slashed [CARDINAL] pages of job-killing regulations from [ORG]. That is an all-time record in the history of [GPE], even by Presidents there for [DATE], and in [CARDINAL] case more. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in [NORP] history. And we got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big deal. Which should lead to the ending of the disaster known as Obamacare. It should. The great state of [GPE] has a case, and it was literally based on the individual mandate. Now that it is gone, I do not know how they rule against it. Now we will have to find out. But that'll soon be up in [ORG] of [GPE], I hope. And we are going to see what happens. And then we are going to get together with the [NORP] and come up with really great healthcare, okay? Really great healthcare. And of the other things we did in our tax package is [ORG]. Perhaps the largest field in the world oil and gas. I got it approved. And I did not want to get it approved for a certain reason, because I thought somebody treated me very badly. Very badly. Do not get that vote very often. And I said, you know, I do not want to get it. Then I get a call from a friend of mine, and he is in the oil business. He is not asking for anything. He said but he really is a knowledgeable guy when it comes to oil and gas. He said to me, Hey and they all call me Mr. President. I have friends that, for [DATE], Hey, [PERSON], how you doing? Hey, [PERSON]. I love you, [PERSON]. For [DATE]. Now they call, Mr. [PERSON], sir. How are you? I have a friend a very rich guy [PERSON], in [GPE]. A builder. A good builder. He calls me all my life, Hey, [PERSON], how you doing? I have known this guy so long from [DATE]. It is true. Hi, [PERSON], how you doing? How is everything? And now I get a call [DATE], Mr. [PERSON], how are you, sir? How are you? I said, [PERSON], lighten up. Lighten up. Call me '[PERSON]'. [PERSON], call me '[PERSON]'. You have known me for I do not want to say, because I do not want my wife to hear the number. But it is true. Actually, that is true. That is actually true. [PERSON] came up; he said, I have known your husband for [DATE]. I said, Do not say that. I say, Say [DATE]. Do not say [DATE]. But I said, [PERSON], call me '[PERSON]', like you always do. Call me '[PERSON]'. Okay. Okay, [PERSON]. Okay. He gets his breath. Uh-huh. [TIME] Mr. President That is called respect for the office, right? Maybe that is a good thing, right? Many many of my friends. And that was not in the script either, [PERSON]. But we are renegotiating, right now, horrible trade deals that we are cracking down and we are really doing a number cracking down on countries that cheat, and standing up for the [NORP] worker for the first time in [DATE]. [DATE]. Our workers have been treated horribly. A country announces they are closing their plant in [GPE] or [GPE] or [GPE] they are closing. They are closing a plant; they are going to move to [GPE]. They are going to move to [GPE]. They are going to move someplace else. They fire all their workers. And then they sell their cars, no tax; just make them in [GPE], sell them back to here. No tax, no nothing. [DATE] are all gone, folks. They are all gone. They are all gone. And in the new deal with [GPE] and [GPE], called the [ORG], it is very, very hard prohibitively hard for a company to fire its [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] workers and move to [GPE] or some other location. It is now a very costly they can do it, I guess, if they want. But it is costly. It is painful. It used to be almost I said I used to I have been talking about this for a long time. I used to say it is almost like we are giving them an incentive to leave our country. Again, I am for [GPE] first. That was not for [GPE] first. And we have great companies that are now moving back to our country. They are coming back in. They are coming back in. And, by the way, you know I am building the wall. We are finishing the wall. We got a lot of money. It is in the thing. But and there will be some people in the room that do not like this. We are down to [PERCENT] unemployment the lowest number in a long time. But think of this: I got all these companies moving in. They need workers. We have to bring people into our country to work these great plants that are opening up all over the place. This was not necessarily what I was saying during the campaign because I never knew we would be as successful as we have been. Companies are roaring back into our country, and now we want people to come in. We need workers to come in, but they have got to come in legally, and they have got to come in through merit, merit, merit. They have got to come in through merit. They have to be people that can help us. They have to be people that can love our country, not hate our country. We have people in [ORG] right now, we have people in [ORG] that hate our country. And you know that. And we can name every one of them if they want. They hate our country. It is sad. It is very sad. When I see some of the things being made, the statements being made, it is very, very sad. Very, very and find out, how did they do in their country? Just ask them, how did they do? Did they do well? Were they succeeding? Just ask that question. Somebody would say, Oh, that is terrible that he brings that up. But that is okay, I do not mind. I will bring it up. How did they do in their country? Not so good. Not so good. But we need workers. We have to bring in workers. [CARDINAL] other thing because we have a lot of people here that are important people in terms of votes. We have some senators. We have some congressmen. When a senator tells us that he is a free trader, so am I. I am a fair trader. I am a free trader. But when a senator said we cannot do tariffs, where we make a fortune, or at a minimum, we are able to use this tremendous power that I found tremendous old stuff. Nobody even knew it existed. I am able to use it, at a minimum, to negotiate great and fair trade deals. They would not even be talking to us because it is so [CARDINAL]-sided. [DATE], we lost [CARDINAL] this for [DATE] [MONEY] on trade. It is not sustainable. You cannot do that. And now we are making great trade deals. But when some of the senators good people; I think they are good people. I just do not understand the thinking. So I say, [GPE] is a very high-tariff nation. They charge us a lot. When we send a motorcycle to [GPE], it is [PERCENT] tariff. They charge [PERCENT]. When [GPE] sends a motorcycle to us, we brilliantly charge them nothing. So I want a reciprocal tax, or at least I want to charge a tax. It is called a mirror tax, but it is a reciprocal tax. Now, here is what I do not understand: I have had a lot of people [PERSON]. I said, [PERSON] it is not his thing necessarily. It is not the thing that he is most adept at. But he is adept and he is smart. I said, [PERSON], if they charge us [CARDINAL], I'd like a reci- If they charge us, we charge them. He goes, That makes sense to me. And then he gets on to judiciary and things that, frankly, he likes and finds very interesting. But he is a smart guy, and he said I will never forget. It took me [TIME], which is a long time. I did a bad description. It is so easy. They charge [CARDINAL]; we charge nothing. Now we have reciprocal, so it is [CARDINAL]. But what happens now, for those that really think about tariffs and do not like tariffs for whatever reason might be and that is okay. What is going to happen is, in many cases, instead of [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL], you are going to have [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL], so you will not have any tariff. Okay? It is going to happen. That is going to happen. But you have to you have to start working on some of the senators that say I cannot approve this deal. I say, You know what? I want to just charge [GPE] as an example, I am using it. But [GPE] is a very high-tariff nation. I mean, nobody nobody knows it because nobody knows what they are doing in [GPE]. But [GPE] is a very, very high-tariff nation, and they charge tremendous tremendous numbers. So they charge [CARDINAL]. So I say, I am not going to charge [CARDINAL], but I am going to charge [PERCENT]. And I hear this turmoil in the [ORG] because we are charging [CARDINAL]. So I call a couple of the guys up. I say, [PERSON], listen, they are charging us [CARDINAL] for the exact same product. I want to charge them [CARDINAL]. And I feel so foolish charging [CARDINAL] because it should be [CARDINAL]. But I am doing [CARDINAL] only because of you. I want to get your support. Sir, that is not free trade. Where do these people come from? Where do they come from? Where? Where do they come from? I need your help. I need your help the voters' help. Where do they come from? So it can only be [CARDINAL] of [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] things. Number [CARDINAL], I know they are very smart people. I know they are. And I even like some of them. But they are smart. So we take that out of the equation. So even and I know they do not have evil intentions. And the other thing could be, I guess, maybe you know, these companies are all owned by people, and these people are very generous. Campaign contributions they are very, very generous people. Can that be possible? I do not think so. I hope not. Because we are talking about our country. We cannot allow a country to charge [PERCENT] and we get nothing for the same exact product. For [CARDINAL] thing, they do not respect us. They think we are stupido. They do not respect us. But let me tell you something: The world respects our country again. They respect us. And [GPE] is now booming like never before. Other countries are doing very poorly. Other countries are doing very poorly, and that makes it even harder for us to be successful. Plus, we have a gentleman that likes raising interest rates in the [ORG]. We have a gentleman that loves quantitative tightening in the [ORG]. We have a gentleman that likes a very strong dollar in the [ORG]. So with all of those things and we want a strong dollar, but let us be reasonable. You understand that. With all of that, we are doing great. Can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were? There is no inflation, essentially. There is no inflation. Can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were? If we did not do quantitative tightening, taking money out of the market? If we did not do quantitative and this would lead to a little bit lower dollar. A little bit. I want a strong dollar, but I want a dollar that is going to be great for our country, not a dollar that is so strong that it is prohibitive for us to be dealing with other nations and taking their business. Since the election, we have created a number that if I would have said during the campaign, the fake news just back there would have said this is crazy. [CARDINAL] new jobs, including over, now, [CARDINAL] 000 beautiful, brand-new manufacturing jobs that were never going to come back to our country. These are jobs that were never coming back to our country. Remember? Not to talk badly about the other administration, but if that theory went forward with Crooked [PERSON] winning the election, instead of being up [PERCENT] with the stock market, you would have been down [PERCENT]. It was heading down. It was going to be a disaster. We have [CARDINAL] [NORP] that have been lifted off of food stamps. Nobody ever thought that was possible. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest in [DATE]. And [NORP] and you have heard me say this many times [NORP], [NORP] unemployment rates are at their all-time historic lows. And [NORP] income has reached an all-time high. So when I am on the debate stage with [CARDINAL] of these maniacs I mean, trains to [GPE]. How do you get to Europe? We have not figured that one out yet. We do not use airplanes anymore. You saw what I am doing in [GPE], right? They have a fast train. The fast train goes from [GPE] to [GPE]. It is over budget by [MONEY], so they have a great idea the new governor; nice guy. Yeah, he is a nice guy. When I am with him face to face, nice. When he speaks about me, not so nice. But face to face, he loves me. He called me up. He said, You are a great President. You are doing a great job. He actually did, [DATE], [DATE]. So he will probably deny it, but check the phone records at [ORG]. Everybody else does. Check them. Check them. Check them. Called me up [DATE]. I think they need some forest money, because honestly, the management of the forests is very bad and that is one of the problems they have. I said, You got to get those forests. We cannot keep spending [CARDINAL] and losing [CARDINAL] of lives, more importantly. Got to clean it up. It is called management. When a tree falls, you cannot let the environmentalist say you cannot take that tree out. It becomes like a matchstick, that tree. It hits a flame, it goes up. The leaves every once in a while, you have to remove the leaves because they are so a guy smoking a cigarette, he throws it away, he does not mean it. The thing catches on fire and we lose [QUANTITY] and people are killed. You got to have management. But he called me up [DATE], recently let us say [DATE] or so. He said, I just want to tell you you are a great President and you are one of the smartest people I have ever met. That is what he said. Now, that is what he said. Will he admit it? No, I doubt it. But that is what he said. And you are doing a great job. And then he did start talking about, in all fairness, additional money for the fire, which is it is okay. That is okay. We have great talks. I mean, I like him. [PERSON]. I like him. Nice guy. But they say things you know, politicians, they say things to your face, and then you see [DATE] they are giving a news conference just like, where did that guy come from? Where did he come from? But everyone in this great country, right now, because of our great new economy, is doing well except, of course, for the Never Trumpers. But they are on mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Mouth to mouth. Mouth to mouth. They are hanging in. A couple of them. I mean, these guys have gotten me wrong. Not only Never Trumpers. You have Never Trumpers; you have certain hardline. They are basically dishonest people because, look, let us face it: Whether you like me or not if my name is [PERSON] instead of [PERSON], and if you told him I put in [CARDINAL] federal judges it'll soon be [CARDINAL] federal judges and [CARDINAL] [ORG] judges. And [CARDINAL] appellate division judges. That we have got the best economy maybe in our history. That we have got the best employment numbers and unemployment numbers in our history. That we have cut more regulations in [DATE] than any President has ever done, whether it is for [CARDINAL] or beyond. That we have taken care of our military with [MONEY]. Think of that. Think of what we did. Think of what we did with our military. Think of the numbers that we have for our military. We have numbers nobody has ever heard of these numbers before. And you know, part of the problem that we have because I am a cost cutter. But and you are all cost cutters. But we have to take care of our military. We have to. [MONEY] we spent. And that was [DATE]. And then [DATE], [MONEY]. Now, I have no choice. I'd like to spend much less. [PERSON] was spending much less but our military was being depleted. He was fighting in endless wars; they'd never end. And, by the way, as of probably [DATE] or [DATE], we will actually have [PERCENT] of the caliphate in [GPE]. [PERCENT]. [PERCENT]. And we will leave a small group of guys and gals. But we want to bring our people back home. We want to bring our people back home. It is time. Been in these wars. We were going to be in [GPE] for [DATE]. We ended up [DATE]. This fighting they just like to fight. We want to fix our country. We want to fix our bridges, our highways, our roads, our schools. We want to fix our country up. It is time. It is time. But I was told by a general, who I had to fire I said, General, how long before we get [PERCENT] of the caliphate? He said, Sir, [DATE]. I said, I cannot take it [DATE]. And then I flew to [GPE]; first time I left [ORG] because I stayed in [ORG] for [DATE] and [DATE] because I wanted the [NORP] to get back from their vacations from [GPE] and these other places. And I figured it would look good if I stayed in [ORG] so that you people all love me and vote for me, okay? I figured it would look good. I figured it would look good. So I stayed in [FAC]. And I will tell you what: I was there I told my wife, Go to [GPE]. Enjoy your [DATE]. I stayed for [DATE]. I said I mean, I was in [FAC] for a long time. [DATE]. [DATE]. I had cabin fever in [FAC]. But if you have got to have cabin fever, that is the place to do it, okay? But I was there, I do not know, for a number of months, through [DATE]. I spent [DATE] all by myself. Do not cry. All it was me and [CARDINAL] men and women outside with machine guns. I never saw so many beautiful-looking machine guns. I'd look at that equipment and I'd say, Man They sit in the trees. They sit on the lawn. I told people, I am in this mess you know, people do not know how big [FAC]. First of all, it is one of the most beautiful places in the world. It is really I made a lot of money with luxury. This building is [CARDINAL] which, of course, when President [PERSON] comes, I say [DATE], like it is old. To him, that is like a brand-new house in [GPE]. In [GPE], they go back they go back [DATE]. So that is that is like a new that is like a new residence. But I sat in [FAC] for [DATE] and [DATE], except I took [DATE] off. I flew to a lovely place called [GPE], and I flew at [TIME] and I got there at [TIME]. And I said to myself, this is interesting, because they say, Sir, all of the lights in the plane, sir, are going off. I say, Why? Because we are getting ready to land. We are [TIME] out. I said, What about the shades? Well, we want it better than that. May be like . So we turned the lights off, put the shades down. This is a big seven forty Air Force One. And we are landing, and I go up and I look. And I have landed; I like to sit with pilots. I respect people that know what they are doing, and these are the best in the world. I really do. These are the best in the world. And the pilot says, Sir, we are landing in [TIME]. I say, But there is no runway. No, sir, the runway is right up there, sir. I say, I do not see it. I have pretty good vision. At least for my age I have good vision. I guess for my age I have great vision. But I do not have vision like a [DATE] captain. He said, No, it is right up there. I said, I am sorry, Captain, how about this: Should we lift off and try it again? Captain, there is no runway. Anyway he sits right up there and we land. There is practically not lights. These are little pin spots. And I said, think of this: We spent [MONEY] in the Middle East and we cannot land with the lights on [DATE]. How bad is it? No, seriously, how bad is it? How bad is it? [MONEY] and we have to fly in with no lights. But I met some incredible people. I met some incredible people generals. [CARDINAL] of them came from [GPE] the operation in [GPE]. And I was upset with my generals because they were not getting it finished. I want the job done. I want to bring our people back home. It is not fair. And this is why I flew. So I met generals I did not know. General [CARDINAL], general [CARDINAL], general [CARDINAL]. I mean, these generals there is no person in [GPE] that could play the role. These guys are like perfect people. I said, What is your name? Sir, my name is [PERSON]. What the hell kind of a name? I said, [PERSON], like the fruit? He goes, Yes, sir, [PERSON]. What is your last name? [PERSON]. [PERSON]. I said, You got to be kidding me. It is true. [PERSON] I just made him a big star. Just like I did with [PERSON] when I said, We are going to give you a new nickname, because 'Chaos' is not a good nickname. So we changed his name. Called him [PERSON]. But it was not working too well. [PERSON] was not working too well. So what happened is I flew to [GPE]. I wanted to meet the people on the site, because I learn more sometimes from soldiers, what is going on, than I do from generals. I do. I hate to say it. And I tell that to the generals all the time. But I did not have to go there. I did not have to go there. Because I meet and I land in this airport, the most incredible thing. We must have spent [MONEY] building it. It is one of the reasons I do not want to leave [GPE] so fast. I said, Well, how do we leave this thing? So I have [PERSON] and [CARDINAL] other generals, colonels, sergeants. And I said, Bring the cameras. I am going to make a movie. This is the most incredible thing. And I said to the generals, Listen, we got to get out. I want to know why is it going to take [DATE] to knock off [PERCENT] [PERCENT] [PERCENT], which is what we had left. It will not , sir. And I said, Tell me why it will not . It will not , sir. If we attack them in a different manner, we can do it much faster. Okay, General [PERSON], how fast can Sir, we can have it totally finished in [DATE]. I said, [DATE]? I was told [DATE]. [DATE]? That is right, sir. We are only hitting them from a temporary base in [GPE]. But if you gave us permission, we could hit them from the back, from the side, from all over from the base that you are right on, right now, sir. They will not know what the hell hit them. They will not know what the hell hit them, sir. And I said, Why did not my other generals tell me that? Why did not they tell me that? I said, Did you tell them that? Not our place to say it, sir. They come in from [GPE], sir. We have to take orders. You are the first one to ask us our opinion. It is true. It is true. True. True. So I went back and I said, I am going to get back to you soon, [PERSON]. I think you are great. I like you, [PERSON]. But I did say I said, Well, hey, listen, we are in [GPE]. Is not that very far away from I was here in a very short time, sir. I flew right in. Of course, he is taking a plane that goes [QUANTITY], you know. But incredible. What you learn from being on the site my father was a builder. He always used to say, Nobody ever got rich by sitting behind their desk. It is true. It is true. He'd say, You got to be on this site. You got to be with the contractors. You got to see if they are ripping you off. You have got to collect every nail that is dropped, every piece of wood. You can sell it. You got to be on the site. You got to see while they are building, while they are under construction, is that wall straight or if it is crooked. And you have to fix it before they build it, not after they build it, when you rip everything down. True. You do not get rich by sitting behind a desk. So I did not want to do that. And I am in [ORG] and I was lonely. I said, Let us go to [GPE]. And I had a hell of a meeting in [GPE]. And I will tell you, those generals not just [PERSON], General [PERSON]. Those generals were great. They were great. They knew their stuff. They were gung-ho. And it is true I mean, you talk central casting. These guys you could not I mean, it is incredible. They had a master sergeant. I could take him right now, bring him to [GPE], make a military movie, and he is the star of the movie. That happened once before, you know. That did happen once before. Remember? They brought a man in a sergeant, a drill sergeant to teach some actor how to be a drill sergeant. The drill sergeant was so incredible that he ended up starring in the movie, and he should have gotten the Academy Award, by the way, but he did not . That is because [GPE] discriminates against our people. You know the movie I am talking about, right? What was that movie? You know the movie. But while we are making great strides, and our country is doing as well and maybe, in many ways, better than it is ever done before [NORP] lawmakers are now embracing socialism. They want to replace individual rights with total government domination. [DATE], [CARDINAL] [NORP] in [ORG] signed up for a socialist takeover of [NORP] healthcare. Their radical government-run plan if you call it that would lead to colossal tax increases increases like you have never seen before and take away private coverage from [CARDINAL] [NORP]. And we have some great private coverage, and we have initiated some incredible plans, like the new cooperative plan, where you get better insurance than [ORG] for a fraction of the cost. But perhaps nothing is more extreme than the [NORP]' plan to completely takeover [NORP] energy and completely destroy [GPE]'s economy through their new [MONEY] Green New Deal. Under the Green New Deal which somebody described as a high school term paper written by a poor student it is true. It is true. Who would believe it? It so it is so bad. But I do not I will be honest with you, folks. I said you know, it is [DATE] [TIME], and I said, [PERSON], should we do a little more, like, spend time? He said, Yeah, would you do that? By the way, everybody okay? I have not seen anybody leaving. I have not seen anybody. I know [CARDINAL] thing: If [PERSON] gets up and leaves, I will finish very quickly, because then I know. But I have not seen anyone leaving. Nobody has left. I watch those doors. Because a lot of times a lot of times well, one time, the press said people left. Yeah, you know where they went? To the bathroom. And then they came back. [CARDINAL] people. They showed [CARDINAL] empty seats in a stadium of [CARDINAL]. They showed [CARDINAL] empty seats. The people left right in front of me, and I said, Oh, man, maybe this is not a good job I am doing. Then they came back. They went to the bathroom. And a certain fake news deal showed a picture on the front page of these [CARDINAL] empty seats. They said [PERSON] had empty seats. We never have empty seats. The Green New Deal would completely abolish the [NORP] oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear power industries, of which we are now the leader in the world. We are the biggest now in the world because of moves that I have made. Happened over [DATE], by the way. And we are trying to speed up pipelines in [GPE], which would have taken [DATE]. We think we are almost very close to getting them approved. When that happens, we will go probably [PERCENT]. We need pipeline approval. We are going to have it very quickly. It would have taken it was going to be a 14- to 15-year process. We should have it done. We will pick up [PERCENT] more. Their plan would remove every gas-powered car from [NORP] roads. Oh, that is not so bad. They want you to have [CARDINAL] carinstead of [CARDINAL], and it should be electric, okay? So tell people, no more cars. No more cars. I think the auto industry is not going to do too well under this plan. What do you think, [PERSON]? How is this? Will the auto industry be good? I do not think so. It is not looking good. I think maybe maybe you are going to see some bad stock prices if that passes. It would end air travel. But you will get on a train, do not worry about it. You just have to cross off [PERCENT] of the world. And it would force the destruction or renovation of virtually every existing structure in [GPE]. [GPE] would have to rip down buildings and rebuild them again. I do not think so. This is the craziest plan, and yet I see senators that are there for [DATE] white hair. See, I do not have white hair. I do not have white hair. No, I see these white-haired, longtime senators standing behind this young woman, and she is ranting and raving like a lunatic. And these senators these senators: Yes, I agree with this. Yes, I agree. The crazy female senator from the state of [GPE], the state of [GPE]. Right? She is like she is like a crazed person. What she said about men is so bad. What she said about men is so bad. But she is standing in the hallway. And she did not know too much about the plan because she is you know, she cannot understand that plan. Which probably makes her smart, actually. Now, this is the senator from [GPE], and they are saying to her, What do you think? Well, I do not know how people are going to get to [GPE], but I am in favor of the plan. I do not get it. I do not get it. I do not get it. So she is in favor of the plan, but you will not be able to get to well, we can take boats, I guess. We will go back to boats. This is the new [NORP] platform for the and I do not want to talk them out of it. I do not . I do not . I swear I do not . This is a killer. I got to get off this subject. I want them to embrace this plan. I want them to go and sell this plan. I just want to be the [NORP] that runs against them for that. I am going to regret this speech. This speech should have been delivered [DATE], not now, damn it. Because they are going to grab out together, and they are going to say, You know, this guy is really laying for us. I should've saved the [PERSON] thing for [DATE]. Because I have destroyed her political career, and now I will not get a chance to run against her, and I would've loved it. We got to you know, I do not want to knock out all of the good stuff and end up with somebody that is actually got talent. That would be terrible. So I do like the Green New Deal. I respect it greatly. It should be part of the dialogue of the next election. And I think it has tremendous promise and tremendous potential for the future of our country. Socialism is not about the environment. It is not about justice. It is not about virtue. Socialism is about [CARDINAL] thing. It is called power for the ruling class. That is what it is. Look at what is happening in [GPE] and so many other places. All of us are here [DATE] because we know that the future does not belong to those who believe in socialism. And I heard, [DATE], a great speech from our Vice President [PERSON], talking about this very subject and talking about it beautifully. The future belongs to those who believe in freedom. I have said it before and I will say it again: [GPE] will never be a socialist country ever. Young [NORP] I love young [NORP]. Speaking of young [NORP] [PERSON], stand up. [PERSON] is getting married. Stand up. You have been incredible. Thank you. Your whole group has been great. You are getting married. Seems like a nice guy to me. Congratulations. You have been so great. Thank you very much, [PERSON]. Thanks. And, [PERSON], what a job you are doing. Where is [PERSON]? Where is [PERSON]? Where is [PERSON]? Because he has done an incredible job. Thank you very much, [PERSON]. But young [NORP] like you are leading the revival of [NORP] liberty, sovereignty, and self-determination in the face of left-wing intolerance. The anger the unbelievable anger I see it [DATE]. Fortunately, for you, it is mostly pointed at me. You have the courage to speak the truth, to do what is right, and to fight for what you believe, and keep doing it. We reject oppressive speech codes, censorship, political correctness, and every other attempt by the hard left to stop people from challenging ridiculous and dangerous ideas. These ideas are dangerous. Instead, we believe in free speech, including online and including on campus. And, by the way, there is a young gentleman with us [DATE]. There is a young gentleman. I turned on my television [DATE], and I saw somebody that was violently punched in the face. Violently punched. And I said that is disgusting. By a bully I'd like to do a lot of things. But, of course, we would never do that. Because if I ever said violence, they would say, [PERSON] attacked. No, no, no. Just for the media: I am sure he is a lovely young man; just had a little temper tantrum. I have been there before with those people. I do not want to do it again. So, the man's name is [PERSON]. Where is [PERSON]? Where is he? Where is he? [PERSON], come up here. Come up here. [PERSON]: Thank you. Thank you. So, at [ORG], we are committed to making campuses great again. And I thank you so much for bringing me up here to let me speak. It is great it is great that I am being recognized, and but there is so many conservative students across the country who are facing discrimination, harassment, and worse, if they dare to speak up on campus. So I am glad that we could we could, you know, bring this to the forefront. And I'd just like to say, you know, if these socialist progressives had their way, they would put our Constitution through the paper shredder in a heartbeat. So, you know, it is as important now than ever the work at [ORG] and [ORG] you know, exposing these liberal abuses to the public it is as important now as ever. And these students these students do it because they have a love of our nation and freedom, and frankly, a love for you, Mr. President. I was going to call him, but I do not have to now. I see him here. But here is the [CARDINAL] thing: I learned a number of things. First of all, he can take a punch. If [PERSON] could take a punch, he can take a punch. Because you were not going to go down no matter how that was a hell of a hard punch. He was a strong guy. But you know what? You have got yourself a great lawyer. I know your lawyer. She is a great lawyer. Just tell her to do me a favor: Sue him. But he is probably got nothing, but sue him forever. But sue the college, the university. And maybe sue the state. Ladies and gentlemen, he took a hard punch in the face for all of us. Remember that. He took a punch for all of us. And we can never allow that to happen. And here is, in closing with [PERSON] here is the good news: He is going to be a very wealthy young man. That is okay. Go get 'em, [PERSON]. [DATE] I am proud to announce that I will be very soon signing an executive order requiring colleges and universities to support free speech if they want federal research dollars. If they want our dollars, and we give it to them by the [CARDINAL], they have got to allow people like [PERSON] and many other great young people, and old people, to speak. Free speech. And if they do not , it will be very costly. That'll be signed very soon. [DATE], we are restoring common sense and the timeless values that unite us all. We believe in the Constitution and the rule of law. We believe in the First Amendment right. And we believe in religious liberty. And we believe strongly in the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms which is under siege, folks. They have a lot of plans. It is under siege. Be careful. But I will protect you, I promise you that. I will protect you. Because it all has to come through my office. And we hopefully are going to be here for [DATE], so you are in good shape. We believe in the [NORP] Dream, not in the socialist nightmare. And we believe in the words of our national motto: In God We Trust. [DATE], my presidency will defend [NORP] families. We will defend [GPE]'s workers our great, great cherished workers that now we are taking care of. They are not losing their jobs. We are creating those jobs. We are not letting those companies destroy their lives anymore. We will defend the [NORP] way of life, and we will always defend [GPE]'s borders. Because without borders, as I have said many times before, we do not have a country. The lawless chaos on our southern border provides a lucrative cash flow to some of the most dangerous criminal organizations on the planet. Deadly cartels constantly [DATE], [DATE] violate our borders to flood our cities with drugs that kill [CARDINAL] of our citizens violently. What are these people talking about when they talk about the border? Keep it open. Keep what open? Have you been there? Have you seen? I just got back. I have been there many times. I see what is happening. I do not like it. But I have to tell you, [ORG], our [ORG] agents, our law enforcement, the job they do and they do not have the backup of a wall, in many cases the job they do is incredible. These ruthless cartels terrorize innocent communities on both sides of the border and spread instability throughout our hemisphere. When I was there [DATE], [CARDINAL] people were killed very close to where I was, on the Rio Grande. Sounds nice, right? The Rio Grande. Rough. Rough stuff. [CARDINAL] people were killed, and they were buried right near where I was standing. And the paper does not write about it. The news does not write about it. In [DATE], [ORG] officers made [CARDINAL] arrests. Think of what that means. Think of that arrests. I am not talking about people coming in. I am talking they went out and arrested [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] people who have criminal records and, in some cases, for murder. Who the hell wants to do that? Thank God they are doing it because I do not want to do it. It is dangerous. It is hard. But they love our country, and they are tough people, but they love our country. Including those charged or convicted of [CARDINAL], 000 assaults, [CARDINAL] sex crimes, [CARDINAL] 000 burglaries, [CARDINAL] kidnappings, and [CARDINAL] violent murders. These are people that [ORG] is going in and getting, and either putting in jail or ideally bringing them back to other countries and letting them put in jail, because we do not want them. We do not want to have to pay for them for [DATE]. You want them to pay a price, but we do not want to have to pay for them for [DATE]. And all the nonsense you hear about the people that come in illegally are far better than the people we have it is not true, folks. Okay? It is false. It is false propaganda. Right? [CARDINAL] recent study from [ORG] found that illegal aliens are incarcerated at [CARDINAL] times the rate of legal residents. Those are the numbers. And if you look at prison population in federal prisons, these federal prisons are the number is staggering. The number of illegals far, far, far greater than any proportion of our population. But you do not hear that; you hear like these people are the greatest people in the world. Just ask the Angel Moms how good are there. Those great Angel Moms who were treated so badly so badly. Incredible people. But the simple reality is that every crime committed by an illegal immigrant is a crime that should never have happened in the first place. The border crisis is also a heartbreaking humanitarian tragedy. Vicious coyotes, smugglers, and human traffickers prey upon innocent women and children. [CARDINAL] in [CARDINAL] women is sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north. When I ran for president, my first speech, I mentioned the word rape. The press went after me; I could not believe it. I said, Will it be like this always? The answer was yes. It even got worse. From [DATE], I mention the word rape. If you look at that speech, that was so innocent compared to what is really happening. That was a very innocent speech compared to the real facts. Illegal immigration is not compassionate. It is inhumane, unjust, and cruel. The media fights me on this, but I say it: Mothers who love their daughters, when their daughters are getting ready to make that [QUANTITY] trek up through [GPE] and frankly, I wish [GPE] would stop them at their northern border, at our I wish [GPE] would stop them. Because you know, they have a border. They call it their southern border. It is [QUANTITY] down from our southern border. I wish [GPE] would stop them. But they have their own difficulties. Frankly, I understand that. We are working along well with them. And they are doing a lot of things to help us with asylum and other elements of what we are doing. But mothers, who love their daughters, give them massive amounts of birth control pills because they know their daughters are going to be raped on the way up to our southern border. Think of that. True story, told to me by [ORG]. So true and so sad. Think of how evil that is. Think of how bad it is. Those caravans you look at those caravans, and some are phenomenal people. But in those caravans you have stone-cold killers. You had the interview done by some innocent person who I think is actually back there now. And what is it that you want asylum for? Why are you coming to [GPE]? Uh, murder. She goes, What? Murder. I mean, what is going on is incredible. And when those [NORP] are formed, do you think those countries that we used to give a lot of money to I have cut it way back. I have cut it way back. [GPE], [GPE], [GPE]. Do you think they are giving us, as we say, their best and their finest? Oh, let us send our best people up to [GPE]. Let us have our best people go in the caravan so we can give [GPE] our greatest people. No, no, no, no. They give us some very bad people. People with big, long crime records. People with tremendous violence in their past. Murderers, killers, drug dealers, human traffickers. They want to keep their good people because they are smart. It is so sad to see how stupid we have been. [ORG] recently reported apprehending [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] unlawful migrants in [DATE] on [CARDINAL] part of the [GPE] border, [DATE]. Our immigration system is stretched far beyond the breaking point. To confront this national security crisis, [DATE] I declared a national emergency. A national emergency. And when I see these people and they are good people some senators, mostly I tell you, the [ORG] has been fantastic. The [ORG] you know, backing we have had from the [ORG] has really been I am talking about in the last short period of time. There is a lot of spirit in the [ORG], and I think in the [ORG] too, but we are going to have to see because we have a vote coming up. And a lot of people talk about precedent. Precedent. That if we do this, the [NORP] will use national emergency powers for something that we do not want. They are going to do that anyway, folks. The best way to stop that is to make sure that I win the election. That is the best way to stop that. They are going to do it anyway. They will do it anyway. I watch good people, they are friends of mine, We are very concerned with setting precedent. That is precedent not president. Precedent. We are very concerned about setting precedent. I am very concerned with having murderers and drug traffickers, and drugs and drug cartels, pouring into our country. That is what I am concerned about. And the [NORP], they are going to do whatever they do if they get into power, and it will not have a damn thing to do with whether or not we approve our national emergency. Because let me tell you they do not like it when I say it but we are being invaded. We are being invaded by drugs, by people, by criminals. And we have to stop it. And we want people to come in, as I said before, but they have to come in legally and with merit. Previous presidents have used their national emergency power to promote democratic elections in [GPE], to ensure political stability in [GPE], and to defend the sovereignty of [GPE]. And you know what? That is okay. In [GPE] it is good. Fine. Use it. But we need it right here in our country. We have to use it for our country. Many emergency declarations have been used to protect people in faraway nations and distant lands. Now we are protecting, finally, our people. You. Our people. And we are proudly standing with the heroes of [ORG] and [ORG] and law enforcement. Illegal immigration is also deeply unfair to [NORP] workers and taxpayers, including [CARDINAL] of hardworking legal immigrants. If you care about helping immigrants and care about their success, if you care about reducing poverty and raising living standards, then you must support a safe, strong, and very, very secure border. We need an immigration policy that helps all [NORP] thrive, flourish, prosper. We need an immigration policy that is going to be great for our corporations and our great companies. We need an immigration policy where people coming into our country can love our country and love our fellow citizens. And this includes shutting down sanctuary cities. And we want to end catch-and-release. We catch them, we realize they are a criminal, and we have to release them. Think of this: They come onto our land, they put [CARDINAL] foot on our land. We now have to take them through a massive court trial. Who does this? Other countries say, Get the hell out of here. We have to take them through court. So we catch them. We talk to them. If they are criminals, or if they are not, we release them. We say, Come back for a hearing in front of a judge. You know how many judges you need to do this? We have [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] people backlogged. That is the good news. The bad news? Nobody shows up. [PERCENT] of the people come back for a trial. It is insane. Not my fault I inherited this mess, but we are fixing it. We have to end chain migration, and we have to cancel the visa lottery. Every [NORP], no matter where they are born, will benefit from the creation of a lawful immigration system. It is such you talk about an emergency. Our immigration system is so broken, folks. It is so broken. It is so sad to see. It is incompetent. It is laughed at all over the world. We have people pouring in from not just the southern border in [GPE]. From [GPE]. They have a baby on our land. The baby becomes a citizen. Welcome to [GPE] for hopefully [DATE]. Okay? And then the parents come in with the baby because the baby is a citizen. This is like crazy. They used to call it anchor babies but they do not use that term anymore because it does not sound nice. Our laws are so crazy. But one by [CARDINAL], we are finding ways. You know, they call them loopholes. A lot of our laws loopholes. Well, I am finding loopholes to get around the loophole. Okay? Because our [ORG] cannot act. They cannot act. They just cannot act. The [NORP] in [ORG] do not want to touch any of it. [ORG] lottery that is where they put in the names; they put it in a lottery, and you pick, Oh, here is a wonderful person. Wonderful. You know, he killed [CARDINAL] people. Here is here is another wonderful. And then they get in and we say, Gee, that person just came into our country. He just robbed a store and killed somebody. How is that possible? Because they send us the people they do not want. The biggest form of subsidy we give to other nations. Immigration systems that prioritize the admission of those who can support themselves financially and contribute. We want people that can help themselves, that can support themselves. We have people coming in. We support them from [DATE] they come in until [DATE] they die. We cannot do that as a country. We cannot afford to do that as a country. Sadly, on immigration and so many other issues, [NORP] lawmakers have totally abandoned the [NORP] mainstream. But that is going to be good for us in [DATE]. They are embracing open borders, socialism, and extreme late-term abortion. [DATE], lawmakers in [GPE] cheered as they passed legislation to allow babies to be ripped from the womb of their mother right up to the very moment of death. Then, in an act and a statement, the likes of which I do not think I have ever heard, in [GPE], the governor a [NORP] stated that he would allow babies to be born, to be born outside. He would wrap them. He would take care of them. And then he will talk to the mother and the father as to what to be done. And if they did not want the child, who is now outside of the womb long outside of the womb they will execute the baby after birth. They will execute the baby after birth. And that is one many people have never even heard of or thought about. This is a radical agenda by the [NORP]. And when you put something up, as was just put up before the [ORG], everybody on the [NORP] side votes for it. By the way, I have to say [CARDINAL] thing: They are lousy politicians and they have lousy policy. They have policy I could never sell if I wanted to. But but big but they always stick together. And the [NORP] do not remember that. Remember that. They always stick together. They vote in blocs. They have [CARDINAL]. We had a tremendous victory. We were given no credit. I cannot go and campaign for all of the people in the [ORG]. Too many. And guys like [PERSON] wins by so many points he does not need any help. He does not need it. I say, [PERSON], do you need any help? No, I am okay. He will win by [CARDINAL], [DATE]. They are okay. These guys you know a funny thing? The ones that love [PERSON], the ones that are really the [NORP] like [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], so many of them. I do not want to I could just name so many. They are the ones that win with that. I mean, it is like they do not even have an election. It is the ones that sort of they are a little shy about embracing what we are all about, they get clobbered. They get clobbered. Take a look. Those are the ones that get clobbered. But the good news is they are all starting to find that out. [DATE], [ORG] [NORP] opposed legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children who survive abortions. Virtually every [NORP] voted against protecting these precious babies. Every one. They vote in groups. And we did have that great victory. We won for [CARDINAL]. And [CARDINAL] that we did not like got out. They said they retired. They did not retire. They were retired. They said, These [CARDINAL] senators have decided to retire. No, no, no. They retired because they had like very little support. Like how about [PERCENT]? Any percent. No, we did great. We had [CARDINAL] we picked up in the [ORG]. They were going to win the [ORG], remember? And I will tell you, folks, I worked hard. I did [CARDINAL] big, fat rallies. And those rallies brought us to a tremendous [ORG] victory so that we can continue onward with our judges and our approvals. And the fake news back there, they love to say [PERSON] suffered a big defeat. First of all, we won the [ORG], which, frankly, judges you know, I hate to say it: In all due respect for us, the [ORG], far more important. I really worked hard. But think of it. We won the [ORG] and we had this, like, tremendous victory. We get no credit at all. Wait until you see what happens. They say, [PERSON] suffered a humiliating defeat. I said, I was not running. And [CARDINAL] of the commentators and I appreciate it [CARDINAL] of the shows where they were saying how I suffered a defeat, this commentator said, Excuse me, he did not run. You know, not all our candidates were exactly great. Let us face it. You know, you can only do so much. But wait until you see what is happening when I do run. And what they do not say is governor of [GPE], great guy. [PERSON]. [PERSON]. [PERSON] was down [CARDINAL]. He won by [CARDINAL] with [DATE]. Right? He was down by [CARDINAL]. [DATE] into the election, I went out, I campaigned, worked hard, made a speech. [PERSON] was there. Everybody was there. It was a fantastic crowd like this. Like this. And all the people in the other ballrooms that are waiting for us. And he ended up winning. He was down by [CARDINAL]; he won by [CARDINAL]. [DATE]. Then we have [GPE] the governor of [GPE]. Great guy. Where is [GPE]? Great guy. He was losing in the primary by [CARDINAL]. I got a call from [PERSON] and [PERSON] [CARDINAL] great guys. Could you endorse him? I said, Let me check. And I checked him. He was a [NORP] before [PERSON] was a Trumper. And I said, I love this guy. He is down by [CARDINAL]. He won by [CARDINAL]. Can you believe that? I endorsed him, [PERSON]. He won by [CARDINAL]. Then he had a tough race against the new star of [ORG] not [NORP]. It is [NORP]. We have to do that. You know, it sounds prettier when we use [NORP]. I even like I hate to say in the speech, [ORG] because it does not sound good. But that is all the more reason I use it, because it does not . They should change it because it sounds much better. Rhetorically, it is much better. Much better. But then, he had an election against their star who followed me after the State of the Union Address. I did not think she was great. But she is their star. And who showed up? [PERSON], [PERSON], and President [PERSON]. And they campaigned for her, and they worked so hard. And all our man had was [PERSON]. And we kicked their ass. True. We had a rally at the airport, where [CARDINAL] people showed up to the airport. It was [CARDINAL] hangar. They had [CARDINAL] other hangars that were full. They went so far back. The problem was they gave the press, like these guys they gave the press too good a location because the people behind them could not see properly. I was so angry. But we had [CARDINAL] people show up. I said, You are going to win the election. He won the election. He won it fairly easily, against their star. And now [PERSON] is going to win for senator in [DATE]. And then and then we had [GPE], and many others. And we have a candidate, [PERSON] a friend. A friend of many of us in this room. But nobody knew he was running. He was running against, in the primary, somebody that was easily going to win. He was scheduled to be the next governor of [GPE]. But [PERSON] has been great to me on the witch hunt. He is been a defender of me against these phony charges of [GPE]. [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE]. My wife said, You never spoke to anybody from [GPE], darling. I said, That is right. But [PERSON] I like people that defend me. You know, when people defend me, I defend them. So he came. That is why I like [PERSON]. That is why I like [PERSON]. And I am not sure a lot of people like him. He is tough as hell. But I like him. I love him. But then we have [GPE]. So, [PERSON] is at [CARDINAL]. [CARDINAL]. He calls up, Sir, can I have your endorsement? I said, [PERSON], you are at [CARDINAL]. Your opponent is, I guess, agriculture commissioner has [CARDINAL] in the bank. His poll numbers are very good. He is up in the [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL]. I said, [PERSON], do not make me do this, [PERSON]. Sir, I can win. All right, [PERSON]. Here we go. Because I know if he loses which almost never happens when I endorse somebody. Almost never. [CARDINAL] time, and that was because it was done in the middle of [DATE] of the election. Nobody knew I did it. They got home, they said, I did not know [PERSON] endorsed him. But we rarely, rarely lose. But I said, [PERSON], do not do it. I said, All right, I will do it. He went from [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL]. To [CARDINAL]. And then he ran against a guy who had unbelievable support. He had every celebrity go into [GPE]. He had money all over the place. And [PERSON] was in there pitching, and I was in there pitching with him. And we now have a great governor in the state of [GPE]. And I could mention many others other governors, many other states. But I am not going to bore you with it. And I think I really think that it is incredible what we did in the midterms. I think it is incredible. Governor of [GPE]. Governor of [GPE]. Remember, You cannot win unless you win the state of [GPE]. We got the governor of [GPE], and he is great. [PERSON]. We love you, [PERSON]. As we defend [NORP] values at home, we are also defending. [NORP] security abroad. We have secured all sorts of funding, all sorts of record everything. And we will never forget our military. We will never forget our veterans. We are taking care of our veterans like they have never been taken care of before. We just got them Choice, so now they can go see a doctor. Now they can go and see a doctor instead of waiting on line for [DATE] and [DATE] and [DATE]. And we got them Accountability. You could not fire anybody in the [ORG]. You had sadists. You had people that took advantage of our veterans. They have hit them. They were sadists. They were sick people. You could not fire them. You had thieves that were stealing openly stealing. You could not fire them. I got a bill passed: [ORG] Accountability. Now you look at the guy, you say, Get the hell out of here. You are fired. Get out. Nobody thought we could get it. For [DATE] they tried to get it. For [DATE] they tried to get it; they could not get it. And [ORG], they thought for [DATE] they'd been trying to get [ORG]. You could not get it. Now, instead of waiting on line for [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] people were dying. People that were not very sick would be dead by the time they saw a doctor, [DATE]. Now these great veterans, if there is a big wait, they go outside, they go to a local doctor. We pay the bills. They get better. Everybody is happy. And we actually save a lot of money, if you can believe it. And I got that approved after [DATE] of being unable to get it approved for our veterans. We love our veterans. And just in finishing up, as you know, I just returned from [GPE], where I had very productive meetings with Chairman [PERSON]. Very productive. We get along. We have developed a good relationship very good and made great historic progress. And I do get a kick out of all these people in previous administrations: [PERSON] should not, under any circumstances, be doing this or that. You know, they are telling me how to negotiate. These guys died. [CARDINAL] administration gave [MONEY] to him and got nothing. And we have not given him anything yet. I look forward to maybe doing something at some point. But I know [CARDINAL] thing: I am going to get other countries to give. Maybe not us, but I am going to get other countries to give, and if it all works out. If it all works out. But I had to walk. Because every once in a while, you have to walk, because the deal was not a deal that was acceptable to me. I do not like these deals that politicians make. They make a deal just for the sake of doing it. I do not want to do that. I want to make a deal that either works, or let us not make it. But the [CARDINAL] thing we have, though, is we have no testing, no missiles going up, no rockets going up. No nuclear testing. We got our great people back. We get our great, great people. And that includes our beautiful, beautiful [PERSON] whose parents I have gotten to know, who is incredible. And I am in such a horrible position, because in [CARDINAL] way I have to negotiate. In the other way, I love Mr. and Mrs. [PERSON], and I love [PERSON]. And it is a very, very delicate balance. He was a special young man. And to see what happened was so bad. It was so bad. And a lot of what I do with respect to [GPE], and any success that we hopefully have and we have had a lot. We are given no credit. They do not remember that, in [DATE] of the [PERSON] administration, rockets were flying all over the place, nuclear testing was going on. Mountains were being these are big mountains. They were being shoved over [QUANTITY]. People thought it was massive earthquakes, then they found out, no, that was nuclear weapons nuclear testing. So much. We are getting the remains back of a lot of our soldiers from [DATE] ago. [PERSON] was in [GPE]. It was one of the most beautiful ceremonies. We have made a lot of progress, and we will continue to make progress. And I really think what we are doing there is very important. But we actually had to walk, but I think we had a very good meeting. In fact, when I came home, they put out a statement that, actually, they were willing to do much less on the sanction front. But you see, that is not what happened there. So already, I think we are negotiating. And I will tell you this: [GPE] has an incredible, brilliant economic future, if they make a deal. But they do not have any economic future if they have nuclear weapons. It is really a bad thing for them. So we will see how it all goes. But I think it is going well. I think we learned a lot over [DATE]. And again, the relationship seems to be very, very strong. And that is an important thing, especially when we are dealing with this kind of a situation. For [DATE], you watched as your leaders apologized for [GPE]. You saw that. Would you like to apologize? No. I am not apologizing. Now you have a President who is standing up for [GPE]. After [DATE] of building up foreign nations, we are finally building up our nation, and we are doing it with [NORP] hands, [NORP] grit, and with beautiful, beautiful [NORP] steel. We are fighting to ensure that every young [NORP] inherits the same blessings and the same boundless opportunity that our ancestors fought to secure with all of their heart, might, and soul. Now more than ever, we need the proud men and women of [ORG]. And I want to thank everybody here, because it is incredible. Your organization is incredible. [PERSON] and [PERSON], incredible. You are energized, you are mobilized, and you are engaged. We need your voice. We need your patriotism. We need your commitment. We need your incredible spirit on [DATE]. We are having, in [GPE], [GPE], a great tribute to [GPE]. I hope you can all come. [DATE] keep it open. We want to bring [CARDINAL] of people into the city, and we want people to come who love our country. Those are the people we want. [DATE]. A salute to [GPE]. Now is the time to embrace the promise of our history. Now is the time to defend our [NORP] legacy. And now is the time to seize our glorious destiny. And, by the way, I am watching those doors. Not [CARDINAL] person has left, and I have been up here a long time. I said, [PERSON], is that okay? He said, I love it. Do not leave. But not [CARDINAL] person. So if you hear [DATE], when they read people left nobody left early. There has not been [CARDINAL] person that is left. But when you read it, you just say fake news. This magnificent nation will always be the home of those who cherish life, who love liberty, and who defend the sacred rights given to us by Almighty God. Together, we are one people, one family, and [CARDINAL] nation, forever united behind one great [NORP] flag. Thank you to everybody in this room and to all of the other rooms, all over the campus and all over the country. We are hooked in all over the country. Thank you very much. I want to thank [ORG]. What a job they have done. What a job [PERSON] and his family have done in such a short period of time, in bringing this to a level like it is never been before. God bless you. God bless [GPE]. Thank you very much.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsmarjorietaylorgreenedeliversspeechongopprimarywin52422transcript", "text": "Most of all, we must champion the [NORP] worker and the [NORP] small business. We will, if we fight fearlessly and faithfully in [ORG] for what President [PERSON] started, the America First Agenda. Now, everywhere I go in Northwest [GPE], I am humbled and honored by the overwhelming support I receive from many of you here in this room. You would not know that, though, if you only read [ORG] and [ORG], which unfortunately is what a lot of people in [GPE] read. So they might be a little surprised at our numbers [TIME], but we are not. Now I want to tell you this, I am blessed and I am constantly overwhelmed by the [CARDINAL] of letters, cards, voicemails, and emails we receive, not only from right here at home, but from every state in [GPE]. But most of all, beloved [GPE]. It is just my home state, and I love [GPE] so much. My enemies on both the left and the right will never admit it out loud, but I have become one of the most effective members in [ORG] for [ORG], simply by [CARDINAL] thing, you guys, demanding that our party fight for our values of our voters, not the interest of corporate donors or [GPE] insiders. Now, my critics like to produce headlines full of fake outrage, because I keep daring to say things the globalist elites do not want you to hear. They write lies about me and team up with [NORP] to have me sidelined and censored because they know I am the voice of the people, and that scares them the most. I am honored to represent the values of Northwest Georgia. I honor you by leading with my [NORP] faith, and by focusing on traditional family values, I believe in putting [NORP] workers and [NORP] small businesses first. I received a record number of votes from [NORP] on [DATE] in [DATE]. And I took that sign from you all seriously. I got to work, and even before being sworn in, by leading the congressional objection to [PERSON] fraudulent electoral votes on the [ORG] floor, that was important. Now, since then, I have kept my campaign promises to all of you. I fight [DATE] in every way I can to stop the [NORP] communist agenda. [CARDINAL] way I have done that is by calling for roll call votes, putting [ORG] on record. By demanding transparency and forcing [ORG] to vote on record, I have defeated radical bills like squad member, [PERSON]'s bill to allow felons to vote in jail; that should never happen. But we stopped it. That is more than any top ranking [NORP] accomplished on any [ORG] committee. Not only that, I have filed [ORG] legislation, I have offered legislation to preserve and protect our second amendment, I have offered bills to impeach [PERSON] [CARDINAL] times, bills to fire Dr. [PERSON], bills to expel insurrectionist [PERSON], bills to eliminate the [ORG], bills to ban vaccine mandates, and bills to secure our Southern border and finish President [PERSON]'s wall. I even released my own congressional oversight report on my visit to the [GPE] jail, which currently houses [DATE] pretrial defendants, still to [DATE]. My report revealed the horrific conditions they face. I called for an end to the abuse of pretrial defendants and for the termination of the person overseeing their care, Deputy Warden [PERSON]. I have hit a few roadblocks on the way, perhaps because the [GPE] elites realize that I would always put you the voters first. Just after I was sworn in [NORP] recognized me as the biggest threat to their communist agenda in [ORG] and made me their number [CARDINAL] target. We can remember all those news stories. Well, they kicked me off committees, not just [NORP], but unfortunately [CARDINAL] [NORP], because they knew I was not going to go along with their [GPE] last establishment agenda. They kicked me off because they realize, you know what, I am just like you; I am a proud [NORP] and I am tired of the business as usual in the swamp. Now to tell you the truth, in the current [DATE] [ORG] committees are useless for [NORP]. [NORP] are in the minority and [PERSON] rules [ORG] with an iron fist. [ORG] bills and amendments are rejected and hardly see the light of day. But that will not last forever. When [NORP] take back the majority in [DATE], it is going to be a different story. I will be back on committees, you can count on that. Our party will have the power to make those committees useful and hold [NORP] in the deep state who have put our country through hell accountable. I ran for [ORG] in [DATE] because I was sick and tired of [NORP] doing absolutely nothing even when they are put in charge, holding hands with [NORP], got us here. What are we? [CARDINAL] in debt now; it is a shame. I am running for reelection because my work to put people over politicians is just beginning. Failed leaders like [PERSON] and neocons like [PERSON], who by the way, I think is in [GPE] and probably visiting [GPE] with [PERSON], are eager to work with [NORP] to pass [PERSON] [GPE] last agenda. They reject the priorities of grassroots conservatives, but so long as I am in [ORG], you will always have a voice. You will always have a champion working for each and every single one of you. I have been in [GPE] on your behalf for [DATE], seems like maybe [DATE]. So I have had the chance to learn a few things. And [TIME] I'd like to let you in on a little secret, the people you see on TV, in press conferences, or walking the halls of [ORG], you know, the diabolical evil masterminds who always seen [CARDINAL] steps ahead, the ones who have caused us all so much misery, they are actually idiots. Surprise, but you already knew that. The only reason they get away with the things they get away with is because [NORP] have not stood up to them. When the elites wield the power of the state against patriots, they can be terrifying. I am shocked at the cruel and illegal treatment of many nonviolent [DATE] protestors, while [PERCENT] of [ORG] and [ORG] domestic terrorists had their charges dropped. That is a [CARDINAL]-tier justice system, and that should not exist in our country. But our enemies in [GPE] are not as smart as they think they are, and they are not unbeatable. They are good at [CARDINAL] thing, though, they watch who and what gets popular, and they decide whether to take it out and strangle it, or take it over and claim the credit. Whether it is [NORP] following [ORG] off a cliff into communism, or [NORP] rushing to embrace the populous wing of our own party, the elites scramble to copy what we say, and then pretend it was their idea all along. They do these things because they simply do not care about you. In fact, they look down on us and they hate us. They know that if enough of us said, Stop, their influence would disappear. And that is what they fear the most. Their fear makes us powerful. Sending me back to [GPE] will send a message to the blood sucking establishment, it is we who will set the political agenda for [DATE] and not them. You see, it is the elites that do not have any true affinity for the country they govern. They prefer [PERSON] to [PERSON], [GPE]. And that is a real shame. So we are going to start speaking the truth more loudly and fearlessly than ever before; we are going to work together, and we are going to take our country back. Now, the globalist are going to see that we are the majority in this country, and we have both the right and the power to determine our own destiny. That is what being an [NORP]'s all about, right? We are the majority who want an end to trans-terrorism, socialist monetary policy, endless wars and nation building across the world, and the slow drain of our sovereignty into unaccountable foreign institutions run by sinister unelected fanatics. We are the majority who want our border secure, [NORP] energy independence, and groceries we can afford. We are the majority who after Roe v. Wade is overturned, will protect the lives of the innocent children in the womb from the moment of conception. We are the majority who, when we put our minds to it, can wreck the [NORP] plans for their terrifying [ORG], and send [PERSON] scuttling back to the karaoke bar where she belongs. We are the majority who even now still wants to see [PERSON] in jail. When conservatives work together to fight for [NORP] ideals, we can win. We have proven it. We can join hands to defy [NORP] horrors, whether it is evil social engineering in our daughter's locker rooms, communism in the halls of [ORG], or the [ORG] harassing and intimidating parents at our school boards, [ORG] has no choice but to fall in line, and they will, and they want to. I can already see changes happening in [GPE]; think tanks and political consultants and academics are starting to admit that the neocon project was a mistake, and that globalism has gone too far, and gone on too long. They are rebranding themselves populist and nationalist, and [ORG]. I do not have faith in the character or integrity of a lot of these slimy people, but I do believe in their sense of self preservation; believe me, they know how to survive. So when we take back the [ORG], I believe [ORG] will come to its senses and once again begin to reflect the priorities of ordinary working [NORP] families who have for so long been ridiculed, ignored and taken for granted, we will never forget being called a basket full of deplorables, right? Because I believe that we are on the verge of a great [NORP] revival, a revival so enormous and so profound that no one will be able to stand in its way. I believe that this revival of faith, family, and freedom, a revival of [NORP] morals and constitutional values is ours to welcome in if we want it. I am convinced that the establishment in [GPE] knows this too. They know that [GPE]'s patience for tyranny, communism, child abuse, the murder of the unborn, corporations and teachers grooming our kids, and politically weaponized law enforcement agencies is that an end. The era of mandates, and lockdowns, and jabs, and censorship, and lies is ending because the [NORP] people will no longer tolerate their government declaring war on its own citizens and our own values. Every politician says that an upcoming election is the most important one ever, most of the time that is not true, they are just trying to get people out to vote. But there is a storm brewing in our nation [DATE]. Hail and thunder are coming for the elites who despise us and who want us to eat the bugs, drink the poop water, and live in the pods, and own nothing, yet somehow be happy. I am sorry, do any of you want that future? No. So [PERSON] [inaudible [TIME]]. Y'all do not want his fake Petri dish meat? Beyond meat or something. In [DATE], this nation came together to show the [GPE] elites and university professors and line news reporters that we hold the power of self-governance. We reminded them that they are not in charge, we are. We elected [PERSON], and we will make an [NORP] revival possible just when it is seemed as though our nation might be lost to faceless bureaucrats, [NORP] commissions, [ORG], and [ORG]. [TIME] I am calling on you to help me continue the [ORG] movement, and commit to rebuilding a happier, healthier, more law-abiding, more caring, and more morally accountable [GPE] in which we respect God and his plans for us, and in which we protect the future of our children and our grandchildren. And so my friends, although [TIME] is a celebration, it is also an invitation. We are at the start of something here in [DATE]. Some people are describing it as a return of some [DATE] energy here in [GPE]'s 14th district. You have power to affect change nationally in a way, many other [NORP] do not , you are sending me back to [GPE] to put our country and our people first to make [GPE] great. Again, you and me working together can succeed in a place that fails you [DATE]. And we know that this is possible because we are already on that journey. I will continue to speak the truth and fight back against the uni-party in [GPE], [GPE]. Together, we will hold their feet to the fire, together we can inspire the rest of [GPE] to be just like Northwest [GPE], and elect people who will fight for you in [GPE], [GPE]. Now, in the 118th [ORG] with [NORP] in power, we will launch real investigations with teeth to hold accountable and to jail bad actors in the deep state who work [DATE] to strip away your freedoms. We will finish President [PERSON]'s border wall and secure our [NORP] border. And we will reign in big tech companies and stop those woke corporations from shutting down and silencing conservatives and destroying our freedom of speech. We will stop the evil influence of [ORG] in our economy and our institutions. We will achieve [NORP] energy independence again. And we will investigate and fire Dr. [PERSON]; nobody voted for him in the first place. We will kick [PERSON] and [PERSON] off committees so they can no longer pervert our constitution. And yes, if we work hard and if we want it badly enough, we will impeach [PERSON]. As many of you know, I have a great relationship with President [PERSON]. He is my favorite president after all. I am going to work with him to deliver the [GPE] First policies that [GPE] needs and [GPE] desperately wants. We miss him, do not we? I think the whole world misses President [PERSON] right now. I pray that you will show the same faith in me [DATE] that you have [TIME], [GPE], and I thank you for that, the same faith that you did [DATE]. Meanwhile, I look forward to a [NORP] majority in [DATE]. I also look confidently ahead at the presidential election in [DATE]. We can, and we will win that race too. And we have to, if we truly want to save [GPE] and stop communism, we are going to lead the way. Now, last of all, thank you, thank you, thank you. May God bless every single one of you, every single one of you; and may God bless the great State of [GPE], and let us save [GPE] and stop communism. Thank you so much everyone.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsberniesanderscoronavirusspeechtranscriptonprimarynightmarch17", "text": "I do not have to tell anyone viewing this program that our country, and in fact the world of facing an unprecedented series of crises. We are dealing with the coronavirus, which is spreading throughout this country and throughout the world. We are dealing with a growing economic meltdown, which will impact [CARDINAL] of workers in this country. We are dealing with a political crisis as well. And I think the main point to be made [TIME] is that in this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together, understand that right now throughout this country, there are so many of our people wondering, what is going to happen to me [DATE] in my own city? [GPE], [GPE], laws have been shut down. restaurants shutdown, showcase centers shut down, schools shutdown. What happens to all the people who lose their jobs? What happens to the people who [TIME] are worried that they may have the coronavirus but do not have the resources to get the tests they need or the treatment that they need. So this is a moment that we have got to be working together and going forward together. And what I wanted to do [TIME] along with you is to talk about a series of proposals that we all working on right now and will introduce to the democratic leadership as to how we can best go forward. And in this unprecedented moment this will require an unprecedented amount of money and my own guess is that we will be spending [MONEY] in funding to prevent deaths, job losses, and to avoid an economic catastrophe. So let me just go over some of the issues and we will be posting these ideas [DATE] up on our website, [ORG]. And this is what I would like because we certainly do not know it all we want to hear from you, not only your ideas about how we can best go forward, talk about your experiences. In every state there is a different level of crisis, in every occupation there is a different level of concern. So please communicate with us so we can get the best understanding possible about what is going on in our country and how together we can come up with some effective remedies. Let me start off with the basics and that is obviously from my perspective and I know from all of your perspectives. We need to make certain that everybody in our country who needs to go to a doctor can get the healthcare they need regardless of their income. This is kind of a no-brainer. It is something that should have happened in our country [DATE]. But in the midst of this crisis, what I believe we must do is empower [ORG] to cover all medical bills during this emergency. Now, this is not [ORG] for all. We cannot pass that right now, but what this does say is that if you are uninsured, if you are under insured, if you have high deductibles, if you have high copayments, if you have out of pocket expenses, [ORG] will cover those expenses so that everybody, regardless of their healthcare needs, and I am not just talking about the coronavirus, but their health care needs in the midst of this crisis, will get all the healthcare that they need. That is what we should be doing in this moment of crisis. We need to make sure furthermore, that as we go forward, we are effectively prepared to deal with the healthcare crisis that we are facing and that means that we need to make sure that the hospitals have all of the ICU units and the ventilators that are needed to respond to this crisis. What the fear is as you know, is that there will be a surge of patients coming into the hospitals and that we will not have the equipment that we need to deal with that crisis. Now, in my view, I mean, frankly, it is incomprehensible why in the wealthiest country on earth, we are not better prepared, but be that as it may, in my view right now, the federal government must work aggressively with the private sector to make certain that this equipment is available to hospitals and the rest of the medical community. In other words, federal government must take the responsibility of working with the private sector and saying, you know what, this is a major priority. You are going to get the job done. And during this crisis, in addition, of course, we need to mobilize medical residents, people in medical school, retired medical professionals and other medical personnel to help us deal with this crisis. One of the great fears that we are facing right now is that doctors themselves and nurses themselves will become ill. And if our frontline defense in the medical profession is injured, is made sick, is not able to treat the [NORP] people, that is only going to make a very difficult situation even worse. Furthermore, and again, this goes without saying, it is something that should have been done, It has to be done immediately. We must massively increase the availability of test kits, test kits for coronavirus and the speed at which the tests are processed. We must look to successful coronavirus testing models in other countries and throughout our own country and implement best practices here. And right now there are communities and states all over this country that do not have the test kits. It is taking too long to get the results. We have got to aggressively address that. In my view, we need to use existing emergency authority under the Defense Production Act to dramatically scale up production in [GPE] of critical supplies such as masks, ventilators, and protective equipment that our healthcare workers need. It is again, quite unbelievable, but we have a short supply of masks, and if the doctors and nurses do not have the masks that they need, it is going to be very difficult for them to provide the care that patients require. We need to utilize the national guard, [ORG] and other military resources to deal with this crisis. [DATE] our armed forces must be immediately activated to build mobile hospitals and testing facilities, assist providers reopen hospitals that have been shut down and expand our healthcare capacity in underserved areas. [CARDINAL] of the ongoing crisis is that our healthcare system faces in many parts of this country under the best of times, people cannot find a doctor or a hospital [QUANTITY] away from them. That is not acceptable and we have to address that reality in the midst of this crisis [DATE]. We need to dramatically expand community health centers, which provide primary care, dental care and mental health care, as well as low cost prescription drugs to [CARDINAL] [NORP], including some of the poorest and most vulnerable. We have a primary healthcare system which is in very, very bad shape. Even people who have insurance having a hard time in many cases finding the doctors that they need. So expanding community health centers will be a significant step forward in making sure that there are locations where people can get the testing they need, get the treatment that they need, get the healthcare that they need in general. And while we are making sure that all of our people have the healthcare that they need, we must also respond to the growing economic crisis that this pandemic is causing. That means that we must make sure that everyone who has a job right now receives the paychecks that they need and does not lose their income. As we speak right now, think about the [CARDINAL] of workers who are being laid off in the tourism industry, in the fast food industry, in the restaurant industry, in the transportation industry. These are folks who do not have a lot of money as all of you know, [PERCENT] of the people in this country cannot afford a $[MONEY] emergency. So people are sitting out there and they are saying, My God, what am I going to do? How do I take care of my families? And that has got, got to be the major, major economic priority that we address. How do we take care of the working families of this country who are negatively impacted by this crisis? Small and medium size businesses, especially those in severely impacted industries such as restaurants, bars, and local retail need immediate relief. We must tell these businesses who are being forced to lay off, in some cases their entire staff or possibly even shut down through no fault of their own, that we will not allow them to go out of business. The federal government will work with affected businesses to provide direct payroll costs for small and medium-sized businesses to keep workers employed until this crisis has passed. In other words, bottom line here, most important point is workers need to continue to get a paycheck even when their businesses are shut down. Further, we need to provide a direct emergency [MONEY] [MONEY] cash payment to every household in [GPE] every month for the duration of the crisis to provide them with the assistance they need to pay their bills and take care of their families. Now we are throwing out a lot of ideas and when you deal with the [GPE] [ORG], you do not get everything that you want. There will be picking and choosing here and there, but I think it is important for us [TIME] to discuss the various options that they have. And one of those options is to make sure that people at least getting $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] a month check to take care of their basic needs. And importantly, we must make certain that the government is getting this money into the hands of working families and the most vulnerable as quickly as possible. In other words, we do not want some kind of bureaucratic arrangement. We were talking about this for [DATE] and [DATE] and people do not get the help that they need. We must provide emergency unemployment assistance to anyone who loses their job through no fault of their own. Under the proposal that I am working on, everyone who loses a job must qualify for unemployment compensation at [PERCENT] of their prior salary with a cap of $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] a year. In addition, those who depend on tips, waiters and waitresses and others, gig workers, domestic workers, freelancers, and independent contractors must also qualify for unemployment insurance to make up for the income that they lose during this crisis. I think as many of you know, unemployment compensation does not cover every worker in [GPE]. There are [CARDINAL] of people exempt from unemployment. We have got to deal with that right now. It does not matter what work you are doing. If you lose your job, you need unemployment. Further, we need to make certain that seem as people with disabilities and families with children have access to decent quality food. That means expanding the [ORG] program, the school meals program and food stamps so that no one goes hungry during this crisis and everyone who cannot leave that home can receive nutritious meals delivered directly to where they live. In other words, that is as basic as you can get in [GPE] during this crisis, people must not go hungry. We must place an immediate moratorium on evictions, on foreclosures and utility shutoffs and suspend payment on mortgage loans for primary residences and utility bills. In other words, it would be unacceptable that people could lose their homes, lose their apartments, see electricity or gas shutoffs during this crisis, so they must be a moratorium in those areas. Furthermore, we must restore utility services to any customers who have had the utilities shut off. Unbelievably in [GPE] right now, you have got a whole lot of folks who literally do not have running water in their homes because they have not been able to pay their water bill, they may not have electricity and that has got to be dealt with right now. We must also provide funding for states and localities to provide rental assistance for the duration of this crisis. In addition, we need to waive all student loan payments for the duration of the emergency. Longterm as I think all of you know, it is my view that we must cancel all student debt and make public colleges and universities and trade schools tuition free, and that is the view that I have held for a long time. But right now at the very least, we must make sure that nobody is obliged to pay their student loan right now. Furthermore, we must ensure that the homeless survivors of domestic violence and college students quarantined off campus are able to receive the shelter, the healthcare, and the nutrition they need and connect those individuals with social services to ensure nobody is left behind. We must also utilize empty hotel beds and other vacant properties to ensure that everyone in this country is safely housed during this crisis. We cannot forget that right now, [TIME], there are [CARDINAL], 000 people who are homeless, some in emergency shelters, some who are sleeping out on the street. Our job is to make sure that everyone is safely housed during this crisis. Further, we must protect farmers by suspending all farm service agency loan payments to protect farmers during this crisis, extend crop insurance and emergency loans to all affected farmers, extend rural development loans, and expand the emergency food assistance program to help alleviate hunger throughout the country and support our farmers during this crisis. We already have a major, major crisis in terms of family-based agriculture in [GPE]. [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] of family farmers are losing their farms, we have got to stop that process right now during this emergency. Finally, we must make sure that our response to this health and economic crisis is not another moneymaking opportunity for corporate [GPE] and for Wall Street. Let me underline that. We must make certain that this health and economic crisis is not another moneymaking opportunity for corporate [GPE] and for Wall Street. We need to establish an oversight agency to ensure that no one is profiting off of the economic pain and suffering of our people in the midst of this crisis. Any emergency credit extensions or loans to insolvent companies or industries as a result of this crisis must come with strict protections and benefits for workers, for unions and for customers not no strings attached handouts for large corporations and their executives. During this crisis, we will ban stock buy backs and bonuses for executives. We will put conditions on this financial assistance to make certain that any corporation in [GPE] that benefits from emergency aid does not lay off workers, pays workers a livable wage and does not rip off consumers. We must make sure that companies they get bailouts are required to sell equity to the government and put workers on their board of directors. We need to prevent price gouging by pharmaceutical companies. As soon as coronavirus vaccine is developed, it must be sold for free. This is not an opportunity for some drug companies to make a fortune by charging an outrageous price for the medicine that people need in order to stay alive. Further all prescription drugs that are developed with taxpayer dollars must be sold at a reasonable price. The pharmaceutical industry must be told in no uncertain terms that the medicines that they manufacture for this crisis will be sold at cost. This is not the time for profiteering or price gouging. So we have covered a lot of territory [TIME] and this is what I would very much appreciate where I'd appreciate getting your help. Once again, this is an outline of proposals that I will be introducing to the [ORG] leadership and working with the [NORP] leadership to implement. But it is important for me to hear your comments. We will have this outline up [DATE] in a little bit clearer way on our website, [ORG]. And in addition to that we need to know what you are experiencing right now. It is hard to write proper legislation if we are not familiar with the kinds of pain and problems that people all across this country are facing. So let me just conclude by once again thanking all of you for being with us [TIME] to understand that what this country is experiencing right now is something that we have never experienced in the modern history of this country. That is, number [CARDINAL], a major pandemic, which threatens the health and lives of [CARDINAL] of our people. And on top of that, an economic crisis which threatens the jobs and the income of many, many, many [CARDINAL] of people. So we got some major crises, but I have the strong belief that if we work together, if we do not turn to fear and panic, but if we understand that the way we solve this is by going forward as [CARDINAL] people, remembering those who are hurting [TIME] and will be hurting in the future. This is the richest country in the history of the world. This is a country with unbelievable energy, with unbelievable talent, with incredible resources, we can do it. We can address this crisis. We can minimize the pain and let us do just that. So let us go forward together and I look forward to continuing to communicate with you, to tell you where we are coming from, what our ideas are, and look forward to hearing from you as to what your ideas are and what your situation is. So once again, thank you very much for joining us [TIME]. Good [TIME].", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsdonaldtrumpnewmexicorallytranscriptfullspeechtranscript", "text": "Wow, thank you. Thank you, [GPE]. Thank you. We love being with you. We love being with you. Incredible people, incredible people. Thank you very much. And I am thrilled to be here in [GPE] with [CARDINAL] of hard-working, freedom-loving [NORP] patriots. Thank you. Incredible. We are all united by the same love of our great country. And by the way, our country is doing great. You see it. The same devotion to family and the same profound faith that [GPE] is blessed by, the eternal grace of Almighty God. Good [TIME] to that person. [DATE] they will say, Massive protest. No, [CARDINAL] person just going home to mommy a little bit sooner. [TIME]. But we are bound by these convictions. We will campaign for every vote, and we will win the great state of [GPE] in [DATE]. And by the way, you have [CARDINAL] of people outside who cannot get in. So we love you, we love you, we appreciate it. We try to get the biggest arena we can get, and they are never big enough, frankly. So there is something going on. And I always say, [DATE], I do not know if there'll ever be another [DATE]. But right now it is like a great tree or a great plant, you plant it and it has to take hold. We have to win [DATE]. We are doing so well. We have to win [DATE]. And [DATE], and you know as well as I do, we are battling against the corrupt establishment of the past, and we are achieving historic victories for the [NORP] people. We are winning again. We are winning again, and we are winning big. We are winning big. Crucially for your state, we have ended the last administration's war on [NORP] energy. And since my election, natural gas productions, big story [DATE], in [GPE] has increased by [PERCENT], [CARDINAL]-0. And that means great wages, and it means jobs. And that is why you are breaking every single record in your state's book. Crude oil production in [GPE] has more than doubled, and going up a lot higher very quickly. And your state's energy revenues are up by [CARDINAL]. Think of that. [CARDINAL]. And that is in a short period of time. Give me a little bit more time, okay? [GPE] is now the number [CARDINAL] producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. And this means more jobs, higher wages, and [NORP] energy independence, which is what we have. [DATE], if we had a problem like you saw [DATE] in the Middle East, we would've been in a panic. Although, not if I were your president. We never panic. We do not want to panic. But [DATE], they would have been in a panic. [DATE] we got a lot of oil, we got a lot of gas. We got a lot of oil and gas. We do not have to send too many boats over there. Did you notice [DATE], they were saying, We do not see too many [NORP] ships anymore. You know why? Because we do not need We are independent, as independent as we want. And we are now a net exporter of energy. Revenues from energy production provide [PERCENT] of your state's budget and going much higher in the very near future. And they have generated nearly a [MONEY] budget surplus in [GPE]. Thank you very much, [SPEAKER]. Thank you. Now, under the Green New Deal, that all goes away. That all goes away. It all goes away. You can forget it. No more cows, no more airplanes, no more trips. A single car. Make it electric. Single car. You are not allowed to travel [QUANTITY]. They will call us the hermit nation. We will never leave our house. No, it is crazy. But that is okay. I do not want to bring it up because I do not want to do it too early. Maybe they will change, and I do not want them to change. But think of it for you, and for [GPE], and for so many other places, they want to get rid of your energy. I mean, explain that one. Explain that. Yet, every major [NORP] running for president, they want to abolish all production of oil and natural gas. In other words, the [NORP] want to completely annihilate [GPE] economy. The [NORP] want us to be subservient to foreign producers. They want us to be at the mercy of rogue regimes. That is not happening anymore. It is been a long time. It is been a long time. It is not happening anymore. But [NORP] will never get the chance because [GPE] will never give them that chance. Under this administration, [GPE] is working again. [GPE] is winning again. And [GPE] is respected again, like it has not been for a long time. And I can tell you because I meet so many of the leaders, and their presidents, and their kings, and their queens, and their prime ministers, and their everything, dictators every once in a while. Every once in a while, you get an a rogue dictator. And I will tell you, they always start off, [DATE] I had the Crown Prince of [GPE], and they come in and they say, Sir, I'd like to congratulate you on what you have done with the economy of [GPE]. It is a model for the entire world. They all say it. And [TIME] Do we have any baseball fans? Right? Right? You know what I am going to say. But [TIME] in [FAC], I had the honor of awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom, that is the highest civilian award, to someone who truly embodies the [NORP] dream, baseball legend, the greatest, by the way, the greatest relief pitcher of all time, you look at those records, [PERSON]. He was something. The [ORG] won a lot of World Series because of [PERSON]. Great guy. We gave him the medal. Done so much for charity. A fantastic man, fantastic family. It was [DATE] at [FAC], so it was good. My administration is fighting to empower all [NORP] to reach their dreams and achieve their potential. We have created [CARDINAL] new jobs since [DATE]. The fake news would never have allowed us to say that during the campaign, even as a projection. Unemployment recently reached its lowest rate in [DATE]. [CARDINAL] [NORP] have been lifted off of food stamps. [CARDINAL], 000 [NORP] came into the labor force [DATE] alone. Think of that. Wages in your state, [GPE], are growing at a rate of much more than 3% a year, which is unheard of [DATE]. And I used to say during the campaign, you go back, it is hard to believe, I am here [DATE] Can you believe how time is flying? Can you believe it? I do not know about it me, but you look all much better than you did [DATE]. You are wealthier. And even with the Me Too movement, we cannot say this, but I will say it anyway, you are better looking, including the men, including the men. Now you are all looking good. Since my election, the number of new business applications for [GPE] has increased by [PERCENT], more than any state in [GPE]. Think of that. More than any state in [GPE]. So essentially, that is saying you are in a certain category, which is a very important category, you are doing better than any state in [GPE]. How do I lose [GPE]? Explain that one, right? How do we lose that one? And yet, for whatever reason, it is been quite a while since a [NORP] won this state. But we are going to win this state. And I think we are going to win this state easy. You had to see the people all the way in from the airport. That was a long drive by the way, [TIME]. That was a long drive. But all the way in, we had people, and they were waving. And I did not see any negative hand gesture, right? No, I think we are going to do great here. And we are here for a number of reasons, but we are here because we really think we are going to turn this state and make it a [NORP] state. [DATE] marked the beginning of [DATE]. Who is [NORP] here? [NORP] for [SPEAKER]. Thank you. Incredible people. But we have much to celebrate. Unbelievable when you think, the unemployment for [NORP] is right now at the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country. [NORP] poverty reached a brand new all-time low in history. And after [DATE] of stagnation that you know very well, wages for [NORP] are rising really fast, up [PERCENT] since my election. Those are unheard of numbers. They are unheard of. And median income, think of that, median income for [NORP] surpassed [MONEY] for the first time ever. That is your median. That is not bad. That means you are wealthy and you are getting wealthier fast. And I just want to tell you it is an honor. But when I am on the debate stage debating [CARDINAL] of these far left radical [NORP], whoever it may be, and they start telling you what they are going to do for you, and you say, But we have the best numbers, every category, that we have ever had. [NORP] excuse me, [GPE] as a whole, we have the best numbers. [NORP], the best numbers that we have ever had in the history of our country. [NORP], the best numbers that we have ever had in history. Women, the best numbers that we have had in [DATE]. We are working night and day to deliver a future of limitless opportunity for our nation's [NORP] citizens, including [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] of extraordinary [NORP] who enrich our society, strengthen our country, serve in our military, and contribute immensely to our shared [NORP] family. And I want to just tell you that [GPE] is doing a great job for us on the border, and I want to thank the president of [GPE]. You know, it is very interesting, I hear everybody screaming, well, you know we are building the wall, and it is going up, and it is going up fast. And if you think that is easy with the [NORP] who control the [ORG], we have to take it back, but if you think it is easy But we are building a lot of wall. We will have [QUANTITY] of wall built by [DATE], and it is making a big difference. [QUANTITY]. But you know we won a big case [DATE] in [ORG] that allowed us to do what we are doing. This has been I will tell you what. Ready? Another president would have given up a long time ago. We do not give up. So we are building the wall, [ORG], we are doing a beautiful job. It is a great, it is a great structure. It is a great structure. You are going to have to really want to get over that wall, to do it. But it was very interesting because, not too long ago, I saw where the [NORP]-American, the [NORP], were up with me in a poll, [PERCENT]. And everyone said, How is that? How is that? How is that? [PERCENT]. Up by [PERCENT]. I will not even tell you what the final number was because they will not believe it, but you are going to see what the final number But you know why? Because [NORP], they understand, they do not want criminals coming across the border. They do not want people taking their jobs. They want to have that security, and they want the wall. They want the wall. And we have a man in the audience who is, I think, the best dressed man in this entire place, including me, right here. Look at him. Come here. Look at him. Look at this guy. And he is been to a couple of rallies too, have not you? Huh? We have some people, a group of people the other day, you know, we had a victory in [GPE] that was unbelievable. [CARDINAL] of them. [CARDINAL] of them, it was going to be very, very close. Here is another one of my friends. Thank you. I like that beautiful red tie you are wearing. But we had a victory, [CARDINAL] victories, [GPE], where [CARDINAL] was [CARDINAL] points down [DATE], we got involved, we started sending out lots of different social media messages, we did a couple of little robo calls, but the big thing, we did a speech [TIME]. The turnout was beyond belief. And instead of being down by [CARDINAL] points, he easily won the election [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] 000 votes. And [PERSON] was up a couple of points, and he ended up winning, I do not know, I'd ask the media, but they will not give me how many What did he get? Do you know? Like [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL]? He won by a lot. He won by a lot. I'd asked them, but we are not going to get a straight answer. They were not happy. They were not happy. I will tell you, [DATE] [TIME], the fake news was not happy. They had their studios all built. [ORG] had their A- list talent. They do not have A-list talent, but they had the best they could have. And they were all set. This was going to be the end of [SPEAKER], because this man was going to lose. But he turned out to be tough and smart. And in all fairness, I helped a lot too. And toward the end of [TIME], they started dismantling that studio. Probably it would have been there for [DATE]. This is the end. But we had [CARDINAL] great victories, congressional victories, on [DATE] [TIME]. And it was something. The [CARDINAL] gentleman won by a number that nobody thought even possible, so much. And the other won a race that he was way, way, way back. In fact, I should not tell you this, but my geniuses, my people, some of those people standing right there, right there, some of them right there, they said, Sir, do not get involved in that race, sir. You cannot come back from [CARDINAL] points, sir. It is too much. I said, But you know, I really like the guy. I think he is great. Let us give it a shot. They say, Sir, if you lose, they will never, ever It will be much worse. I said, Let me tell you, I know them very well. Whether I help him or do not help him, it is going to be the same. It is going to be a disaster. So let us help him. And we campaigned, and we worked hard, right? They said, Do not do it, sir. Do not do it. Please do not do it, sir. It will be very embarrassing. I said, No, I do not mind being embarrassed. I do not mind being embarrassed. We are also very proud that unemployment among [NORP] has reached the lowest rate in [DATE]. And we are building an amazing future for citizens of every background, race, religion, color, and creed. And that is what we have. That is what we have. Race, religion, color, and creed. But the radical left [NORP] want to demolish everything that we have gained. They want to raise your taxes. They want to bury you in regulation. They want to take away your health insurance, [CARDINAL] [NORP]. They want to erase [NORP] history, crush religious liberty, indoctrinate our students with left-wing ideology. And left-wing [NORP] want to confiscate your guns and eliminate your God-given right to self-defense. You know that. As your president, I will never allow them to take away your liberty, your dignity, and your social security. And I will never, ever allow them to take away your sacred right to keep and bear arms. The left tries to threaten, bully, intimidate [NORP] into submission. They use [NORP] prosecutors and phony congressional committees whenever they can. They will do whatever they can to demean you, to libel you. They try to blacklist, coerce, cancel, or destroy anyone who gets in their way. Look at what they are doing [DATE] to Justice [PERSON]. Look at what they are doing. Did you see [ORG]? Did you see what they are doing? Did you see what [NORP], they are calling for his resignation. They are calling for his impeachment. And the woman involved said she did not know anything. But they still, so [ORG] had to put out a major apology, and they had to change their story. The woman said, I do not remember that. Can you believe? And they still want him to be impeached. And I just put out a statement. And he is a great man, by the way, a great talent. A great brilliant man, [PERSON]. and I just put out a statement on social media that said, I do not think they will do it, but they should, for the good of the nation, I call for the resignation of everybody at [ORG] involved in the [PERSON] smear story. And while you are at it, the [NORP] witch-hunt hoax, which is just as phony a story. They have taken, the old gray lady, do you know [ORG], for [DATE], the old gray lady, so prestigious, they have taken the old great lady and broken her down, destroyed her virtue, and ruined her reputation. She can never recover, and will never return to greatness under current management. The [ORG] is dead. Long live [ORG]. Long lived [ORG]. And I do want it to live, but they have to be, they have to change their ways. Think of it, they wrote a story about somebody that said she does not remember this. Can you even believe it? And yet, all of these radical left crazies are in judiciary committee and all of these committees that are set up to hurt the country. With all that we have going, with [GPE], with [GPE], with [GPE] trade deal, with [GPE], with [GPE], with all that we have going, look at the cards that we have been dealt, lucky we won the election in [DATE], believe me. With all that we have going, they say, Let us impeach Justice [PERSON], [CARDINAL] of the smartest, most brilliant students, top at [ORG], incredible life, incredible family. Let us impeach him. It is a made-up story. Let us impeach President [SPEAKER]. Think of that. The Muller Report came out. Think of this. This crazy Mueller Report comes out, [CARDINAL] [SPEAKER] haters, liberal [NORP], some worked for [PERSON], they found nothing. No, think of it. After [DATE], they found nothing. They spent [MONEY]. There is not a person in the room that I could not find something on with that. They spent, think of it, they found nothing. No collusion, no obstruction, no nothing. To stop the far left's campaign of destruction, you must vote [NORP]. And you are going to get the chance very soon. We are joined [TIME] by many terrific [NORP] leaders, and somebody that is done an incredible job, she ran [GPE] for me. And as you know, for the presidential races, [GPE] had not been won in [DATE], and she kept saying, Could you come back, sir? I did not know who she was. I said, Who the heck is the woman in [GPE] that keeps asking? She said, Sir, if you keep coming back, you are going to win [GPE]. Has not been won in [DATE]. And I won [GPE]. Remember [TIME] great night? [DATE]. [TIME] great [TIME]. [SPEAKER] has won the great state of [GPE]. And they were going crazy on television. They were going, that was not a good night- Going crazy on television. They were going, that was not [TIME] for certain people. Remember the couple of people that were crying? I guess they do not like a strong military. They do not like cutting regulations. They do not like low taxes. They do not like Right to Try, you know Right to Try. All these things we have done. For the [ORG], we got choice. We got choice for the [ORG]. Choice. Everybody said it was impossible. We have rebuilt our military. I told this story for the first time [DATE]. A general came into my office in [DATE], you remember? It was a little dangerous out there. President [PERSON] left us with a few beauties, right? And I said to this general, You better be prepared, because this is looking like it could really be conflict. And he looked at me and he goes, Sir, we have very little ammunition. I said, Say it again. And I want to tell you the words, very little, he did not use because it was less than that. And I said, I never want to see a president in a position like that, where we may have conflict, and a general looks at him and said, 'We have very little/ no ammunition.' I never want a president of [GPE] to be in that position. And since then, [DATE], [MONEY] we have spent, then [MONEY]. And now, [MONEY]. And our military is by far the greatest in the world. There is nobody that even comes close. So anyway, no president should ever be put in that position. And by the way, no president should ever have to go through what I have gone through either. That should never happen. What happened is a disgrace to our country. No president should ever have to go through it. And I will tell you what, [PERCENT] of them would never have been able to take it. They would not have been able to take it. But we won the great state of [GPE], and now we are doing really well, because we have moved a lot of car companies. I tell [GPE], sorry, big deficits with all these countries, we are changing it, but you have got to get car companies. We are building car companies now in [GPE]. They are not going to be leaving for lots of other countries, including [GPE], including [GPE]. They are going to stay home, and they are going to pay you a lot of money, and everybody's going to be happy. But [GPE]'s doing great. And [PERSON] was the [ORG] chair of [GPE]. So when we won the election, I said, Let us get the woman from [GPE] to run the [ORG]. And she has done an incredible job. Thank you [PERSON]. A great gentleman who loves [ORG], co-chairman, [PERSON]. [PERSON], what a job. [GPE] [ORG] chairman. [PERSON]. My friend and a really talented guy, he just gets the hell knocked out of him all the time. [PERSON]. What a job he is doing, [PERSON]. Great job, [PERSON]. Great job. And another great friend of mine, somebody that was on [ORG], and they did not like him because he was too positive on [SPEAKER]. Can you believe it? He happens to be [NORP]. He happens to be [NORP], but I have never quite figured it out, because he looks more like a wasp than I do. So I have not figured that one out. But I will tell you what. There is nobody that loves his country more or [NORP] more than [PERSON], [PERSON]. Thank you [PERSON]. Nobody loves the [NORP] more. Who do you like more, the country or the [NORP]? He says the country. I do not know. I may have to go for the [NORP] to be honest. We got a lot of [NORP]. We love our [NORP]. Get out and vote. You know, just before the last election, the [NORP] from [GPE] where we got a tremendous percentage of the vote, [PERCENT]. they gave me the Bay of Pigs award. Can you imagine, right? The Bay of Pigs award. And the [NORP] and the [NORP] are all for [SPEAKER], I will tell you that. They are all for [SPEAKER]. They like what we are doing. With the help of, and [PERSON], I want to thank you very much by the way, and you were incredible on [ORG], and now you will get a real job. Okay? [PERSON], that audience was not big enough for you. Their ratings are not good. With the help of everyone here [TIME], we are taking power out of [GPE] and giving it back to the great people of our country, and to the people of [GPE]. We have cut a record number of job-killing regulations, saving the average [NORP] household $[MONEY], 000. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in [NORP] history. What that means is a typical family of [CARDINAL] in [GPE] making $[MONEY], 000 has seen their tax bill reduced by [MONEY] 000. And it is one of the reasons that as the world is not doing great, you look at Europe, and you look at Asia, and [GPE]'s not doing too well. I must be honest with you, worst [DATE] in [DATE], I'd say that is not good. But I hope they still like me. And we have taken in [MONEY] worth of tariffs, and we have given those tariffs, and by the way, [GPE]'s eating the tariffs, they are devaluing their currency, the prices are very similar. They are eating the tariffs. And out of [MONEY] we gave our great farmers, because they were targeted by [GPE], because [GPE] knows, very smart, that the farmers love [SPEAKER], and [SPEAKER] loves the farmers. I said to our Secretary of [ORG], [PERSON], I said, [PERSON], how much did the farmers get hit by [GPE] targeting them and pulling back and doing all sorts of things? He said, [MONEY]. I said, That is okay. We will take [MONEY] out of a much, much, much larger number. We are going to give it to the farmers, so that they are even. And I tell you, the farmers do love [SPEAKER], they do love [SPEAKER]. And to keep [GPE] farms, ranches, and small businesses in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax or death tax, so that you can now give your farm or your ranch to your children. Now, if you do not like your children, do not do it. But when it is your time to kick the bucket, you worked hard. You have great kids, you love your kids, they are taking care of you. You really love them. It is a great thing. If you do not love them, do not even listen to the last line, because it will not matter. Do not leave it to them. If they are not good, leave it to charity. Leave it to something else. Do not get it to them. I know a guy who cannot stand his children, they are horrible, horrible human beings. They are a little older now, but they are horrible human beings. He wants to leave his wealth. I said, Why would you leave them? They do not even like you. But on the assumption that you love your children, you will be able to use small farms and your ranches and things. You will be able to leave them to your children. Your children will not have to go out and borrow a fortune to pay tax. They will not be losing it to the banks [DATE]. We got rid of it. That is a big deal. Thank you. Thank you. Our shared [NORP] agenda is pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-growth, and [PERCENT] [NORP]. For [DATE], our leaders put global interests and special interests ahead of your interests. You know that, in [GPE], you know exactly what I am talking about. People came in, they took your jobs, they had no border, they had no border control. Look at what is going on now, how we are doing. I mean, honestly, I mentioned the president of [GPE]. We have [DATE] [CARDINAL] 000 [NORP] soldiers on the border protecting our country. And I will take it. Because our laws are so bad, they are so pathetic. And the [NORP] could change these laws. They could change them so quickly. We could change them all in [TIME]. We could, whether it is asylum, whether it is any of the laws, we have so many of them that are so bad. How they got that, it took [DATE] and [DATE] to end up. But we have the [NORP] soldiers out there. You see them, and they are stopping people. The numbers are plummeting down. So I just want to thank all of the representatives of [GPE]. Amazing. Well, we have got to get rid of the loopholes. You know, the word is loopholes, and the [NORP] could do it fast. But in the meantime, we are doing really well. And as the wall goes up, it becomes less and less of a problem, because as the wall gets up, people are not getting through. I mean you got to be a a world class pole vaulter, or a world class Mount Everest type climber. There is not too many around like that. It is really doing the trick. The failed liberal establishment in [GPE] squandered your tax dollars, shipped away your jobs, sacrificed your sovereignty, and bogged us down in [CARDINAL] foreign war, or debacle, call it whatever you want after another. And that is changing also, you see what is happening, and when these rich countries think we are going to pay for their military [DATE], [CARDINAL], and they are rich, and they take our business and we are supposed to, on top of everything else, I could tell you stories, but I am going to save them for the campaign. Because to be honest, this is a little earlier than the campaign. Wait until this campaign starts, you know, like I was telling [PERSON] and I was telling a few of the folks, [CARDINAL] thing I do not want to do, [PERSON] back there, [PERSON], hello. What a job he is done. But I am telling them I do not want to do this too early. I do not want to do it. You know the [NORP] thing, I did that, it was before its time. Right? It was before it is time. Too early. [DATE]. That means I have more [NORP] blood than she does, and I have none, unfortunately. I'd like to say I have a lot. Got to get me [PERCENT]. maybe [PERCENT]. but I was early with her, and frankly, oh it is coming back, do not worry about her. But [DATE] are over under this administration. We are finally putting [GPE] first. Putting it first. We are reversing [DATE] of calamitous trade policies that ravished our industries and devastated communities all across our land. You see the factories, empty buildings, empty hulks. Some have been demolished, some have been reconverted into senior citizen housing and housing. But all those jobs are gone, and we are bringing them back. They are coming back like almost never before. Probably, I can say they are coming back like never before. People are coming back now, because they want to be where the action is. And this is the country where they have the security, and where they do have the action. In [DATE] in office, I proudly withdrew from the last administration's job-destroying and this was a catastrophe. You know, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, this would have destroyed the automobile business in our country. Now [GPE], you know that you were totally devastated by another disaster known as NAFTA. Your state lost [PERCENT] of its manufacturing jobs after [ORG] was signed. This was one of the great catastrophes. And now we are replacing [ORG] with the brand new [GPE]-Mexico-Canada Agreement, [ORG]. Think of the song YMCA. [ORG]. Think of the song. [ORG], that is [GPE]-Mexico-Canada Agreement. And it is drawing strong Bipartisan support from all across your state, and all across the country. It is amazing. I want to just, yeah. [ORG], all [NORP] just unanimously endorsed the [ORG], and urged [ORG] to pass it immediately. Thank you very much commissioners. All [NORP]. Hopefully they will put it up for a vote. [PERSON], they put it up for vote. It is going to be very popular. The [NORP] love it, and the [NORP] love it, and frankly, labor loves it. Unions love it. Farmers love, love, love it, and everybody wants it. Your farmers, your ranchers, everybody wants it. It is an incredible agreement. And [GPE]'s already passed it, and [GPE]'s ready to pass it, soon as we do. See, they do not maybe trust us, that is why. They say, Why are not you passing it now? They say, Oh, we will pass it. They are going to pass it as soon as we do. Past leaders invited [GPE] to freely loot and pillage the [GPE] economy. [GPE]'s been taking out from [MONEY] a year. [CARDINAL], not [CARDINAL]. [CARDINAL]. Think of what [MONEY] is. We have rebuilt [GPE], but now it is a different ball game. Somebody had to do something with [GPE]. President [PERSON] should have done it. Presidents [PERSON] should have done it. President [PERSON] should have done it. They all should have done it. Frankly, they all should have done a lot of things that we are doing right now. So if you look at it, nobody did it, so I am doing it, and that is what is going to happen. We are doing well. So now we are taking in [MONEY] from [GPE]. When in the past, we never got [MONEY]. We never got money. We never got anything. You know what we got? Unemployment and losses. And some cheap pencils. More than we needed. You could do with [CARDINAL] less pencil. Following [DATE] of outsourcing and offshoring, our jobs and factories are coming back home where they belong. If foreign companies do not want to pay our tariffs, there is [CARDINAL] very simple solution. Come and make your product in [GPE]. Come and make your product in [GPE]. And by the way, I am just seeing this great group of people, this spirit, is there any place in the world that is more fun or more exciting than a [SPEAKER] rally? Really? Is there anything? When you think about it, it is not about fun. It is about achievement. Because what we have achieved in [DATE] is unparalleled. There is never been an administration that in [DATE] has done what we have been able to do or achieve. In [DATE], we will be up to [CARDINAL], sounds impossible, federal judges including court of appeals judges. Because President [PERSON] did us a great favor when I came in, I said, I assume I have no judges to appoint. No sir, you have [CARDINAL] judges. [CARDINAL]? Did not put them up, could not get them approved. I do not know what happened, but we started off with [CARDINAL], now we are up to [CARDINAL]. I just signed my 150th federal judge, and court of appeals judge, and we already have [CARDINAL] great [ORG] justices, [PERSON], and [PERSON]. Great, great men. So think of that. You know, you come in, and I have always heard the most important thing a president does, I disagree with this by the way, but that is okay. I disagree with a lot of things. Because I think the most important thing is our military, and protecting our country, right? But have you listened to the so-called [GPE] elite, now why are they elite? We do better than they do, we are smarter than them. We make more money, we have better houses, we have better everything, and then they say the elite. That means you are the super elite. I have always take offense when somebody said, [SPEAKER] is tired of listening to the elite. I said, No, no, I am more elite than them. Right? I think so. I mean, if we go by the old standards, better houses, better schools, made much more money, lived better, had everything going, and then I decide to run for president. And I will be honest, while we have to put up with these people, and others are, it is incredible. But it is the greatest single decision I have ever made, because our country is turning around so rapidly. I could not be happier, despite what they put us all through. Could not be happier. After [DATE] of building up other countries, we are finally building up our country. Is not that nice? It is time to finally take care of our own. And we are all so aggressively combating the opioid epidemic, which is horrible. And as a result of our nonstop efforts, and [MONEY] invested, [DATE] we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdose deaths, and it was a very big decline in [DATE]. [DATE]. And at the center of [GPE]'s drug crisis, this is where the [NORP] know it better than anybody. People said, Oh, the [NORP] will not like a wall. I said, I think they are going to love it. They will not like border security. I think they going to love it. You know why? Because you understand it better than other people, but at the whole center of this crisis is the drugs that are pouring in, and you understand that when other people do not understand it. The border crisis, [DATE] dangerous criminal cartels smuggle vast quantities of lethal narcotics across your Southern border, including heroin, meth, cocaine, and fentanyl, and we are stopping them now. You see the kind of numbers, we are getting [MONEY] worth. We have had some shipments where it could kill [CARDINAL] of the country, some of the fentanyl and some of the bad, really bad stuff. If it were distributed, it could actually, has the power to kill [CARDINAL] of the country. This is like a warlike situation. That is why you are liking [SPEAKER], because you are not going to let that happen. If you want to stop the drug smugglers and the human traffickers, how about the human traffic and they traffic really for the most part in women, that is what they traffic in, it is women. They are not trafficking in men. They capture women, and they bring them across the open borders, and they do not go through ports of entry, where you have guards standing there with guns and rifles and everything else. They go out into the desert areas, and they hang a left, or they hang a right and they come in, but now when you have a wall, they cannot do that. Right? They cannot do that. And so many of these [NORP] that are against the wall, it is common sense? Look, you know what I saw [DATE]? Where the [NORP] are having their convention, their national convention, they just gave out a tremendous contract. You know what it is for? They are building a big wall around the building, they are building a big wall. A massive wall. We should tell them, open borders. Let anybody come in. And [DATE], almost every one of these, they are on tape. That is the problem with politics. [DATE], they could say, look, I saw Senator [PERSON], I saw [PERSON] I saw all of them. They said, No, we need a wall. We must have a wall. President [PERSON], We must have a wall. We must stop people from coming into our country illegally. We have to stop it. We need a wall. Now, [DATE], they do not want a wall. You know why? Because anything I want, they want to do the opposite. And that is okay. That is the only reason. But if you want to stop the drug smugglers, human traffickers and vicious MS-3 gang members, which we are taking out [DATE] by the [CARDINAL], and getting them the hell out of our country, because of [ORG]. And if you want to stop all these people from threatening our communities and poisoning our youth, you know it is poisoning our youth. That is what it is, it is nothing other than that, it is very simple. They are poisoning our youth. You have [CARDINAL] choice. You must elect [NORP]. And to be honest with you, you have got to elect [SPEAKER]. We need [DATE]. [SPEAKER]. How about these phony [NORP]? They started with [GPE], [GPE], [GPE]. That turned out to be be a fraud. That turned out to be a fraud. Then they went to race. Do you believe that one? Race. I am the least racist person in this room. Then they went to recession, there is going to be a recession. Oh please, let there be a recession, please. Because we have a better chance of defeating him if there is a recession. And unfortunately, the stock market's only a few points from its all time high, which we have broken on, I think it is [CARDINAL] times. We broke the all time record. And now they have a new one. And I am enriching myself. Let me tell you, by doing this and taking this particular job, which I love, it will cost me [MONEY], but if somebody from the Middle East that I never saw before, comes in and stays in one of my hotels for an [TIME], and pays $[MONEY], emoluments. Nobody ever heard the word emolument before. Emolument, nobody ever heard that word, emolument. He is enriching himself. If somebody buys a tank of gas in [GPE], from an airport that I do not own, and they happen to go to a hotel, he is enriching himself, like [CARDINAL] people, I am going to lose [MONEY], and that is okay. I expected to do that when I did it. I did not know what would happen if I lost. Can you imagine? Supposing I lost, and we would have had the same basic rhetoric. I mean, winning was great. Supposing, you know, I am doing all the things. I am telling you all the same sort of things. Supposing I did not make it. I'd have to go around. I would've lost and lost [CARDINAL], then I would have been really unhappy. But I will tell you what, I expected that when I did this, in terms of opportunity, in terms of certain places, they can never do as well when you have this kind of rhetoric, they can never do. So I will lose [MONEY], always expected. They say, I enrich myself because somebody is going to stay at my hotel. It does not work that way folks. And these are very, very dishonest people, and they know it. So they have given up on every other hoax, but it does not work that way. You know it too. You get it. The [NORP] agenda of open borders places vast burdens on your communities, and your schools, and your hospitals, and public safety all at the expense of hardworking [GPE] families, and throughout our country. Sheriffs, and commissioners from [CARDINAL] [GPE] counties recently sent a letter to your state's congressional delegation begging them to vote for strong border security they want in [GPE]. They do not want open borders. They do not want criminals pouring into your communities, and doing what they do, and we will not even talk about that. They want strong, these are people that are with you in many cases, [NORP]. They write letters, we need strong border security. In [GPE], [GPE] is very difficult. Always complaining, not doing great, but they wanted a wall in [GPE], good mayor in [GPE] by the way. They wanted a wall. And I said, You know what, let us build it someplace else. Because [GPE], you know, once we build it, they will complain. But then I said, You know, the people are pouring in. They needed it. They are pouring into [GPE], like going all over the place. And people that had houses, they did not like people running over their gardens [DATE], coming in from the other side. So we put up a wall, and I thought everybody would be happy. As soon as it was finished, [DATE] it was finished, I was notified. We did not want the wall. Why did you do the wall? And I will tell you, in other words, it is all a game. I'd love to take the sucker down and move it right now to [GPE]. And if I did that, they'd go crazy. And they'd say, Please sir, do not do that. Please, please. The same people that are saying, We do not want a wall. Why did you put up a wall? And I knew that was going to happen. I told my people that was going to happen. But they are very happy with their wall. Most of them will not say it. They love it. It stopped it only stopped [PERCENT] of the people coming in. And the only reason I am not moving it to [GPE] is that it would cost more money to move it than to build you a brand new, beautiful wall, so I will give you a brand new beautiful wall. New beautiful wall, I will give you a brand-new one. It is true. It is true. I actually priced it out. It is true. These contractors, all my life I have been deal They can find a way to make money. Sir, it'll cost more money to move the wall that they built a new one. They have it, but the commission your commissioners wrote, I quote, Our communities do not have the resources nor the budgets to handle the massive influx of immigrants we are experiencing. This is your commissioners writing to us in [GPE]. Our scarce resources are in danger of being rapidly depleted to the point that we will be unable to effectively care for our own citizens, you, and our existing homeless populations, many of whom are [NORP] veterans, right? So, [NORP] put illegal aliens before [NORP] citizens. [NORP] believe that we must take care of our own citizens first. I am sorry. That includes [CARDINAL] of hardworking, lawful immigrants who waited in line, followed the rules, and came into our country legally. And among those hardest hit by illegal immigration are [NORP] who obey our laws, pay their taxes, contribute to our communities and play by the rules, and they are the ones that want to see something done and we are doing it at a level that nobody else would be capable of doing it. Whether you are a first generation or a 10th generation, every [NORP] citizen deserves a government that defends your jobs, your safety, your family, and is always loyal to you. Your politicians have not been loyal to you. They have been loyal to themselves. The [NORP] are also trying to turn every city in [GPE] into a sanctuary for criminal aliens, and that is [CARDINAL] of the very good reasons we won on [DATE] [TIME], [GPE], because they let people out of their sanctuary city and what those people did, I will not tell you [TIME], but it was not good. It is [CARDINAL] of the reasons we had big victories, [CARDINAL] of them in [GPE], sanctuary cities. And plenty of people, even in [GPE] where they have sanctuary cities, they do not want sanctuary cities. The politicians do, but they do not want them. Right here in [GPE], [NORP] are trying to turn you into a total sanctuary state, creating a safe harbor for dangerous criminal aliens and gang members that sanctuary policies release from jail. Now, think of it. They want to make your whole state a sanctuary state. So, when MS-13 comes in, and I told you before, we take them out by the [CARDINAL] and they are tough. They are tough, but our [ORG] folks are even tougher. There is nobody tougher. I would say naive, but maybe it is much worse than that. They are naive, these politicians. The naive politicians, they do not want [ORG] to come in. They do not want to take these criminals out. And if you do not take them out and they are in [GPE], I got to tell you something, folks. You got problems. You got problems. You have got big problems. [NORP] believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law abiding [NORP], not for criminal aliens. And [NORP] will always support the heroes of [ORG], border patrol and our great law enforcement. The [NORP] party Do you notice I always say the [NORP] party? You know, before I came, they were all calling it [NORP] because it sounds better, right? It does. It is much nicer. [ORG] is much nicer than the [NORP] party, but their name is [ORG], and I am not looking for them to sound nice. I want to give their name. So, I always say [ORG], but that is their name, [ORG]. Frankly, they should probably change it because it does And then I'd call them [ORG], but the [NORP] party has never been farther outside the mainstream. Every major That is a nasty fly. I do not like those suckers. I do not know about you in [GPE], but I am not into flies or mosquitoes. I do not like snakes too much. We have plenty of them in [GPE] and [GPE], a different variety. I do not like snakes either. We got a lot of snakes in [GPE]. We got a lot of steaks in [GPE]. I do not like either kind of snake. I think I like the kind on the ground better than the ones we have in [GPE]. Every major [NORP] running for president supports a massive government takeover of healthcare that would destroyed [ORG] as we know it [DATE]. My administration will protect [ORG] and defend your right to choose the plan and the doctor that is best for you. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. The [NORP] will always do that. Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in [DATE]. You do not hear this because the fake news does not want to write about it. Sometimes I will have a news conference about something that is so good and I will say, you know I will call my wife, first lady, first lady. People love our first lady. I will say, Wait until you see television [TIME], and we did something that was so great, whatever it may be. We did a lot of things. We did something so great and it will not be on, but if there is something that is just slightly negative or even if it is good that they could turn negative, that is what they like best. Take something good and turn it negative. It is breaking We have breaking news. We have breaking news. These are phony people, but that is okay. You know, when you think of it, I am president and they are not. Crazy. It is crazy. You know, sometimes I will be in the oval office and I will be with my people. We have great people, and I will say, You know, and it is great comm in the oval office. You do not like to hear about it because you do not hear about it too much. That is not what they But we have great comm considering it is pretty wild stuff going on in the world, right? But I will be saying, You know, they do not treat us right. They do not treat us right. It is not fair. It is not this. And then I will just sit back, I will say, But we are in the oval office and they are not. It is pretty amazing. It is pretty amazing. And when you have the [NORP] party and the press, the media, the lame stream media, the fake news, and they are partners They are partners, okay? Remember the word Manufactured? They used the word manufacturer on something, never been used for that thing, and every news gets The manufactured crisis started. The next one, This crisis was manufactured. Every one of them used the word Manufactured. They know what I am talking about now. Now, that is called collusion, folks. That is real collusion. You have that, and so you have the [NORP], you have the media, their partners. Then you have the deep state. We are getting rid of a lot of them. I will tell you, we are finding them left and right. Boom. You take a look at what I will tell you what. I will tell you what. You take a look at what we are doing with all of the things. I am not going to get into detail, but you know what I am talking about. Clean the swamp. That is the ultimate cleaning of the swamp. And then I hate to say this, but we have some [NORP], they are not good. You call them a rhino. They are rhinos. The rhinos are worse, and some of them are worse than the [PERSON] people, right? They are worse than the [PERSON] people. They are worse than the [PERSON] people, but there are not too many of them left. They are pretty much on respirators. They are gasping. They are gasping for air, but we do have some bad people that you would not believe. I did not hear you. Why did you say why? What? I did not hear that. Virtually, every top [NORP] also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mothers right up until the moment of birth, and that is why I have asked [ORG] to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because [NORP] believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. It is true. Right? I see it. Just like mom, I see it. [NORP] are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, and socialism. The [NORP] party is the party of the [NORP] worker, the [NORP] family, and it is the party of the [NORP] dream. We have achieved record funding for the [GPE] military. All of that money, [MONEY] spent all produced right here in the good old [GPE]. And I have to tell you, [GPE], I know you are going to like this. A lot of those [CARDINAL] because you know when you do the [CARDINAL] and the [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] all of a sudden you are in [CARDINAL] and I can save a lot of lines when I just say [CARDINAL]. A lot of that money's going to be spent in the state of the art military equipment that is being used at [FAC], [FAC], [FAC] and many other vital [GPE] military installations that are going up as we speak. That is also jobs, but more importantly than even jobs, incredible. What you have done for the military, [GPE], is incredible and we have remembered, but we are pouring a lot of money into [GPE] and that means a lot of good things. And we are investing in our nation's nuclear security, including right here in [GPE] and [ORG] and [ORG]. To protect [NORP] security, I withdrew [GPE] from the horrible [CARDINAL]-sided [GPE] nuclear deal. It was no good and we oppose the toughest ever sanctions on the [NORP] regime. Watch how that works out, folks. That'll be very good. I recognized [GPE]'s true capitol and opened the [NORP] embassy in [GPE]. And do not forget what I did for [GPE] with respect to Golan Heights. Do not forget, right? For [DATE], you watched as your politicians apologize for [GPE]. Now, you have a president who is standing up for [GPE] and we are standing up for [GPE]. And you must never forget. Get out there and vote and get ready and get everybody. We need it because we are fighting a lot of forces, including [ORG], I saw, and [ORG], I saw. Did you see [ORG]? He said I may have lost [CARDINAL] votes, according to this character that worked at [ORG], right? And we still won. How the hell did we win? Everybody was against us. How did we win? How did we win? This is a [ORG] executive. From [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL] votes, and we won. I do not know, we must be doing I will say this. That happened and people came from the valleys. They came from everywhere. They Came from places that nobody's ever talked about before and it was the forgotten men and women, but the truth is I know these men and women and they are the most incredible men and women in this country. They really are. They just never had anybody they really wanted to vote for or at least for a long time, they did not want to get out there. They said, Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Is this the best they can do? I mean, in all fairness, I do not want to go too early here. Look at the field. Did you watch the debate [DATE]? We have got [CARDINAL] people. I will take it. That is the best they can do. We will see. We will see. You never want to get too cocky. Somebody said in the great state of [GPE], [SPEAKER] is down [CARDINAL] points to [PERSON]. [PERSON]. [PERSON]. They are phony polls. You know they have phony polls. I told this story [TIME]. For [DATE], I was hearing that I am going to lose the state of [GPE] and friends of mine from [GPE] that look just like these guys. See these [CARDINAL] guys with the hates? They might even be better looking. They look just like And they want to say, I do not know about you, but I know a lot about [GPE] and [SPEAKER] is not going to be losing the state of [GPE]. Remember that? See, they do not say it is in play. They are too smart. They say [GPE] is in play. And [GPE], they said was it play. All these are in play and play means we could lose them, right? It is a better term though because this way, they cannot get skunked, but they can get skunked with me. So, what happens is on that beautiful election Was that [CARDINAL] of [DATE] ever? Well, they can never call a victory unless you absolutely have it and unless you are winning by a lot. This is [DATE]. [GPE] is in play. You know, he could lose [GPE]. I keep saying, I go to a stadium, we sell out to [CARDINAL] of people, lines that are [QUANTITY] long. I mean, and every friend of mine says, You are going to win by a lot. So, they announce [TIME], whatever time, The polls in [GPE] are closed. [SPEAKER] has won this state of [GPE]. The polls in [GPE] are closed. [SPEAKER] has won the state of [GPE]. They do not even take a breath. Now, if it is close like it is in play, you wait [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] five hours to see what it is, but they do not even a breath because they are called suppression poles and they are no different than all of the dishonest reporting that you people see. They are no different. They are suppression polls, and I will tell you what. We are going to win the state of [GPE] and I will be so surprised if we do not . I will be so surprised. No, we are going to win [GPE]. You know, when I came here during the last election, came here a little because I was told very hard to win and I came here a little, but I saw great spirit. But I did not really have a track record because I never did this stuff before. So, I said I was going to cut your taxes. I did. I said I was going to cut your regulations. I did more than any president in history and they have been there for [DATE]. I have been there for [DATE]. And I think the regulation cutting Like the Waters of the US, that was another beauty where you could not build a house, you could not farm your land. Now, what we have done on regulations is incredible. I have done I have rebuilt our military, I have taken care of our vets. Look how happy our vets are with choice. Instead of waiting for [DATE] to see a doctor or [DATE] or [DATE], they now go out. If there is a wait, they go out, they get a private doctor. They get taken care of. We pay the bill. And for the first time, they have tried to get that for [DATE], they have not been able to get it, but I am good at getting things. You must never forget. The [DATE] election is about [CARDINAL] thing. What is it about? It is about you. It is. It is about you. It is about you. I am doing a good job as your messenger, but basically I am a messenger. I know what you want. I understand that it is about your family. It is about your future, and it is about the fate of your country for your children, for everybody. It is about the fate of your country. It is about the future of our great country. No matter what label they use, a vote for any [NORP] in [DATE] is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the [NORP] dream. That is what it is about. Look at [GPE]. [GPE], [DATE], was one of the wealthiest countries in the world and [DATE], very sad. No food, no water, no nothing. Socialism. We begin this campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for [GPE]. And it is not just a little bit positive. Our country is going to be greater than it ever was. That is where we are headed. Together, we will help [CARDINAL] more citizens know the dignity of work, the pride of a paycheck and the satisfaction of a job really well done. With your help, we will elect a [NORP] [ORG] to create a safe, modern, fair, and very lawful system of immigration. And we are going to have a lot done anyway. We already do have a lot done. You saw the figures [DATE], but we are doing it the hard way. It would be so much easier with a little stroke of the pen. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, that incredible phrase, Made in the [GPE]. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in [GPE] within [DATE], and we have already started that program. It will happen. We have the medicine. Nobody even knew that. The AIDS epidemic in this country will be gone within [DATE]. We have already started the process. It is been funded. It is been funded. Who would've thought that? Honestly, when I ran, I did not know that. We have now the technology and what they have done with respect to AIDS is incredible. What a terrible, terrible period of time the world went through, but we will have it ended within [DATE]. We will defeat the effort to drive up the cost of houses, cars, healthcare, light bulbs. Right? They took away our light bulb. I want an incandescent light. I want to look better, okay? I want to pay less money to look better. Does that make sense? You pay much less money and you look much better and on top of that, with the new bulbs, if they break, it is considered a hazardous waste site. It is all gases inside and you are supposed to bring it back to where you bought it in a sealed container. Give me a break. I asked the people, the professionals, Well, what do people do when it breaks? Because they break all the time. What do they do? Nothing, they throw it away. A lot of people did not know. They did not understand. You got a much better light at a much reduced cost and it is much safer because when those other bulbs break, they really are dangerous. The gases come out, they are dangerous. These are the little things that I have to explain. Otherwise, people will say, What the hell are you doing with light bulbs for? And we are trying to do the same thing with cars. Cars have so much junk on them now to save a tiny little fraction of gasoline. They have so much junk that they are less safe. So, what I want to do is the following. Under our rules and regulations, the cars are environmentally terrific, but they are safer and they are $[MONEY], 500 less to buy, right? And the reason they are safer is because they could be a little bit heavier. Makes sense, right? They could be a little bit heavier. I mean, they make them now like paper mache. Somebody touches them and the entire car collapses. When somebody hits me, I want to be in as close to an army tank as possible. No, they are made out of paper mache. They weigh [QUANTITY] and if you get hit by a bus, it is over. They say, What happened to that car? No, I think of it, it is safer and it is less expensive by $[MONEY], 500 on average. And [GPE] wants you to do the other cars and we do not . We are going to end up in a big litigation and I am fighting for you. Look. Look, it is not the kind of thing most presidents would be fighting for because they say, Let them pay more. Let it be unsafe. They listen to the environmentalists, and I am an environmentalist. I believe in the environment. I want the cleanest water on the planet. I want the cleanest air. I want a lot of things. You know, right now, we have the cleanest air that we have ever had in this country? But what are they going to do about [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] and other countries that are spewing stuff? What are we doing about them? We are going to keep our nation clean. But you know, the universe is so big that when you talk about [GPE], the [GPE], [GPE], you talk about these different places where a lot of bad stuff comes out, right? It is so big that it is right next to each other. It is right next to each other. Does that make sense? Right? It is right next to each other. So, what are they going to do? We want to have the cleanest water and the cleanest air. We will defend privacy. We will defend free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and we will always defend your second amendment and we are doing it now. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one [GPE]. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with our incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and in the sanctity of life. We believe that mothers and fathers, not [GPE] bureaucrats, know best how to raise their strong, beautiful families in their loving and wonderful communities. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great [NORP] flag. And we will always live by the words of our national motto. Nobody will ever take it down. Nobody will ever take it down. We will never allow them to take it down. In God we trust. We stand on the shoulders of [NORP] [NORP] who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth and we are going to be better than ever before and it will not even be close, and we are right there. Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered sciences, won [CARDINAL] world wars, defeated fascism and communism, put a man on the moon and built the most exceptional country in the history of the world. And [DATE] of my presidency, we will never forget that we are [NORP] and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to each and every one of you. Right? With your help, your devotion and your drive Gee, it is too bad. He did it right in the crescendo. How do you top that? I just readied the big beautiful crescendo and this character's going back home. It is all right. It is [CARDINAL] people [TIME]. Remember, when they say Massive protest at the [SPEAKER] rally, [CARDINAL] people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning in a win like never before. We are [CARDINAL] movement, [CARDINAL] people, [CARDINAL] family and [CARDINAL] glorious nation under God. [GPE] is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of the great state of [GPE], we love you. The best is yet to come. Best is yet to come. Thank you, [GPE]. And together, we will make [GPE] wealthy again. Very, very wealthy. We will make [GPE] strong again. We will make [GPE] safe again, and we will make [GPE] great again. Thank you. [GPE]. Thank you. Thank you, [GPE]. Thank you. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsdonaldtrumpcampaignspeechtranscriptvandaliaohioseptember21", "text": "Well thank you very much, [GPE]. Thank you very much. Thank you. You know, this is really not a rally, you know this, this has to do with workers, programs, all the things we love, but this is really, we call it a friendly protest. And you know what we are protesting? We are protesting stupidity. Because there is so many stupid things you see here. But hello, I will tell you what [GPE], how good have you been? How good have you been? What did we win by? A lot. And your governor's here, and he just said you are winning by a lot more this time than last time. So that is good. Thank you. [PERSON], thank you very much. But hello, [GPE]. And thank you very much. I am thrilled to be here in [GPE], the home of [ORG], wow. I wonder what they would think when they see some of these F-35s and these crazy planes that we make nowadays that go [QUANTITY], right? I wonder. But I want to just thank the very hard working patriots who are the backbone of [GPE]. You really are. You are the backbone of [GPE]. This is an amazing group of people. This is an amazing group. You know, I am going to another very nice spot in [GPE] where we do have a rally, but I cannot imagine you have many more people than we have here, but they will, [CARDINAL] times more. No, this is for us and our friends and workers. We want workers. [DATE], We are going to win this state. We are going to win [DATE] in [FAC]. That is true. Thank you. Thank you. You had your best year in the history of your state and the history of our country [DATE]. And we had it until the plague came in, and now we are building it up again rapidly, but you had [DATE], and we are going to have [DATE] will be [DATE] we have ever had. I believe that. You will see that in [DATE]. But we are here [DATE] to talk about jobs. We are talking about jobs, a very favorite subject of mine to know and to understand that the choice in [DATE] is going to be very simple. There is never been a time where there is such a difference. [CARDINAL] is probably communism. I do not know. They keep saying socialism. I think they are gone. They have got over that one, that one's passed already. [PERSON] spent [DATE] shipping your jobs to [GPE], and foreign countries. You know that. And I have spent [DATE] bringing the jobs back to our country, and back to [GPE]. On [DATE], [NORP] will decide whether we lift our nation to soaring new heights of prosperity, or whether we will allow [PERSON], [PERSON], to shut down our economy, impose a [CARDINAL], that is with a T, by the way, [MONEY] tax hike, abolish [GPE] clean coal, oil, natural gas, and ship your jobs and factories and dreams overseas to [GPE] and countries that you have never even heard of. Put simply, if [PERSON] wins, [GPE] wins. If we win, [GPE] wins, and most importantly, in all fairness, [GPE] wins. Because you finally have a president who puts [GPE] first. And I do put [GPE] first. I guess that is why [DATE], that is why I did this, right? It is because of this, probably more than any other reason. I watched the jobs going out. I never saw anything so stupid in my life. I watched the worst trade deals, and we have reversed many of them, almost all of them now, but we have reversed them. And again, we were having [DATE] we have ever had, and it is going to be back very soon. You take a look at what is happening. We are joined [DATE] by a real good friend of mine. Somebody that is been with me from the beginning. And I have been with him from the beginning, [GPE] Governor, [PERSON]. Where is [PERSON]? Where is [PERSON]? He is opening up. Where is [PERSON]? Thank you, [PERSON]. Thank you, [PERSON]. He is a good man. And Lieutenant governor [PERSON]. Good guys. Yeah. Thanks [PERSON]. Good job. Congressman [PERSON], do you know [PERSON]? Wow. [PERSON], that is very impressive. These are real warriors. I will tell you another one, [PERSON]. Do we know [PERSON]? Hell of a lawyer. Thank you, [PERSON]. Thanks for all the help too, both of you, really appreciate it. And a man, I do not know if you know him. He should become legendary, because when we did not have a lot of support, I had a guy named [PERSON], do you know [PERSON]? He kept saying, every time I said, You know, we are not getting the kind of support from the top people. He said, That is okay, sir, you went up another [CARDINAL] points. We won this state by a lot. Remember the fake news. It is a lot of it back there too, a lot of fake news. But they were going around [PERSON], hey [PERSON], they were going around saying, Well, [PERSON] may not be able to, in order to when you have to win [GPE], right? And then for [DATE], I heard, You cannot win unless you win the great state of [GPE]. But they did not say the great state, I say the great state. And I heard it. I heard it for so long. It would be impossible. And then we won [TIME] by what? [CARDINAL] points? What was it [PERSON]? [CARDINAL] points. We won by a lot. In fact, it was the first indication that that was going to be a tough night for the [NORP]. They said, Ladies and gentlemen, not only did [PERSON] win [GPE], he won by a hell of a lot more than we anticipated. And then we won, look at these guys. That is why I love these guys. Look at this. Nobody's messing with these guys. You know, they are great workers, but we use them also for security. If everyone gets a little bit rough, you will take care, right fellas? Thank you very much. Thank you. But we won it big, and that was the beginning of [CARDINAL] of [DATE] in history, because we did something in [DATE] that was amazing. And I will tell you, honestly, there is more enthusiasm now, and this is fact. In fact, they have a new thing. First of all, you know, we are working very hard on getting a third [ORG] Justice. I am going to announce who that is. The only thing I will say, for the women, it will be a woman. Uh oh. There are a lot of angry people. Okay. Here is the question. Okay. It will be a woman. Does anybody here, please raise your hand if you have the courage, is there anybody here that insists that it will be and should be a man? Is there anybody with the courage, please put up your hand right now. A lot of women here. So, okay. Ready? [ORG] Justice, most powerful, most important, just the most important, you know, when you become president, they say, This is the single most important thing a president does, is pick [ORG] And by the way, by the end of the first term, we will have [CARDINAL] federal judges, a record. So let us give me a free poll. We do this, I have such fun with it. We do it. Give me a free poll. If they go out, they charge [MONEY]. They interview like [CARDINAL] people, which mean nothing. Here we got a lot of people. So give me a free poll, who would like to see a woman Justice of [ORG]. Who would like to see a male Justice of [ORG]. The only one I hear there is women. Some women. What is that all about? No, it will be a brilliant person. It will be, I have [CARDINAL] that we are vetting right now. It will be a brilliant person. It will be a woman. It will be a woman. And we are looking forward to it. And it will probably announce it on [DATE], maybe [DATE], but [DATE]. And it is [DATE] for our country. It is [DATE] for you. It is [DATE] for [GPE]. And so I think it will be great. I always love, why'd you say that? Like big day for [GPE], and I do it somewhat routinely. Do you ever notice when [PERSON] goes out, and he always picks the wrong location. Like if he is in [GPE], it is great to be in the state of [GPE]. And he looks around, and he does not see too many palm trees. He says, Are we in [GPE]? No, you are not. He did that [CARDINAL] times. How do you do that? When you do that, you just walk off the stage. It is over. There is nothing you can do. You can make the greatest remainder of the speech, there is nothing you can do to save it. But the people of [GPE] know better than anyone, the terrible damage that [PERSON] has inflicted over [DATE], [DATE] to be exact. Can you believe it? For [DATE], [PERSON] shook the hands of [NORP] workers, and then stabbed them in the back. He said, [GPE] vultures. I mean, think of it, all over, and they raked in cash. They raked in big money. Where is his son? Where is he? Where is his son? I will tell you. Where is he? What did I say, Where is, Where is he? Go ahead. You know, we did that for fun. Where is [PERSON]? We did a t-shirt. That thing sold, we come up with these little gems. Where is [PERSON]? You know where he is? Yeah. He is in the basement with his father. Where is [PERSON]? No, [PERSON] did very well. He had no job, he was thrown out of the military, he was thrown out. He had no job. And then he goes to [GPE], and he gets [MONEY] a month. Although he had no experience whatsoever, knew nothing about the subject of the company, which you know, was energy. I think they got an upfront payment of [CARDINAL] energy. I think they got an upfront payment of [CARDINAL] just to be able to get them. Think of that, $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] a month and [MONEY] upfront payment. How about that? I'd take that one myself. Then they go to [GPE], he walks out with [CARDINAL] to manage, which is [MONEY] a year. The whole thing is crazy and the fake news does not want to cover it. They do not want to cover it. Did you see the interview [DATE] with [PERSON], [TIME]? That was softball, that was like, Here, [PERSON]. So we will see. We have a debate coming up and who knows, look he is been doing this You know what, he is been doing it for [DATE]. I have been doing it for [DATE], so he should be able to beat me I would think, he is much more experienced. He is great, oh, he is a beauty. But he betrayed you, he lied to you, he abused you, which is why it is time to retire [PERSON], this is serious stuff. Do we have any [ORG] here? [ORG], any [ORG] here? That is all? [CARDINAL]. All right, well, I did a big favor for the [ORG], they had trucking company. I think [CARDINAL] 000 jobs going out. [PERSON] called up, Could you help? Could you help? Could you help? I helped, I kept that company going. They saved [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] jobs, but then [DATE] they always endorse the [NORP], does not matter, good or bad. And [PERSON], I am so disappointed in that guy. So I called, I said, I'd love to get their support. Oh, I am sorry, sir. They have already endorsed sleepy [PERSON]. It is like automatic, but you know who does not endorse him, all the workers underneath and they will either throw him out or he will retire. He will retire. You get tired of it, it is like automatic. They endorse the [NORP] because the [NORP] do whatever the hell they want. But the workers, the people underneath, the real people, they are with us all the way. I have hired [CARDINAL] and thousands of [ORG], all the concrete work on buildings in [GPE]. But they just like wedded. It is almost like a habit. I consider it a habit and I think it is disgraceful. But I saved this company, a big company, good company, great people. We saved it. And then you say unrelated, totally unrelated, Hey, we'd love to have you. Well, I am sorry, it is already done. These people are terrible, but that is all right. You always have to remember things. Remember, you got to remember, right workers? On [DATE], we must turn the page forever on the failed corrupt political class. That is what it is. They get so much things that are so unfair to the rest of our country and that is why they are always with that top level of [NORP] but the workers are with us. [PERSON] is a diehard globalist. [NORP] are out, you know that right? Globalist destroyed, they helped destroy this country. I will tell you if I did not come along, I really mean it. This country was, it was going down and we stopped it. If you look at your Second Amendment, if you look at so many different things, no matter what it is. You look at our jobs, our jobs prior to the plague and now coming back. The housing is record setting. Car manufacturing is record setting. You take a look at car sales are record setting. Retailing, who would think retail is record setting. It is amazing because we had such a good foundation. We closed it up, we saved [CARDINAL] of lives. We had no choice, we had to do that. And then we opened it and now we are rocking and it is going good. It is really going good. But the [NORP] really waged war on the [NORP] workers for [DATE]. Look what they have done. [PERSON]'s policies destroyed [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] factories and killed [CARDINAL] point, think of it, [CARDINAL] manufacturing jobs. We brought back [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] when they said, right, they said the magic wand, you cannot do it, manufacturing jobs are gone. I said, Really? I do not think so. [PERSON] championed the NAFTA disaster and [GPE]'s entry into [ORG], which was a total catastrophe. That is when [GPE] started going up like a rocket. They are considered in the world trade, they are considered a developing nation. No, they are not a developing nation. By being a developing nation they get all sorts of advantages over us. So we have been protesting it and we do things that you would not believe. You do not even want to hear about it because it is disgraceful. [GPE] is a developing nation. And therefore for [DATE] and [DATE], they had big advantages over [GPE] but no more. What followed was the nothing short, and think of it, nothing short of a blue collar carnage and it was in [GPE] and [GPE], and [GPE], [GPE], [GPE]. You know how many car plants we are bringing back to [GPE]. Nobody's ever seen it. For [DATE], they did not build a plant. And now they are building them all over. And I tell countries, I told a great gentleman, he just retired, Prime Minister [PERSON] of [GPE]. I said, [PERSON], you got to build plants here, you cannot do this. You are building your cars in [GPE] and sending them. We want our cars built here. We want cars built here. He said, Well, that is not up to me, that is up to the company. That is all right, [PERSON], I know you can do it. [DATE] they announced [CARDINAL] plants, I mean, what can I tell you? I know my people, it is up to [PERSON], it was not up to anybody else, but he is great. The workers of [GPE] will never forget [PERSON]'s economic treachery. They will remember in [DATE] after [PERSON] betrayed and think of it, all the betrayals on [ORG] and [GPE], [PERCENT] of all of the manufacturing jobs were shipped out of [GPE]. And now the good thing is your roads, you did not have a lot of traffic. So that is the good news, everything else was bad, right? It was everything else was bad. [CARDINAL] [GPE] families saw their jobs disappear [TIME]. By [DATE], the per capita income in [GPE] had fallen [PERCENT] below the national average of $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY]. Remember this, this all happened I mean, these numbers are incredible what is happened in [DATE]. [GPE] lost [CARDINAL] in [CARDINAL] manufacturing jobs, [CARDINAL] out of [CARDINAL] iron and steel mill jobs. And [CARDINAL] of its auto jobs, courtesy of [PERSON] and that crew, that group, that whole ideology. And now of course his ideology has changed. He is so far left that he is just so you understand, he has no choice. It is not him. He is being pulled left. You see where [PERSON], [PERSON], she another great one that one. You see her poll numbers, her poll numbers were going down and I cannot nobody treated him worse than [PERSON], right? And she said the [PERSON] administration and working with [PERSON], did you see that? But he said worse, he said the [PERSON], right, he said the [PERSON], [PERSON] administration. And I heard that, I actually heard that live, although it is not real live, I will tell you. It is sort of [CARDINAL] gone, it is shot, it is shot. But he said the [PERSON], [PERSON] administration will and that is where it is. Look, this guy is shot. I mean, if he makes it, it is going to be I am going to come back to [GPE] and I am going to say what the hell happened? I will have lost to the worst presidential candidate in the history of politics. I really believe that. The guy cannot speak without the teleprompter, although I am telling you, I am telling you, I think she says [inaudible 00:27:10]. I hope you are right. I hope you are Thank you. I hope you are right. I tell you the country cannot afford it. [CARDINAL] thing I have learned is that President [PERSON] of [GPE], President [PERSON] of [GPE], [PERSON], [GPE], every one of these leaders, they are not shot. And we cannot have somebody that is sleepy. We cannot have a sleepy guy negotiating. Oh, would they like to see him though? Did you see, would they like to see [PERSON]? It is their dream to see [PERSON]. How about [GPE], you think around might like to see [PERSON]? They'd go back, they say give me [MONEY]. We gave them [CARDINAL]. We gave them [MONEY] in cash. You know what that looks like, [MONEY] in cash? And I will tell you what, if and when we win, we will get a call within [TIME] after the victory and it'll be [GPE], it is going to want to make a deal. We want them to make a deal. We want them to be good. We want them to be strong. They just cannot have a nuclear weapon. That is all, it is very simple. You cannot have a nuclear weapon. But I told people, I said, Do not talk to them now, look, they want to wait. This is the gift. If they could do that, if [GPE] could do it, I mean, think of it. If [GPE] could do it, by the way, nobody's been tougher on [GPE] than me with the sanctions. With the I exposed, right, [FAC], that is the pipeline. No, you never heard of [FAC] until I came along. I said to [GPE], let me get this straight. We defend [GPE], right? We defend [GPE] and that is it. They do not pay what they are supposed to pay, they are delinquent, they are delinquent. So I said to [PERSON] and I like [PERSON], but I said, but she is smart, why should she pay if she does not have to. So I said, [PERSON], so we defend you against [GPE] and you pay [MONEY] to [GPE]. How does that work? Explain to me what is that all about? But you never heard about that stuff. We'd give tank busters to [GPE]. We sell them in theory, I do not know if we will ever get the money. We sell them. But he gave pillows, maybe he got them from [PERSON], the pillow man. You think when [PERSON] sent pillows over to [GPE], I send tank busters, they sent pillows. And the fake news goes, oh. Let me tell you, we have been very rough but at the same time we get along. I like [PERSON], he likes me. We get along. Would not you say it is smart to get along, okay, it is smart. I get along or I got along with President [PERSON], but I do not know, after what happened here I am having a hard time with [GPE], I really am. They are buying a lot, the trade deal has been incredible. They have been living up to it in all fairness. The largest order of corn in the history of our country, largest order of soybeans, largest cattle order. But it means less now, you understand. If we would not have been hit with this pandemic, which they could've stopped, it would have meant a lot. But it just means a lot less to me right now. So now after selling you out and bleeding you dry, [PERSON] is back asking for your vote. The guy, when he was in prime time, which for him was about halftime. Long time ago, I had a friend, a senator, a [NORP], believe it or not. I used to get along with [NORP] very well, actually better than the [NORP], but I will not say that. But I asked him, Who is your smartest senator? And he gave me a name. This is [DATE]. I said, Who is your dumbest Senator? [PERSON]. Who is [PERSON]? [PERSON]. Oh, I see, he is, really? Yeah, he is the dumbest senator. Well, now he is a lot dumber than it used to be, I can tell you. It is true. It is true. It is true. And you can take the gloves up because they do all this disinformation, they make up phony stuff. Like the military with what he said, I think it is a disgrace and he should apologize. A source said. I have [CARDINAL] people that said, no way, it did not happen. They said and the names are out there. So when they do that, you take the gloves off, that is all. Really dishonest people, dishonest people. No, it is a disgrace. And nobody's done for the military what I have done. We have totally rebuilt our military. We have made it stronger than ever. We have the greatest weapons in the world. We have gotten raises for our great warriors. Our vet just got a [PERCENT] approval rating, the highest in the history of the [ORG], our vets. They gave it a [CARDINAL], the [ORG], gave it a [PERCENT] approval rating. Nobody's done more, nobody. And we do. We have weapons, the likes of which nobody's ever seen before. Hope to God we do not have to use them but nobody has them. Not [GPE], not [GPE], nobody has the weaponry that we have. We have the greatest weapons in the world and hopefully do not have to use them. Just remember that, we have the I call it the super-duper missiles, like at a level that nobody's ever seen before. You do not see them either. They go through here, they say, Boy, what happened? What was that? It is gone. It is here. There it is. I hear a noise over there. Where is it? It is gone but it is over there. But it is a hydrosonic. I call it super-duper, because super-duper is easier for people to understand then hydrosonic. But we have the greatest [MONEY] we spent. The greatest weapons in the world. The greatest weapons that this world has ever seen without a question, I do not have to say what they are. In fact, the fake news said, He just gave away classified information. I said, No, I just said we have the greatest weapons. I did not tell you what they are. I could, because as president I am allowed to do it. I mean, [PERSON] is the one that gives her white classified information. Yeah, [PERSON]. And how about the idiot [PERSON]? I mean, he comes in and all he wants to do is go to war with everybody. If I listened to that idiot, we'd be right now in World War Five. Sir, we saw some movement in [GPE]. I think we should go to war with them. And I think [GPE], let us do them both at the same time. Let us also go in right now to [GPE]. Hey, do you remember [GPE]? We were supposed to be at war with [GPE]. What happened? What happened? You know what the press said? They said, it is amazing. First they said it was amazing and those people lost their job, probably. It is amazing what I have done, they said. No, we are supposed to be at war. They have a lot of nuclear stuff, it would not be easy. We'd win, we are going to win. Although, I tell you what I took over our military was totally depleted. We had a depleted mil-, we had old planes, we had old everything. It was a depleted military. And now it is a beautiful brand new we have F-35s that you cannot see. Stealth, they are stealth. We have all new rockets, all new missiles, brand new planes, the bombers, the tankers, the jet fighters. What we have done is incredible. And we had to do it, somebody had to do it. Somebody said, well, we are sort of doing some damage to our budget. I said, Look, I want to have a strong military. If I see some people, some soldiers from foreign lands, right, walking up or running up the [ORG] lawn, the beautiful south lawn of [FAC]. I am not going to be saying, We did not do too well with the military, but we kept it under control in the budget, right? No, the military supersedes everything. I do not know, to me, I have always heard [ORG]. But to me, the most important thing has always been the military, our defense and our offense if needed. You know, it is always [inaudible 00:35:36]. [PERSON] should not be asking for your support. He should be begging for your forgiveness and he should be. [PERSON] supported the disastrous [ORG]. This building would not be here if you ever did that one. Which would have been a death sentence for the [GPE] auto industry and other industries. He supported the horrendous [GPE] deal, okay. How about the [GPE] deal? It is a disaster. So that was a [PERSON] deal, I must say, not him. Although I guess he had he was vice, Hey, you know what is interesting with [PERSON]? So he always says, Why did not the president do this. And why did not the president do that? And why did not do this and that, and this and that. That is been there for [DATE], but he just left [DATE]. You know what I mean, he was there. And I keep saying, Why did not you do it? Why did not you do it? Could've done it. It is not like he was [DATE]. They were there [DATE]. Why did not you do it sleepy [PERSON]? But the [GPE] deal and I say it all the time. She said, This will create [CARDINAL], 000 jobs. And everybody got all excited, oh, those jobs. The problem was the jobs were all produced in [GPE], so that did not work out to well. [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] jobs for [GPE]. Anyway, I renegotiated the deal in its entirety, now it is a good deal. That was a rip, I will tell you. And the pro-China Paris Climate Accord, it is pro-everything, it is pro-everybody but us. That would have cost us [MONEY], and we would have had the privilege of closing down [ORG]'s probably [PERCENT] of your companies. You could have never, you could have never done it. It is an [NORP] deal. And you know when I did it, I thought I'd be scorned. People understood that it was a total rip off. They understood it. With every decision, [PERSON] twisted a knife into the hands and heart of the [NORP] worker. But these brutal betrayals ended [DATE] I took the oath of office, that is true. I mean, I saw so much stupidity, the endless wars and we are almost out of [GPE] as you know. Not easy to get out because we have people in this country, the military industrial complex. [PERSON] called it the military industrial complex, and it does exist. It is not easy- [inaudible [TIME]] industrial complex and it does exist. It is not easy to get out, but we are very close to getting out and getting out of the Middle East. We are down to very little in [GPE]. We are down to almost nothing in [GPE], but I will be honest with you, we kept the oil. Somebody said, You still have some soldiers in [GPE]? I said, That is why they kept the oil. We kept the oil. We should have done that in [GPE]. Remember I used to say a long time ago before I was, Do not go into the Middle East, but if you are going to go in and keep the oil. Well, we went in and we did not keep anything and all the death, the blood in the sand, I call it the blood in the sand, that worthless sand. All of that death that has been caused for no reason. It was the worst decision in the history of our country going into the Middle East. We are in there now [MONEY], we are almost out. [MONEY] and nothing but death and [CARDINAL] of lives if you look at both sides, I will look at both sides. Somebody would say, Oh, I should not be looking at the other side. I look at both sides/ a lot of innocent people were killed. We lost incredible soldiers. I see the coffins, the caskets come in in [GPE] and I see it. And I said, Oh boy, Why, why, why, why. Why did they do this? My first week, I withdrew from the transpacific partnership and saved that whole business of so much and what I had to do is I extended for a short time and then totally ended [ORG]. You know [ORG]'s the worst trade deal ever made? Ever made. And we did the [ORG], [GPE], [GPE]. We have a great deal. And the reason I know it is a great deal because the other sides are unhappy. You always liked to have an unhappy person at the other sides. No, they are okay. But they had a free rip at us for [DATE] and [DATE] and [DATE], [ORG]. How many buildings, how many factories did you lose right here? Where they moved over to [GPE], moved up to [GPE], moved all over the place, but that is not going to happen anymore. The new deal makes it very prohibitive to do that. In [DATE], I signed a historic executive order making it really something. You got to do a couple of little expressions it is called buy [NORP] and hire [NORP]. You know life is crazy in politics. [PERSON] runs for president like [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] times, right? And I used to call him [PERCENT] Joe. And that was primetime for him, right? Now that primetime is long over, he ends up winning the nomination. Explain that? But had if [PERSON] left and been loyal to her communist ideology, dare say socialist, but it is communist. It was pretty close. Maybe somewhere in-between heading toward the C-word. But had she left before Super Tuesday, [PERSON] would've lost every state, but she took the votes away from [PERSON]. And [PERSON] is a nice guy, you know Crazy [PERSON]. He is the nicest loser I have ever seen. When they talk about sportsmanship, he got screwed by [PERSON] badly, but not as badly as this time, this was worse. Because all [PERSON] had to do is leave [DATE] early. She did not even have to endorse him. And the votes that she got, which were not many, but far more than he needed, because he lost a couple of states by literally a small amount of votes. He would've gotten most of those votes. He would've won. He would have been the one we fought. I do not know/ who would have been better? Who would have been easier [PERSON] or [PERSON]? Tell me. [PERSON], who says [PERSON]? Who says [PERSON]? I do not know. It is hard. [PERSON] had more spirit. [PERSON]'s got no spirit, it is dead as a rock. The only spirit he is got is spirit to beat me. And that is called the negative spirit. And historically that does not do that well. If you look at old races when somebody's getting votes because they do not like somebody, you know there is an ideology that let us face it does not like me too much. Somebody said, We do not like his personality. I said, I always thought I had a good personality. They do not like my personality. Who the hell cares about my personality, right? Right? Got to get the job done. See those rough guys over there? I do not like their personality either, but they get the job done. Right? Who the hell cares? Who cares about their personality? But when [PERSON] was vice president and other countries flooded our market Thank you very much. Who is that? Wow. Good voice. Have you ever tried opera? Good voice. Thank you, darling. But other countries flooded our market with subsidized washing machines. You remember that disaster? Does anybody know about the [ORG] plant in [GPE], [GPE]? Right? And the head of [ORG] came to see me. I was president-elect and he called and I do not know, for some reason I have heard of [ORG] and I have heard of it all my life, I guess. I did not know much about it. They made washing machines and I never knew, I knew they were dumping steel on us and dumping certain things. But I did not know they were dumping washing machines. And he was a good guy, came up to my office and he said, They are putting us out of business, [GPE], [GPE], they are dumping washing machines. They make washing machines. They dump them into our market. They put everybody out of business. Then they charge you a lot of money when everyone's gone. Just like [PERSON] used to do, right? Just like other people do right now, unfortunately, but we are trying to track them down. And I said, That is really terrible. I do not know. Somehow it hit me. So we put a [PERCENT] tariff on all washing machines coming into our country. And I visited with [PERSON]. You know [PERSON]? You know he is a great wrestler. One of the best. He was a great, great wrestler. Really a phenomenal wrestler, a real champion, [ORG] champion and old [PERSON]. And that is the way he is. He is a tough guy. No games, right? No games. That he works with our guys here, your guys. And he was great, but it is [PERSON]'s area. And we went up and saw the plant and then making [CARDINAL] a day. I mean, they gave me a number, it cannot be positive. I think they said [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] 000 a day. I said, How the hell can you make that many washing machines? But you know what I am talking about Congressmen, right? They are making [CARDINAL] of washing machines a day and it is a vibrant company again, it was dead, it was going to close. But I evened up the score, I put the tariffs and now what they are doing is [ORG] and [ORG], and these companies that made the washing machine they are now coming into [GPE]. And in order to avoid the tariff, they are building plants in [GPE] and that is okay and that is what we should be doing. We are going to be doing it a lot more too. We are going to be doing it a lot more. [PERSON] allowed other countries to target our steel industries and it was like a disaster for our steel industry, but we took historic action to end these practices and place strong tariffs on foreign aluminum and steel. And it brought back our steel. Now steel plants are opening or being upgraded in [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and all across the Midwest. They were gonzo. And you know certain industries you need. Some industries you do not , but steel you need. Steel you need. For defense, you need it. You do not want to talk war. You do not want to talk about that, but if we had a problem, what are you going to do? Well, we do not have any steel mills. Let us see if we can get some steel from [GPE]. But sir, you are fighting them. Well, that is not working out too well. No, we had to save our steel. We had to save our aluminum industry and we have done it. We have done a great job, but you have a lot of steel mills going up right here in [GPE]. And a lot of them being expanded. And they are really state-of-the-art. As vice president, [PERSON] did nothing as [GPE] stole our intellectual property, flooded our markets with dumped goods. Unfairly subsidized these industries. Manipulated its currency. They are the greatest in the world at that. I go to my guys, they said, What about doing a little movement on the dollar? Sir, we cannot do that. It has to float naturally. Well, [GPE] does it. [GPE], you talk about a manipulation. Man, it is like a yo-yo. Let us see, let us raise it. Let us lower it, lets do this and that. But we actually called them on it, did not we Congressman? [PERSON], by the way, you did such a good job. You are a hell of a lawyer. You could represent me [DATE]. Actually he did. He actually did represent me. Right? [PERSON], what a group. They are tough. And then you had [PERSON] into it. They liked him though, do not they huh? They like [PERSON]. And they poisoned our communities with fentanyl. You know that? Instead, [PERSON] allowed [GPE] to ravage our towns, raid our factories and rip apart our communities. That is what they did. And then he goes in and he brings his son. Hey, see if you can give him some money. Give him [MONEY]. I went to [PERSON]. [PERSON] is like one of the biggest guys on Wall Street, [ORG]. I said, [PERSON], what are the chances. He does a lot of business with [GPE] said, [PERSON], what are the chances of somebody walking into an office in [GPE] and in [TIME], walking out with [CARDINAL] to manage? He said, [CARDINAL]. He said, I could not do it and I have this great company. It is a disgrace. How about where he points? Then he says, You are not getting [MONEY] unless you get rid of that damn prosecutor. And then they says, They got rid of the prosecutor. Here is your [MONEY]. Does anything happen? Nothing happens. I am so angry at [NORP]. I am. I am so angry. I am so angry, but a lot of things are happening. You are seeing, you are reading the papers also. A lot of things are happening. You know they spied on my campaign and we caught them. And by the way, that is [PERSON], that is [PERSON]. They spied on my campaign. It is never happened before. It is treason. [PERSON] and all the sleazebags, they spied on my campaign and we caught them. Let us now see what happened. I stay out of it. I just say, I am trying like hell to stay out of it. I do not have to actually, but it is better if I do. I think. [PERSON] is shaking his head sort of like that is the weakest yes, but it is true. Right? But it is true, I am trying to stay out of it. But it is a disgrace that it is taken this long. I tell you what, these people are bad people. They have done things. What they have done to General [PERSON] and to other people is a disgrace. It is a disgrace. And many others, but [PERSON] agenda is made in [GPE]. My agenda is made in the [GPE]. It is very simple. And I took the toughest ever action to stand up to [GPE] and their [DATE] of pillaging, plundering, looting, including these massive tariffs. Do not forget, I charged tariffs. Took in [MONEY]. They targeted our great farmers. Do we have any farmers here? Any farmers? Well, am I correct? We gave the farmers [MONEY]. Thank you very much, [GPE]. Right? Because they were targeted for [CARDINAL] over a [DATE] period, [DATE] and [CARDINAL]. Right? Did you get your check? And you might not be in business if I did not do that. Good? Good. Thank you, darling. She gave me the right answer. It is always dangerous to do that. No, I never got the money. No. She got the money. Yeah? But once again, [PERSON] has sided with [GPE] over [GPE]. Look, you think this guy's going to be tough in [GPE]? His son? No, no. Think of it. And then he takes ads. He is going to be tough on [GPE]. This guy, they looted him and [PERSON]. And in all fairness, not just [DATE], this has gone on for [DATE]. Probably the biggest reason I decided to run and give up [CARDINAL] of the greatest lives anyone's ever had for this, for this. But you know why I like it? Because we have done more in [DATE] than any administration in the history of the country. And I say that and these fake news people do not even question it. There is nobody done what we have done. Between our military, between our trade, between our energy independence. All of the things, we could go on forever. But [PERSON] vowed to remove those tariffs. He wants to remove the tariffs. You know when I made the deal with [GPE], I said I have to leave the tariffs on. They said, You got to be kidding. They wanted [CARDINAL] thing, the removal of the tariffs, and I would not do it. We would not do it. I said no. But [PERSON] said [DATE], he wants to take the He does not know what a tariff is first of all. Sleepy [PERSON] would like to remove the tariffs off [GPE]. They are paying [MONEY] a year. Could we take them off? Absolutely. What are they exactly? But it would not even happen that way. The radical left, which likes [GPE], the radical left would walk into his office. And here is your bill, right? It was supposed to be a speech. I have not exactly used it too much [DATE]. And they will say, Here President, sign this. Oh, okay. Do you have a pen? Okay. What was that? That is the deal with [GPE]. Do not worry about it. That is what would happen. But he gave [GPE] free rein to continue ransacking the American Heartland. And you know, look, they were targeting you. The reason nobody took on [GPE] was [GPE] said, We are going to go after your heartland. And they said that to the presidents. And I said, Go ahead, do it. And the farmers were the most loyal. They all said, We have got to do it sometime. They told me that. I mean, they told me that loud and clear. We did not lose anything with the farmers. They said, Somebody's got to do it. And I said, Here is what we are going to do. We are going to let them target you. They are going to stop buying. We are going to charge them tariffs and going to give you back the money that you lost, that you were targeted for. And we are going to have [MONEY] leftover for the treasury. That is exactly what happened. Nobody else ever told him that. [PERSON] is weak. He is too scared to stand up to the radical left of his own party. And he is terrified of standing up to [GPE], but I believe he is much more scared of the radical left than he is of [GPE]. That is why [GPE] is desperate. You see the reports and news reports. They want [PERSON] to win. They want [PERSON] to win. They want him to win at any cost. If [PERSON] is elected, [GPE] will own [GPE]. And if [PERSON] is elected, you will have a depression the likes of which this country has never seen before. It is very simple. It is very simple. Largest tax increase ever proposed. That is what they are going to have. Does anybody mind paying more tax? All my life I have studied. I like politics. I just always liked it. It is lucky I liked it because I never did it before. They said, He cannot run. He is got no experience. And now that I look around [DATE], I was in [FAC], I said, Oh, excuse me. Is this [FAC]? No, but a lot of it is common sense. It is all common sense. That is why we call it protest. We are studying some of the things. I will tell you [CARDINAL] quick story. So we are building an aircraft carrier long before my term, the Gerald Ford. And they decide on the catapults. You know the catapult? That throws the plane into the air. For [DATE], it is been [DATE], whatever longer, it is been steam, simple, beautiful steam throws her off You ever see those airplanes? They go off. They catapult. So I noticed that this ship is never getting done. I came in and they said, Oh, it is got tremendous cost overruns. I said, What is the problem? Well, the catapult system does not work. That is strange because they have been building them for [DATE]. I wonder why. You know about this. And I said, Strange, let me check. So anyway, I am supposed to go over and take a tour. I went to take a tour of the ship, find out why it is so late. I will not tell you how many [MONEY] it is over budget. [MONEY]. But I heard the catapult system and the elevators are no good. Other than that, it is wonderful. Right? The elevators that bring the planes up, they do not work. So if you have a problem, you can get your plans up. They are down stuck in a garage, down at the bottom. Not too good. So I go over and they want me to meet the admiral, but I said, No, no, no. I do not want to meet the admiral yet. I meet with the admirals a lot. I got a lot of admirals. I like the admirals. I want to meet with the catapultors. Sir, why would you want to meet with the catapultors for? I want to find out why the hell the catapults do not work. So I went there and you know they did a new system. It is electric, it is all electric. So instead of steam, which is simple and great and powerful and good. And they know how it works for [DATE] and [DATE], they decided to go all electric. Now if you take a little glass of water, take this glass of water, you throw it and that is the end of that. You bring somebody in from [ORG], how the hell do you fix it? And we are dealing with the ocean and rockets being shot at the ship and the rough stuff. Right? But it was not working. So I said, No, I want to meet with a catapultor. So there were [CARDINAL] people that came in. One's been doing it for [DATE] I think he said. I said, Who is the boss? I am, sir. I said, What do you think of our new system of electric catapults? Sir, it is no good, sir. I said, That is not good. That is actually it is what I expected it to be on. I said, So, it is no good. Right? The system is no good? No, sir. I said, What do you think of steam? Sir, it is the greatest. That if it breaks down, I can fix it with a blowtorch or this hammer, I can fix it. And if the waves hit it, sir, all it does is cool it down a little bit, sir. It is actually good for it, good for the surrounding steel. I said, So you think it is better? Surrounding steel. I said, So you think it is better? I said, Why did they do the electric? Because they are totally inexperienced. Then I wanted to see the architect and I saw a representative, the architect of ship. Now this is a ship that costs [MONEY]. And I looked at the architect. I said, Have you designed a ship before? And he said, Yeah, I have. I said, You know, they have a [MONEY] cost overrun for electric catapults, and they are no good even if they were. I said to the guy, Why is it that they did away? Sir, we could do it much faster. The thing goes back and forth. I said, All right, well, that makes sense. But the catapulter said, But sir, it does not matter because it takes [TIME], if you are [PERSON] team, to get a plane hooked in. So the steam generates during [TIME] and it is all set to go. It does not help that it keeps going back and forth. I said, That makes sense. That makes sense. So it is [MONEY] in cost overruns and here is the story. They spent much more money and it is no good. Then they have the elevators. Now, tractors use hydraulic, right? You know, they could do anything. Lift up. They go. It can rain. It can snow. Lightning hits the damn thing and nothing happens. The lightning gets hurt. Nothing happens. So they have these big elevators that lift the planes up. You know, the sirens go off. Everything's beautiful. The problem is the elevators do not work. So they are magnetized. They are lifted by magnets. I said, Who the hell ever heard? I know about that. You know, it is a new technology that is [DATE] off. So instead of using powerful hydraulic that never breaks, they have magnetized elevators. So stupid. I mean, honestly, so stupid. I tell you this because you are workers and you guys understand this. It is what we do is so stupid. So they have [MONEY] in cost overrun for stuff that is no good. And [DATE] I told them it is no good. You might as well rip it out because it is never going to work. You put hydraulic in the elevators and you go back to steam and it is such a shame to see the kind of money that was squandered by people that have no idea what the hell they are doing. It is a shame. Yeah. It is a shame. And you would understand that. I'd only tell that story to really sort of a group like this because you guys understand it. It is mechanical engineering at a very easy level. It is easy to understand. [MONEY] wasted for something not as good. For [DATE]. Our politicians spent [MONEY] rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign Wars, and defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities. We are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the [GPE] where they belong. When the terrible plague arrived from [GPE], we mobilized [NORP] industry like never before. We rapidly developed lifesaving therapies reducing the fatality rate by [PERCENT]. We have done such a good job, except in terms of public relations because the press just will not accept that. Think of what we have done with the ventilators. Soon, soon, the vaccines and the therapeutics, Remdesivir and other things. Europe is [PERCENT] greater excess mortality than [GPE]. They do not want to say it. And now, as you know, you heard [DATE], Europe had a tremendous outbreak. Okay. You know, they say, Well, Europe, Europe, Europe. No, we are doing great. We are doing great. Sadly, very sadly, I hate it, but they had a big outbreak that caused a stir in the market [DATE]. We launched the most ambitious vaccine program ever created. And we will deliver a vaccine before [DATE], but it could be a lot sooner than that, a lot sooner. You know, it is interesting. The [NORP], they are all saying, We want a vaccine. That is when they thought we could not get it, right? Because if we relied on them, this vaccine would have taken [DATE] more because of the [ORG], and I have mobilized the [ORG], and it is incredible. But it would have taken [DATE] more. So when they heard that we were getting the vaccine, they started knocking it. Think of it. So they put politics over life and death. I mean, it is incredible. By the way, we are rounding the corner in any event, but we are going to have a vaccine very soon, is a great vaccine, great, great vaccine. It is looking really good, really good. And it is going to be a lot sooner than anyone thought. And it is pretty sad when the [NORP] try and make that into a political issue. Because they are unhappy. It is coming too soon. They did not think that would happen. We will end this pandemic in [DATE]. Will be [CARDINAL] of [DATE] of the history of our country. That is what is happening. [DATE] will end just before [DATE]. You will see numbers, the likes of which no country has ever seen. That is how well we are doing. You will see. And if it is before, so, they are not good. I guess you are going to have to remember that. And if they are good, I hope you are going to remember it too, but they are going to be great. Somebody predicted [PERCENT] and then somebody said [PERCENT] GDP increase. Nobody's ever heard of a number like that. But that is the kind of thing we are doing. Under my leadership, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world, and now we are doing it again. In [DATE], we have added a record smashing [CARDINAL] jobs, never been close to that. [DATE], [CARDINAL] jobs. Manufacturing production is up [PERCENT]. auto production has surged [PERCENT]. And retail sales have soared [PERCENT]. But if sleepy [PERSON] wins, the economy will collapse. It is going to collapse. Even psychologically it'll collapse. And you know, as good as the stock market's doing, it is a headwind knowing you have an election. Things happen in elections, some bad things, some stupid things. But that is a headwind. We'd be doing even better if this election were over. If we win and when we win the election, you are going to see things roar because that is what people want. That is what the market wants. And that is what the workers want. [PERSON] keeps talking about a nationwide shutdown. There is no shutdown. My plan is to crush the virus. [PERSON] plan and [PERSON]'s really plan is to, and it is not that he wants to crush [GPE], but he will just out of gross incompetence. [PERSON] will surrender to the virus, just like he surrendered to [GPE]. And just like he surrendered to the radical left, including his own running mate who is running the show. And she is nothing special. She is nothing. Between her and [PERSON], what a couple of great ones. What a couple of, what some people? Well, I will tell you something. [PERSON] did do a great number on [ORG]. Did not she? I tell you. [CARDINAL] question and that was the end of him. How you enjoying politics, [PERSON]? That did not work out too well. [MONEY] wiped out in [CARDINAL] question. That was the most expensive question in history. To protect our workers during the pandemic, I suspended the entry of new foreign workers who threatened [NORP] jobs. I know you do not mind. You do not mind that, do you folks? As the economy reopens, I want to ensure [NORP] workers that we are putting [GPE] first and our jobs are put first. Our country is put first. Our manufacturing is put first. Everything is now put first for the [GPE]. And by the way, we are up to mile [CARDINAL] on the wall. We are setting records on not allowing all of these. I mean, some really bad. When you look at the traffickers. They traffic in women and drugs and other things, but they traffic in women, the drug dealers always. Setting records now on the wall because we have [QUANTITY]. We are averaging [QUANTITY] a week and we will be finished with the wall very soon. And it is had a huge impact. So [CARDINAL] of the most radical things that will happen, and there is no way he can get away with this because he was banning fracking for [DATE]. He is running, running, he is banning fracking. I said, He is gone. He is gone. And then all of a sudden, now all of sudden he said, Well, I did not really say that. He did. Remember, it is always the first thing they say with a politician. It is the first thing. He wants to ban fracking and outlaw [GPE] energy production. And you are a big energy producer, whether you know it or not. So he is going to ban fracking. There is no question about it. And even if he did not want to, the whole radical left, their plan is to ban fracking. They want to ban fracking. They do not want any fossil fuels. [DATE], [PERSON] reiterated his plan to require net [CARDINAL] carbon emissions. So you do that. I think it is wonderful. Close up [PERCENT] of your plants. This requirement would end all investment in fracking and it would just shut down everything. Our country, do you see the rolling blackouts they have in [GPE]? I do not think we want too many of them in [GPE]. Do we? Would anybody like a few rolling blackouts? Like we'd like to watch president [PERSON] [TIME]. I am sorry, darling, but we have no energy. We have no energy. We are going to get it from the wind. The wind is blowing. The wind, the wind has got a wonderful, wonderful energy. The wind, when it is blowing it is just fine for [PERCENT] of the time. By ending fracking, [PERSON] would destroy [CARDINAL] [GPE] jobs and your energy prices would go through the roof. When [PERSON] was Vice President, they deliberately killed [PERCENT] of all coal mining jobs and the rest were coming fast. I saved it. I put our miners back to work, clean coal. I call it clean coal. Can do a lot with coal. And while I am President, [GPE] will remain the number [CARDINAL] producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world and [GPE] workers will continue leading the way. And that is what we are doing. And just in concluding, over [DATE], we will build [GPE] into the manufacturing, super power of the world. And we will end our reliance on [GPE] and all other faraway lands that nobody in this beautiful facility, whatever the hell you make here, I do not know, but it looks good to me. But nobody ever heard of it. You have lands that would go to that nobody ever even heard of. Where are you sending this money? We are sending it to such and such a country. I never heard of it. We will make our medical supplies right here in [GPE]. We will cut your taxes and taxes for middle class families at a level never seen before. You know, we gave you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. We gave you the biggest regulation cut in the history of our country. And we are going to give you additional regulation cuts. That is one of the reasons you had the jobs. You know, in many ways, the regulation cutting was perhaps as important or more important. You see the tax cutting easier, but the regulation cutting was every bit as important. And we are going to expand opportunity zones to ensure that no community is left behind. And they have been a tremendous success, especially for the [NORP], [NORP] community. We are doing incredible. [PERSON], great Senator from [GPE]. We worked hard on it. Opportunities zones. It is a big success. We will enforce immigration rules that defend [NORP] families, raise [NORP] wages, and always put the interests of [NORP] workers first. We will enact fair trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the [GPE], right? And we will always live by the timeless words of our national motto: In God We trust. And they took the word God out of the Pledge of Allegiance. You saw that. I was listening to this Pledge of Allegiance and I said, That is strange. They must've made a mistake. It must've been a typo. Something happened. But then it happened twice. And then it was getting ready to happen a third time, and somebody heard that the public was enraged, including me by the way. And by the way, we want the [ORG] to stand and put their hand on their heart. Got to do it. Right? I thought we taught them that lesson [DATE]. The commissioner tried it again. It is not working too well. Not working. The ratings are not good. People are angry about it. People love our country. You love our country. You love our flag. You love our anthem. [DATE], if you want jobs, if you want opportunity, if you want safety, and if you want a President who defends the dreams of workers in [GPE] and [GPE] and all across [GPE] in [GPE], then you need to get out and vote for [PERSON], [PERSON]. How good is [PERSON]? [PERSON]. And I love [PERSON], but it is not [PERSON], okay? You understand? It is not [PERSON]. [PERSON] will be the first one to say. You know, when he said that [DATE]. He said the [PERSON] [PERSON] administration. I said, That is strange. And [PERSON] called me up. He said, You never have to do that. I said, Do not worry, [PERSON]. I will not . I promise. [PERSON] has done a great job. I will tell you. He is a great guy. Together we will make [GPE] safer. We will make [GPE] stronger and prouder and greater than ever before. We are going to make it greater than ever before. And again, this was not a rally. This was a group of people, workers, and this is what it was told to me as, and we had a lot of fun and we have a lot of fun, but it is very serious business. [DATE] and before, depending on whether or not you have those fake ballots or whatever. Be careful with that. I mean, that thing is going to be one of the great catastrophes. What a mess. And they want it to be a mess. They know it is no good. I think it is [CARDINAL] different races. When they have small races, they cannot account. People steal the ballots. People do not get the ballots. They do not send them to a [NORP] area or maybe a [NORP] area, whatever, it is still wrong. But it happens to be [NORP], unfortunately. But they do not send them out. Then they harvest them, which they are not allowed to do. They have in [GPE], the Governor said he signed an order that they do not have to sign. We need no signature verification. Oh, that is great. Because they could not get people to sign, so they said, We will just send them in. Do not worry about it. This is a real affront to our democracy. This is a horrible thing that is going on. And the [NORP] know it and they say, Well, he is not for our great heritage. He is fighting our vote. No I am not fighting our vote. You have ballots that you go out and you can get, you could request as you know, you can request them and that is fine. But if you are not requesting them, when you get [CARDINAL] of ballots, [CARDINAL] they say all over [GPE], where the hell are they going? Who is sending them? Who is getting them? Who is sending them back? What is happening with the transportation? Who is guarding the lockboxes? They know it is a fraud waiting to happen. But you know, we are not talking about [PERCENT], which is no good, because you could lose or win an election by [PERCENT], we are talking about [PERCENT], [PERCENT] in [CARDINAL] case, [PERCENT]. This is a disgrace that they are allowed to get away with. And what they want to do is they want to have a mess at [TIME] on [DATE] and then fight it out in the courts. And the [NORP] should be ashamed of themselves because they know what they are causing. We love [GPE]. We love [GPE]. God bless you. God bless [GPE]. And God bless [GPE]. Thank you.

{"id": "nprorg20210210966396848readtrumpsjan6speechakeypartofimpeachmenttrial", "text": "Well, thank you very much. This is incredible. Media will not show the magnitude of this crowd. Even I, when I turned on [DATE], I looked, and I saw [CARDINAL] of people here. But you do not see [CARDINAL] of people behind you because they do not want to show that. We have [CARDINAL] of people here and I just want them to be recognized by the fake news media. Turn your cameras please and show what is really happening out here because these people are not going to take it any longer. They are not going to take it any longer. Go ahead. Turn your cameras, please. Would you show? They came from all over the world, actually, but they came from all over our country. I just really want to see what they do. I just want to see how they covered. I have never seen anything like it. But it would be really great if we could be covered fairly by the media. The media is the biggest problem we have as far as I am concerned, single biggest problem. The fake news and the Big tech. Big tech is now coming into their own. We beat them [DATE]. We surprised them. We took them by surprise and [DATE] they rigged an election. They rigged it like they have never rigged an election before. And by the way, [TIME] they did not do a bad job either if you notice. I am honest. And I just, again, I want to thank you. It is just a great honor to have this kind of crowd and to be before you and [CARDINAL] of [NORP] patriots who are committed to the honesty of our elections and the integrity of our glorious republic. All of us here [DATE] do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical-left [NORP], which is what they are doing. And stolen by the fake news media. That is what they have done and what they are doing. We will never give up, we will never concede. It does not happen. You do not concede when there is theft involved. Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore and that is what this is all about. And to use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with: We will stop the steal. [DATE] I will lay out just some of the evidence proving that we won this election and we won it by a landslide. This was not a close election. You know, I say, sometimes jokingly, but there is no joke about it: I have been in [CARDINAL] elections. I won them both and the second one, I won much bigger than the first. OK. [CARDINAL] people voted for our campaign, the most of any incumbent president by far in the history of our country, [CARDINAL] more people than [DATE]. And I was told by the real pollsters - we do have real pollsters - they know that we were going to do well and we were going to win. What I was told, if I went from [CARDINAL], which we had [DATE], to [CARDINAL], there was no chance of losing. Well, we did not go to [CARDINAL], we went to [CARDINAL], and they say we lost. We did not lose. And by the way, does anybody believe that [PERSON] had [CARDINAL] votes? Does anybody believe that? He had [CARDINAL] computer votes. It is a disgrace. There is never been anything like that. You could take third-world countries. Just take a look. Take third-world countries. Their elections are more honest than what we have been going through in this country. It is a disgrace. It is a disgrace. Even when you look at [TIME]. They are all running around like chickens with their heads cut off with boxes. Nobody knows what the hell is going on. There is never been anything like this. We will not let them silence your voices. We are not going to let it happen, I am not going to let it happen. Thank you. And I'd love to have if [CARDINAL] of people would be allowed. The military, the secret service. And we want to thank you and the police law enforcement. Great. You are doing a great job. But I'd love it if they could be allowed to come up here with us. Is that possible? Can you just let him come up, please? And [PERSON], you did a great job. He is got guts. You know what? He is got guts, unlike a lot of people in [ORG]. He is got guts. He fights, he fights. And I will tell you. Thank you very much, [PERSON]. Fantastic job. I watched. That is a tough act to follow, those [CARDINAL]. [PERSON] is one of the most brilliant lawyers in the country, and he looked at this and he said, What an absolute disgrace that this can be happening to our Constitution. And he looked at [PERSON], and I hope [PERSON] is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so. Because if [PERSON] does the right thing, we win the election. All he has to do, all this is, this is from the number [CARDINAL], or certainly [CARDINAL] of the top, Constitutional lawyers in our country. He has the absolute right to do it. We are supposed to protect our country, support our country, support our Constitution, and protect our constitution. States want to revote. The states got defrauded. They were given false information. They voted on it. Now they want to recertify. They want it back. All Vice President [PERSON] has to do is send it back to the states to recertify and we become president and you are the happiest people. And I actually, I just spoke to [PERSON]. I said: [PERSON], that does not take courage. What takes courage is to do nothing. That takes courage. And then we are stuck with a president who lost the election by a lot and we have to live with that for [DATE]. We are just not going to let that happen. Many of you have traveled from all across the nation to be here, and I want to thank you for the extraordinary love. That is what it is. There is never been a movement like this, ever, ever. For the extraordinary love for this amazing country, and this amazing movement, thank you. By the way, this goes all the way back past [FAC]. You believe this? Look at this. That is. Unfortunately gave, they gave the press the prime seats. I cannot stand that. No. But you look at that behind. I wish they'd flip those cameras and look behind you. That is the most amazing sight. When they make a mistake, you get to see it on television. Amazing. Amazing. All the way back. And do not worry, we will not take the name off [FAC]. We will not cancel culture. You know they wanted to get rid of [FAC]. Either take it down or just put somebody else in there. I do not think that is going to happen. It damn well better not. Although, with this administration, if this happens, it could happen. You will see some really bad things happen. They will knock out [PERSON] too, by the way. They have been taking his statue down. But then we signed a little law. You hurt our monuments, you hurt our heroes, you go to jail for [DATE], and everything stopped. You notice that? It stopped. It all stopped. And they could use [PERSON] back in [GPE]. [PERSON]. They could use you. Your city's going to hell. They want [PERSON] back in [GPE]. We will get a little younger version of [PERSON]. Is that OK, [PERSON]? We are gathered together in the heart of our nation's capital for one very, very basic and simple reason: To save our democracy. You know most candidates on [TIME] and, of course, this thing goes on so long. They still do not have any idea what the votes are. We still have congressional seats under review. They have no idea. They have totally lost control. They have used the pandemic as a way of defrauding the people in a proper election. But you know, you know, when you see this and when you see what is happening. Number [CARDINAL], they all say, Sir, we will never let it happen again. I said, That is good. But what about [DATE]? You know they try and get you to go. They said, Sir, in [DATE], you are guaranteed. I said: I am not interested right now. Do me a favor, go back [DATE]. I want to go back [DATE]. Let us go back [DATE]. We want to go back and we want to get this right because we are going to have somebody in there that should not be in there and our country will be destroyed and we are not going to stand for that. For [DATE], [NORP] have gotten away with election fraud and weak [NORP]. And that is what they are. There is so many weak [NORP]. And we have great ones. [PERSON] and some of these guys, they are out there fighting. The [ORG] guys are fighting. But it is , it is incredible. Many of the [NORP], I helped them get in, I helped them get elected. I helped [PERSON] get elected. I helped. I could name [CARDINAL] of them, let us say, I will not bore you with it. And then all of a sudden you have something like this. It is like, Oh gee, maybe I will talk to the president sometime later. No, it is amazing. They are weak [NORP], they are pathetic [NORP] and that is what happens. If this happened to the [NORP], there'd be hell all over the country going on. There'd be hell all over the country. But just remember this: You are stronger, you are smarter, you have got more going than anybody. And they try and demean everybody having to do with us. And you are the real people, you are the people that built this nation. You are not the people that tore down our nation. The weak [NORP], and that is it. I really believe it. I think I am going to use the term, the weak [NORP]. You have got a lot of them. And you got a lot of great ones. But you got a lot of weak ones. They have turned a blind eye, even as [NORP] enacted policies that chipped away our jobs, weakened our military, threw open our borders and put [GPE] last. Did you see [DATE] where [PERSON] said, I want to get rid of the [GPE] First policy? What is that all about? Get rid of. How do you say I want to get rid of [ORG]? Even if you are going to do it, do not talk about it, right? Unbelievable what we have to go through. What we have to go through. And you have to get your people to fight. And if they do not fight, we have to primary the hell out of the ones that do not fight. You primary them. We are going to. We are going to let you know who they are. I can already tell you, frankly. But [DATE], using the pretext of the [GPE] virus and the scam of mail-in ballots, [NORP] attempted the most brazen and outrageous election theft and there is never been anything like this. So pure theft in [NORP] history. Everybody knows it. That election, our election was over at [TIME]. We are leading [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], by [CARDINAL] of votes. And then [TIME], or [TIME], boom, these explosions of bull****. And all of a sudden. All of a sudden it started to happen. Do not forget when [PERSON] got beat. [PERSON], hey. Did you see his? I wonder if he enjoyed his flight in [TIME]. But when [PERSON] got beaten, you know, he stands up like you are more typical, Well, I'd like to congratulate the victor. The victor? Who is the victor, [PERSON]? I'd like to congratulate. They do not go and look at the facts. No, I do not know. He got, he got slaughtered. Probably, maybe it was OK, maybe it was. But that is what happened. But we look at the facts and our election was so corrupt that in the history of this country we have never seen anything like it. You can go all the way back. You know, [GPE] is blessed with elections. All over the world they talk about our elections. You know what the world says about us now? They said, we do not have free and fair elections. And you know what else? We do not have a free and fair press. Our media is not free, it is not fair. It suppresses thought, it suppresses speech and it is become the enemy of the people. It is become the enemy of the people. It is the biggest problem we have in this country. No third-world countries would even attempt to do what we caught them doing. And you will hear about that in [TIME]. [NORP] are, [NORP] are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back. It is like a boxer. And we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. And we are going to have to fight much harder. And [PERSON] is going to have to come through for us, and if he does not , that will be a, a sad day for our country because you are sworn to uphold our Constitution. Now, it is up to [ORG] to confront this egregious assault on our democracy. And after this, we are going to walk down, and I will be there with you, we are going to walk down, we are going to walk down. Anyone you want, but I think right here, we are going to walk down to the [FAC], and we are going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we are probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them. Because you will never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that [ORG] do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated. I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the [FAC] building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard. [DATE] we will see whether [NORP] stand strong for integrity of our elections. But whether or not they stand strong for our country, our country. Our country has been under siege for a long time. Far longer than this [DATE] period. We have set it on a much greater course. So much, and we, I thought, you know, [DATE]. I thought it would be easy. We have created the greatest economy in history. We rebuilt our military. We get you the biggest tax cuts in history. Right? We got you the biggest regulation cuts. There is no president, whether it is [DATE], [DATE] or in [CARDINAL] case more, got anywhere near the regulation cuts. Used to take [DATE] to get a highway approved, now we are down to [CARDINAL]. I want to get it down to [CARDINAL], but we are down to [CARDINAL]. And it may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons, but we got it down to safety. We created [ORG], We, we, we. Look at what we did. Our military has been totally rebuilt. So we create [ORG] which, by and of itself, is a major achievement for an administration. And with us it is one of so many different things. Right to Try. Everybody know about Right to Try. We did things that nobody ever thought possible. We took care of our vets, our vets. The [ORG] now has the highest rating, [PERCENT]. The highest rating that it is had from the beginning, [PERCENT] approval rating. Always, you watch the [ORG], it was on television [TIME], people living in a horrible, horrible manner. We got that done. We got accountability done. We got it so that now in the [ORG], you do not have to wait for [DATE] [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] to see a doctor. If you cannot get a doctor, you go outside, you get the doctor. You have it taken care of and we pay the doctor. And we have not only made life wonderful for so many people, we have saved tremendous amounts of money, far secondarily, but we have saved a lot of money. And now we have the right to fire bad people in the [ORG]. We had [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] people that treated our veterans horribly. In primetime, they would not have treated our veterans badly. But they treated our veterans horribly. And we have what is called the account, [ORG]. And the accountability says if we see somebody in there that does not treat our vets well or they steal, they rob, they do things badly, we say: [PERSON] you are fired. Get out of here. Before you could not do that. You could not do that before. So we have taken care of things, we have done things like nobody's ever thought possible. And that is part of the reason that many people do not like us, because we have done too much. But we have done it quickly and we were going to sit home and watch a big victory and everybody had us down for a victory. It was going to be great and now we are out here fighting. I said to somebody, I was going to take [DATE] and relax after our big electoral victory. [TIME] it was over. But I was going to take [DATE]. And I can say this. Since our election, I believe, which was such a catastrophe, when I watch. And even these guys knew what happened. They know what happened. They are saying: Wow, [GPE]'s insurmountable. Wow, [GPE]. Look at the big leads we had, right. Even though the press said we would lose [GPE] by [CARDINAL] points. Even though the press said, [GPE]'s going to be close, we set a record; [GPE]'s going to be close, we set a record; [GPE] is going to be close, [GPE] is going to be close, we set a record. And we set a record with [NORP], with the [NORP] community, we set a record with everybody. [DATE] we see a very important event though. Because right over there, right there, we see the event going to take place. And I am going to be watching. Because history is going to be made. We are going to see whether or not we have great and courageous leaders, or whether or not we have leaders that should be ashamed of themselves throughout history, throughout eternity they will be ashamed. And you know what? If they do the wrong thing, we should never, ever forget that they did. Never forget. We should never ever forget. With [CARDINAL] of the [CARDINAL] states in question, we win the presidency of [GPE]. And by the way, it is much more important [DATE] than it was [TIME], because I do not . I spoke to [PERSON], what a great person, and [PERSON], [CARDINAL] great people, but it was a setup. And you know, I said, We have no backline anymore. The only backline, the only line of demarcation, the only line that we have is the veto of the president of [GPE]. So this is now, what we are doing, a far more important election than it was [DATE]. I want to thank the [CARDINAL] members of the [ORG]. Those are warriors. They are over there working like you have never seen before. Studying, talking, actually going all the way back, studying the roots of the Constitution, because they know we have the right to send a bad vote that was illegally gotten. They gave these people bad things to vote for and they voted because what did they know? And then when they found out [DATE], again, it took them [DATE] to devise this screen. And the only unhappy person in [GPE], single most unhappy, is [PERSON]. Because she said: Why did not you do this for me [DATE]? Why did not you do this for me [DATE]? Change the votes, [CARDINAL] 000 in [GPE]. You could have changed the whole thing. But she is not too happy. You know, you do not see her anymore. What happened? Where is [PERSON]? Where is she? But I want to thank all of those congressmen and women. I also want to thank our [CARDINAL], most courageous members of [ORG]. Senator [PERSON], Senator [PERSON], Senator [PERSON], [PERSON]. And [PERSON], I will tell you, she has been, she is been so great. She worked so hard. So let us give her and [PERSON] a little special hand because it was rigged against them. Let us give her and [PERSON]. [PERSON], [PERSON]. They fought a good race. They never had a shot. That equipment should never have been allowed to be used, and I was telling these people do not let him use this stuff. [PERSON], terrific person. [PERSON], [GPE]. [PERSON], great guy. [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], the coach, and [PERSON]. We want to thank them. Senators that stepped up, we want to thank them. I actually think though, it takes, again, more courage not to step up, and I think a lot of those people are going to find that out and you better start looking at your leadership, because your leadership has led you down the tubes. You know, we do not want to give $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] to people. We want to give them $[MONEY]. Oh, great. How does that play politically? Pretty good? And this has nothing to do with politics, but how does it play politically? [GPE] destroyed these people. We did not destroy. [GPE] destroy them, totally destroyed them. We want to give them $[MONEY] and they just would not change. I said give them $[MONEY], 000, we will pay it back. We will pay it back fast. You already owe [CARDINAL], give them [MONEY]. Let them live. Give them [MONEY]. And some of the people here disagree with me on that, but I just say, Look, you have got to let people live. And how does that play though? OK. Number one, it is the right thing to do. But how does that play politically? I think it is the primary reason, [CARDINAL] of the primary reasons, the other was just pure cheating. That was the primary, super primary reason. But you cannot do that, you got to use your head. As you know, the media has constantly asserted the outrageous lie that there was no evidence of widespread fraud. Have you ever seen these people? While there is no evidence of fraud. Oh, really? Well, I am going to read you pages. I hope you do not get bored listening to it. Promise? Do not get bored listening to it, all those [CARDINAL] of people back there. Move them up, please, yeah. All they, all these people, do not get bored, do not get angry at me because you are going to get bored because it is so much. The [NORP] people do not believe the corrupt, fake news anymore. They have ruined their reputation. But you know, it used to be that they'd argue with me. I'd fight. So I'd fight, they'd fight, I'd fight, they'd fight. Pop pop. You'd believe me, you'd believe them. Somebody comes out. You know, they had their point of view, I had my point of view, but you'd have an argument. Now what they do is they go silent. It is called suppression and that is what happens in a [NORP] country. That is what they do, they suppress. You do not fight with them anymore. Unless it is a bad story. They have a little bad story about me, they make it [CARDINAL] times worse and it is a major headline. But [PERSON], they do not talk about him. What happened to [PERSON]? Where is [PERSON]? Where is [PERSON]? They do not talk about him. They will watch, all the sets will go off. Well, they cannot do that because they get good ratings. Their ratings are too good. Now, where is [PERSON]? You know. And how come [PERSON] is allowed to give [MONEY] of money to get rid of the prosecutor in [GPE]? How does that happen? I'd ask you that question. How does that happen? Can you imagine if I said that? If I said that it would be a whole different ballgame. And how come [PERSON] gets [MONEY] from the mayor of [GPE]'s wife, and gets [MONEY] to sit on an energy board, even though he admits he has no knowledge of energy? And [MONEY] up front. And how come they go into [GPE] and they leave with [MONEY] to manage. Have you managed money before? No, I have not . Oh, that is good. Here is [CARDINAL]. No, they do not talk about that. No, we have a corrupt media. They have gone silent. They have gone dead. I now realize how good it was if you go back [DATE], I realized how good, even though I did not necessarily love them, I realized how good. It was like a cleansing motion, right? But we do not have that anymore. We do not have a fair media anymore. It is suppression. And you have to be very careful with that and they have lost all credibility in this country. We will not be intimidated into accepting the hoaxes and the lies that we have been forced to believe. Over [DATE], we have amassed overwhelming evidence about a fake election. This is the presidential election. [TIME] was a little bit better because of the fact that we had a lot of eyes watching [CARDINAL] specific state, but they cheated like hell anyway. You have [CARDINAL] of the dumbest governors in [GPE]. And you know when I endorsed him, and I did not know this guy, at the request of [PERSON], he said, Friend of mine's running for governor. What is his name? And you know the rest. He was in fourth place, fifth place. I do not know, he was, he was doing poorly. I endorse him, he went like a rocket ship and he won. And then I had to beat [PERSON] with this guy, [PERSON]. I had to beat [PERSON]. And I had to beat [PERSON], used to be a friend of mine. You know, I was on her last show, her [DATE], she picked the [CARDINAL] outstanding people. I do not think she thinks that any more. Once I ran for president, I did not notice there were too many calls coming in from [PERSON]. Believe it or not, she used to like me. But I was [CARDINAL] of the [CARDINAL] outstanding people. And I had a campaign against [PERSON] and [PERSON], against [PERSON]. And I had [PERSON], who weighs [QUANTITY]. He said he played offensive line in football. I am trying to figure that out. I am still trying to figure that out. He said that [TIME], I was an offensive lineman. I am saying: Really? That must have been a very small team. But I look at that and I look at what is happened and he turned out to be a disaster. This stuff happens. You know, look, I am not happy with [ORG]. They love to rule against me. I picked [CARDINAL] people. I fought like hell for them. [CARDINAL] in particular, I fought. They all said, Sir, cut him loose. He is killing the senators. You know, very loyal senators, they are very loyal people, Sir, cut him loose, he is killing us, sir, cut him loose. I must have gotten [CARDINAL] of the senators. I said: No, I cannot do that, it is unfair to him and it is unfair to the family. He did not do anything wrong. They made up stories, they are all made-up stories. He did not do anything wrong. Cut him loose, sir. I said, No, I will not do that. We got him through. And you know what, they could not give a damn. They could not give a damn. Let him rule the right way. But it almost seems that they are all going out of their way to hurt all of us and to hurt our country. To hurt our country. You know, I read a story in one of the newspapers recently how I control the [CARDINAL] [ORG] justices. I control them. They are puppets. I read it about [PERSON], that he is my personal attorney. That he will do anything for me. And I said, You know, it really is genius. Because what they do is that, and it makes it really impossible for them to ever give you a victory, because all of a sudden [PERSON] changed. If you had not noticed. I like [PERSON], but he changed, because he did not want to be considered my personal attorney. And [ORG], they rule against me so much. You know why? Because the story is - I have not spoken to any of them, any of them, since virtually they got in - but the story is that they are my puppets. Right? That they are puppets. And now the only way they can get out of that because they hate that it is not good in the social circuit. And the only way they get out is to rule against [PERSON]. So let us rule against [PERSON]. And they do that. So I want to congratulate them. But it shows you the media's genius. In fact, probably if I was the media, I'd do it the same way. I hate to say it. But we got to get them straightened out. [DATE], for the sake of our democracy, for the sake of our Constitution, and for the sake of our children, we lay out the case for the entire world to hear. You want to hear it? In every single swing state, local officials, state officials, almost all [NORP], made illegal and unconstitutional changes to election procedures without the mandated approvals by the state legislatures. That these changes paved a way for fraud on a scale never seen before. I think we go a long way outside of our country when I say that. So, just in a nutshell, you cannot make a change or voting for a federal election unless the state legislature approves it. No judge can do it. Nobody can do it. Only a legislature. So as an example, in [GPE], or whatever, you have a [NORP] legislature, you have a [NORP] mayor, and you have a lot of [NORP] all over the place. They go to the legislature. The legislature laughs at them, says we are not going to do that. They say, thank you very much and they go and make the changes themselves, they do it anyway. And that is totally illegal. That is totally illegal. You cannot do that. In [GPE], the [NORP] secretary of state and the [NORP] state [ORG] justices illegally abolished the signature verification requirements [DATE] to the election. So think of what they did. No longer is there signature verification. Oh, that is OK. We want voter ID by the way. But no longer is there a signature verification. [DATE] before the election they say we do not want it. You know why they do not want to? Because they want to cheat. That is the only reason. Who would even think of that? We do not want to verify a signature? There were [CARDINAL] more ballots counted in [GPE]. Think of this, you had [CARDINAL] more ballots than you had voters. That means you had [CARDINAL]. Where did they come from? You know where they came from? Somebody's imagination, whatever they needed. So in [GPE], you had [CARDINAL] more votes than you had voters. And the number is actually much greater than that now. That was as of [DATE]. And this is a mathematical impossibility unless you want to say it is a total fraud. So [GPE] was defrauded. [CARDINAL] 000 ballots in [GPE] were cast by people whose names and dates of birth match individuals who died in [DATE] and prior to the election. Think of that. Dead people, lots of dead people, [CARDINAL]. And some dead people actually requested an application. That bothers me even more. Not only are they voting, they want an application to vote. [CARDINAL] of them was [DATE], died. It is incredible. [CARDINAL] 000 ballots were cast by out-of-state voters, so these are voters that do not live in this state. And by the way, these numbers are what they call outcome-determinative, meaning these numbers far surpass. I lost by a very little bit. These numbers are massive, massive. [CARDINAL] 000 votes in [GPE] were illegally counted, even though they were received after [DATE]. In other words, they were received after [DATE]. Let us count them anyway. And what they did in many cases is, they did fraud. They took the date and they moved it back so that it no longer is after [DATE]. And [CARDINAL] 000 ballots in [GPE] were reported received back. They got back before they were ever supposedly mailed out. In other words, you got the ballot back before you mailed it, which is also logically and logistically impossible, right? Think of that one. You got the ballot back. Let us send the ballots. Oh, they have already been sent. But we got the ballot back before they were sent. I do not think that is too good, right? [CARDINAL] ballots in [GPE] were requested by nursing home residents, all in a single giant batch, not legal, indicating an enormous, illegal ballot harvesting operation. You are not allowed to do it, it is against the law. [DATE] before the election, the state of [GPE] reported the number of absentee ballots that had been sent out. Yet this number was suddenly and drastically increased by [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] people. It was increased, nobody knows where it came from, by [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] ballots, [DATE] after the election. It remains totally unexplained. They said, Well, ah, we cannot figure that. Now, that is many, many times what it would take to overthrow the state. Just that [CARDINAL] element. [CARDINAL] ballots appeared from nowhere right after the election. By the way, [GPE] has now seen all of this. They did not know because it was so quick. They had a vote. They voted. But now they see all this stuff, it is all come to light. Does not happen that fast. And they want to recertify their votes. They want to recertify. But the only way that can happen is if [PERSON] agrees to send it back. [PERSON] has to agree to send it back. And many people in [ORG] want it sent back. And think of what you are doing. Let us say you do not do it. Somebody says, Well, we have to obey the Constitution. And you are, because you are protecting our country and you are protecting the Constitution. So you are. But think of what happens. Let us say they are stiffs and they are stupid people, and they say, well, we really have no choice. Even though [GPE] and other states want to redo their votes. They want to see the numbers. They already have the numbers. Go very quickly. And they want to redo their legislature because many of these votes were taken, as I said, because it was not approved by their legislature. You know, that, in itself, is legal. And then you have the scam, and that is all of the things that we are talking about. But think of this. If you do not do that, that means you will have a president of [GPE] for [DATE], with his wonderful son. You will have a president who lost all of these states. Or you will have a president, to put it another way, who was voted on by a bunch of stupid people who lost all of these states. You will have an illegitimate president. That is what you will have. And we cannot let that happen. These are the facts that you will not hear from the fake news media. It is all part of the suppression effort. They do not want to talk about it. They do not want to talk about it. In fact, when I started talking about that, I guarantee you, a lot of the television sets and a lot of those cameras went off. And that is a lot of cameras back there. But a lot of them went off. But these are the things you do not hear about. You do not hear what you just heard. I am going to go over a few more states. But you do not hear it by the people who want to deceive you and demoralize you and control you. Big tech, media. Just like the suppression polls that said we are going lose [GPE] by [CARDINAL] points. Well, we won [GPE]. They do not have it that way because they lost just by a little sliver. But they had me down [DATE] before, [ORG]/ABC poll, down [CARDINAL] points. I called up a real pollster. I said, What is that? Sir, that is called a suppression poll. I think you are going to win [GPE], sir. I said, But why do not they make it [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] points? Because then people vote. But when you are down [CARDINAL], they say, Hey, I am not going to waste my time. I love the president, but there is no way. Despite that, despite that, we won [GPE]. It is going to see. I mean, you will see. But that is called suppression because a lot of people when they see that. It is very interesting. This pollster said, Sir, if you are down [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], or [CARDINAL] people vote. When you go down [CARDINAL], they say, 'Let us save. Let us go and have dinner and let us watch the presidential defeat [TIME] on television, darling.' And just like the radical left tries to blacklist you on social media. Every time I put out a tweet, that is , even if it is totally correct, totally correct, I get a flag. I get a flag. And they also do not let you get out. You know, on [ORG], it is very hard to come onto my account. It is very hard to get out a message. They do not let the message get out nearly like they should. But I have had many people say, I cannot get on your [ORG]. I do not care about [ORG]. [ORG]'s bad news. They are all bad news. But you know what, if you want to, if you want to get out a message and if you want to go through Big tech, social media, they are really, if you are a conservative, if you are a [NORP], if you have a big voice, I guess they call it shadow banned, right? Shadow banned. They shadow ban you, and it should be illegal. I have been telling these [NORP], get rid of Section 230. And for some reason, [PERSON] and the group, they do not want to put it in there and they do not realize that that is going to be the end of [ORG] as we know it, but it is never going to be the end of us. Never. Let them get out. Let, let the weak ones get out. This is a time for strength. They also want to indoctrinate your children in school by teaching them things that are not so. They want to indoctrinate your children. It is all part of the comprehensive assault on our democracy, and the [NORP] people are finally standing up and saying no. This crowd is, again, a testament to it. I did no advertising, I did nothing. You do have some groups that are big supporters. I want to thank that, [PERSON], and everybody. We have some incredible supporters, incredible. But we did not do anything. This just happened. [DATE], we had a massive crowd come down to [GPE]. I said, What are they there for? Sir, they are there for you. We have nothing to do with it. These groups are for, they are forming all over [GPE]. And we got to remember, in [DATE] from now, you are going to start working on [ORG] and we got to get rid of the weak [ORG], people, the ones that are not any good, [PERSON] of the world. We got to get rid of them. We got to get rid. You know, she never wants a soldier brought home - I brought a lot of our soldiers home. I do not know, somewhat like it. They are in countries that nobody even knows the name, nobody knows where they are. They are dying. They are great, but they are dying. They are losing their arms, their legs, their face. I brought them back home, largely back home. [GPE], [GPE]. Remember, I used to say in [DATE]: Do not go in [GPE]. But if you go in, keep the oil. We did not keep the oil. So stupid. So stupid these people. And [GPE] has [MONEY] now in the bank. And what did we do? We got nothing. We never get. But we do actually, we kept the oil here or we get, we did good. We got rid of the [ORG] caliphate. We got rid of plenty of different things that everybody knows and the rebuilding of our military in [DATE]. People said it could not be done. And it was all made in the [GPE], all made in the [GPE], best equipment in the world. In [GPE], corrupt [NORP]-run cities deployed [CARDINAL] illegal, unmanned, unsecured drop boxes, which collected a minimum of [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] unlawful votes. It was razor-thin, the loss. This [CARDINAL] thing alone is much more than we would need. But there are many things. They have these lockboxes. And, you know, they'd pick them up and they disappear for [DATE]. People would say where is that box? They disappeared. Nobody even knew where the hell it was. In addition, [CARDINAL] 000 absentee votes were counted in [GPE] without a valid absentee ballot application. So they had a vote, but they had no application, and that is illegal in [GPE]. Meaning those votes were blatantly done in opposition to state law and they came [PERCENT] from [NORP] areas such as [GPE] and [GPE], [PERCENT]. In [GPE], [CARDINAL] votes were deposited in so-called human drop boxes. You know what that is, right? Where operatives stuff [CARDINAL] of unsecured ballots into duffle bags on park benches across the city, in complete defiance of cease-and-desist letters from state legislature. Your state legislatures said do not do it. They are the only ones that can approve it. They gave [CARDINAL] of votes. They came in in duffle bags. Where the hell did they come from? According to eyewitness testimony, [ORG] workers in [GPE] were also instructed to illegally backdate [CARDINAL], 000 ballots. The margin of difference in [GPE] was [CARDINAL] 000 votes. Each one of these things alone wins us the state. Great state. We love the state. We won the state. In [GPE], your secretary of state who, I cannot believe this guy's a [NORP]. He loves recording telephone conversations. You know, that was? I thought it was a great conversation personally. So did a lot of other. People love that conversation because it says what is going on. These people are crooked. They are [PERCENT], in my opinion, one of the most corrupt, between your governor and your secretary of state. And now you have it again [TIME]. Just take a look at what happened. What a mess. And the [ORG] operatives entered into an illegal and unconstitution - unconstitutional settlement agreement that drastically weakened signature verification and other election security procedures. [PERSON]. She took them to lunch. And I beat her [DATE] with a bad candidate, [PERSON]. But they took, the [NORP] took the [NORP] to lunch because the secretary of state had no clue what the hell was happening. Unless he did have a clue. That is interesting. Maybe he was with the other side. But we have been trying to get verifications of signatures in [GPE], they will not let us do it. The only reason they will not is because we will find things in [CARDINAL]. Why would not they let us verify signatures in [GPE], which is known for being very corrupt. They will not do it. They go to some other county where you would live. I said, That is not the problem. The problem is [GPE], home of [PERSON]. She did a good job, I congratulate her. But it was done in such a way that we cannot let this stuff happen. We will not have a country if it happens. As a result, [GPE]'s absentee ballot rejection rate was [CARDINAL] times lower than previous levels because the criteria was so off. [CARDINAL] counties in [GPE], with [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] of votes, rejected [CARDINAL] ballots. There was not [CARDINAL] ballot. In other words, in [DATE] in which more mail-in ballots were sent than ever before, and more people were voting by mail for the first time, the rejection rate was drastically lower than it had ever been before. The only way this can be explained is if [CARDINAL] of illegitimate votes were added to the tally. That is the only way you could explain it. By the way, you are talking about [CARDINAL]. If [GPE] had merely rejected the same number of unlawful ballots as in other years, they should have been [CARDINAL] 000 ballots rejected. Far more than what we needed to win, [CARDINAL]. They should find those votes. They should absolutely find that. [CARDINAL], 000 votes, that is all we need. They defrauded us out of a win in [GPE], and we are not going to forget it. There is [CARDINAL] reason the [NORP] could possibly want to eliminate signature matching, opposed voter ID, and stop citizenship confirmation. Are you a citizenship? You are not allowed to ask that question, because they want to steal the election. The radical left knows exactly what they are doing. They are ruthless and it is time that somebody did something about it. And [PERSON], I hope you are going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country. And if you are not, I am going to be very disappointed in you. I will tell you right now. I am not hearing good stories. In [GPE], [NORP] poll watchers were ejected, in some cases, physically from the room under the false pretense of a pipe burst. Water main burst, everybody leave. Which we now know was a total lie. Then election officials pull boxes, [NORP], and suitcases of ballots out from under a table. You all saw it on television, totally fraudulent. And illegally scanned them for [TIME], totally unsupervised. [CARDINAL] of votes. This act coincided with a mysterious vote dump of [CARDINAL], 000 votes for [PERSON], almost none for [PERSON]. Oh, that sounds fair. That was at [TIME] The [GPE] secretary of state and pathetic governor of [GPE], have reached, although he says I am a great president. You know, I sort of maybe have to change. He said [DATE], Yes, I do. I disagree with president, but he is been a great president. Good, thanks. Thank you very much. Because of him and others, you have [PERSON]. Vote him the hell out of office, please. Well, his rates are so low. You know, his approval rating now, I think it just reached a record low. They have rejected [CARDINAL] separate appeals for an independent and comprehensive audit of signatures in [GPE]. Even without an audit, the number of fraudulent ballots that we have identified across the state is staggering. [CARDINAL] ballots in [GPE] were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match [GPE] residents who died in [DATE] and prior to the election. [CARDINAL] ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match incarcerated felons in [GPE] prison. People who are not allowed to vote. [CARDINAL] illegal ballots were cast by individuals who do not appear on the state's own voter rolls. [CARDINAL] illegal ballots were cast by individuals who registered to vote using an address listed as vacant, according to [ORG]. [CARDINAL] 000 ballots in [GPE] were cast by people whose registrations were illegally backdated. [CARDINAL] votes, each one of these is far more than we need. [CARDINAL] votes in [GPE] were cast by individuals under the legal voting age. And [CARDINAL] ballots were cast by individuals who moved out of the state prior to [DATE] election. They say they moved right back. They moved right back. Oh, they moved out, they moved right back. OK. They missed [GPE] that much. I do. I love [GPE], but it is a corrupt system. Despite all of this, the margin in [GPE] is [CARDINAL] 779 votes. Each and every one of these issues is enough to give us a victory in [GPE], a big beautiful victory. Make no mistake, this election was stolen from you, from me and from the country. And not a single swing state has conducted a comprehensive audit to remove the illegal ballots. This should absolutely occur in every single contested state before the election is certified. In the state of [GPE], [CARDINAL] 000 ballots were illegally cast by non-citizens. [CARDINAL] ballots were returned with no address. [CARDINAL] 000 ballots were returned before they were ever supposedly mailed out. They returned, but we have not mailed them yet. [CARDINAL] more ballots and votes were counted, more than there were actual voters. You see that? So you have more votes again than you have voters. [CARDINAL] people registered in [GPE] after the registration deadline. [CARDINAL] ballots in the county were sent for electronic adjudication with no [NORP] observers. In [GPE], [GPE], the accuracy settings on signature verification machines were purposely lowered before they were used to count [CARDINAL] 000 ballots. If you signed your name as [PERSON], it would go through. There were also [CARDINAL] 000 double votes in [GPE]. [CARDINAL] 000 people were hurt so badly by what took place. And [CARDINAL] ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match [GPE] residents who died in [DATE] prior to [DATE] election. [CARDINAL] 000 votes were cast by individuals who had no address and probably did not live there. The margin in [GPE] is down at a very low number, any of these things would have taken care of the situation. We would have won [GPE], also. Every one of these we are going over, we win. In [GPE], quickly, the secretary of state, a real great one, flooded the state with unsolicited mail-in ballot applications sent to every person on the rolls in direct violation of state law. [CARDINAL] 000 [GPE] ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match people who were deceased. In [GPE], that is a great one. That is [GPE]. [CARDINAL] ballots were counted without being tied to an actual registered voter. Nobody knows where they came from. Also, in [GPE], poll watchers observed canvassers rescanning batches of ballots over and over again, up to [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] times. In [GPE], turnout was [PERCENT] of registered voters. Think of that. So you had [PERCENT] of the people in [GPE] voting. This is in [GPE]. [GPE], [GPE]. A career employee of the [GPE], City of Detroit, testified under penalty of perjury that she witnessed city workers coaching voters to vote straight [NORP] while accompanying them to watch who they voted for. When a [NORP] came in, they would not talk to him. The same worker was instructed not to ask for any voter ID and not to attempt to validate any signatures if they were [NORP]. She also told to illegally, and was told, backdate ballots received after the deadline and reports that [CARDINAL] and thousands of ballots were improperly backdated. That is [GPE]. [CARDINAL] witnesses have testified under penalty of perjury that after officials in [GPE] announced the last votes had been counted, [CARDINAL] of additional ballots arrived without required envelopes. Every single one was for a [NORP]. I got no votes. At [TIME] in [TIME] after voting had ended, [GPE] suddenly reported [CARDINAL] 000 votes. [PERCENT] went to [PERSON], who campaigned brilliantly from his basement. Only a couple of percentage points went to [PERSON]. Such gigantic and one-sided vote dumps were only observed in a few swing states and they were observed in the states where it was necessary. You know what is interesting? President [PERSON] beat [PERSON] in every state other than the swing states where [PERSON] killed them, but the swing states were the ones that mattered. They are always just enough to push [PERSON] barely into the lead. We were ahead by a lot and within [TIME] we were losing by a little. In addition, there is the highly troubling matter of [ORG]. In [CARDINAL] [GPE] county alone, [CARDINAL] 000 votes were switched from [PERSON] to [PERSON] and the same systems are used in the majority of states in our country. Senator [PERSON], a great gentleman, chairman of [GPE]'s senate judiciary subcommittee. Senator [PERSON], highly respected, on elections has written a letter describing his concerns with [ORG] in [GPE]. He wrote, and I quote, The Dominion Voting Machines employed in [GPE] had an astronomical and astounding [PERCENT] error rate. It is only wrong [PERCENT] of the time in the scanning of ballots requiring a review panel to adjudicate or determine the voter's interest in [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] 000 ballots out of a total of [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL]. Think of it. You go in and you vote and then they tell people who you supposed to be voting for. They make up whatever they want. Nobody's ever even heard. They adjudicate your vote. They say, Well, we do not think [PERSON] wants to vote for [PERSON]. We think he wants to vote for [PERSON]. Put it down for [PERSON]. The national average for such an error rate is far less than 1% and yet you are at [PERCENT]. The source of this astronomical error rate must be identified to determine if these machines were set up or destroyed to allow for a third party to disregard the actual ballot cast by the registered voter. The letter continues. There is clear evidence that [CARDINAL] of votes were switched from President [PERSON] to former Vice President [PERSON] in several counties in [GPE]. For example, in [GPE], President [PERSON] was reported to have [CARDINAL] 391 votes at [TIME], while simultaneously Vice President [PERSON] was reported to have [CARDINAL] 213. [TIME], [TIME], at the next update, these vote numbers switched with President [PERSON] going way down to [CARDINAL] and [PERSON] going way up to [CARDINAL]. And that was very quick, a [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] vote switch all in Mr. [PERSON]'s favor. So, I mean, I could go on and on about this fraud that took place in every state, and all of these legislatures want this back. I do not want to do it to you because I love you and it is freezing out here. But I could just go on forever. I can tell you this. So when you hear, when you hear, while there is no evidence to prove any wrongdoing, this is the most fraudulent thing anybody has, this is a criminal enterprise. This is a criminal enterprise. And the press will say, and I am sure they will not put any of that on there, because that is no good. And you ever see, while there is no evidence to back President [PERSON]'s assertion. I could go on for [TIME] reading this stuff to you and telling you about it. There is never been anything like it. Think about it. [GPE] had more votes than it had voters. [GPE] had [CARDINAL] more votes than it had more. But you do not have to go any. Between that, I think that is almost better than dead people if you think, right? More votes than they had voters. And many other states also. It is a disgrace that [GPE], [CARDINAL] of people, are allowed to go vote without so much as even showing identification. In no state is there any question or effort made to verify the identity, citizenship, residency or eligibility of the votes cast. The [NORP] have to get tougher. You are not going to have [ORG] if you do not get tougher. They want to play so straight. They want to play so, sir, yes, [GPE]. The Constitution does not allow me to send them back to the [GPE]. Well, I say, yes it does, because the Constitution says you have to protect our country and you have to protect our Constitution, and you cannot vote on fraud. And fraud breaks up everything, does not it? When you catch somebody in a fraud, you are allowed to go by very different rules. So I hope [PERSON] has the courage to do what he has to do. And I hope he does not listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he is listening to. It is also widely understood that the voter rolls are crammed full of non-citizens, felons and people who have moved out of state and individuals who are otherwise ineligible to vote. Yet [NORP] oppose every effort to clean up their voter rolls. They do not want to clean them up. They are loaded. And how many people here know other people, that when there are [CARDINAL] and then [CARDINAL] of ballots got sent out, got [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], and I heard [CARDINAL], who got [CARDINAL] ballots. And then they say you did not quite make it, sir. We won in a landslide. This was a landslide. They said it is not [NORP] to challenge the election. This the most corrupt election in the history, maybe of the world. You know, you could go third-world countries, but I do not think they had [CARDINAL] of votes and they do not have voters for them. I mean no matter where you go, nobody would think this. In fact, it is so egregious, it is so bad that a lot of people do not even believe it. It is so crazy that people do not even believe it. It cannot be true. So they do not believe it. This is not just a matter of domestic politics - this is a matter of national security. So [DATE], in addition to challenging the certification of the election, I am calling on [ORG] and the state legislatures to quickly pass sweeping election reforms, and you better do it before we have no country left. [DATE] is not the end, it is just the beginning. With your help over [DATE], we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country and nobody even challenges that. I say that over and over, and I never get challenged by the fakeness, and they challenge almost everything we say. But our fight against the big donors, big media, big tech, and others is just getting started. This is the greatest in history. There is never been a movement like that. You look back there all the way to [FAC]. It is hard to believe. We must stop the steal and then we must ensure that such outrageous election fraud never happens again, can never be allowed to happen again. But we are going forward. We will take care of going forward. We have got to take care of going back. Do not let them talk. OK, well, we promised. I have had a lot of people. Sir, you are at [PERCENT] for [DATE]. I said I am not interested right now. I am interested in right there. With your help, we will finally pass powerful requirements for voter ID. You need an ID to cash a check. You need an ID to go to a bank, to buy alcohol, to drive a car. Every person should need to show an ID in order to cast your most important thing, a vote. We will also require proof of [NORP] citizenship in order to vote in [NORP] elections. We just had a good victory in court on that one, actually. We will ban ballot harvesting and prohibit the use of unsecured drop boxes to commit rampant fraud. These drop boxes are fraudulent. Therefore, they get disapp - they disappear, and then all of a sudden they show up. It is fraudulent. We will stop the practice of universal unsolicited mail-in balloting. We will clean up the voter rolls that ensure that every single person who casts a vote is a citizen of our country, a resident of the state in which they vote and their vote is cast in a lawful and honest manner. We will restore the vital civic tradition of in-person voting on [DATE] so that voters can be fully informed when they make their choice. We will finally hold big tech accountable. And if these people had courage and guts, they would get rid of Section 230, something that no other company, no other person in [GPE], in the world has. All of these tech monopolies are going to abuse their power and interfere in our elections, and it has to be stopped. And the [NORP] have to get a lot tougher, and so should the [NORP]. They should be regulated, investigated, and brought to justice under the fullest extent of the law. They are totally breaking the law. Together, we will drain the [GPE] swamp and we will clean up the corruption in our nation's capital. We have done a big job on it, but you think it is easy. It is a dirty business. It is a dirty business. You have a lot of bad people out there. Despite everything we have been through, looking out all over this country and seeing fantastic crowds. Although this, I think, is our all-time record. I think you have [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] people. [CARDINAL]. Looking out at all the amazing patriots here [DATE], I have never been more confident in our nation's future. Well, I have to say, we have to be a little bit careful. That is a nice statement, but we have to be a little careful with that statement. If we allow this group of people to illegally take over our country because it is illegal when the votes are illegal when the way they got there is illegal when the states that vote are given false and fraudulent information. We are the greatest country on Earth and we are headed and were headed in the right direction. You know, the wall is built. We are doing record numbers at the wall. Now, they want to take down the wall. Let us let everyone flow in. Let us let everybody flow in. We did a great job in the wall. Remember, the wall, they said it could never be done. [CARDINAL] of the largest infrastructure projects we have ever had in this country, and it is had a tremendous impact, that we got rid of catch and release. We got rid of all of this stuff that we had to live with. But now, the caravans, I think [PERSON]'s getting in, the caravans are forming again. They want to come in again and rip off our country. Cannot let it happen. As this enormous crowd shows, we have truth and justice on our side. We have a deep and enduring love for [GPE] in our hearts. We love our country. We have overwhelming pride in this great country and we have it deep in our souls. Together, we are determined to defend and preserve government of the people, by the people and for the people. [DATE] are before us. Our greatest achievements, still away. I think one of our great achievements will be election security. Because nobody until I came along had any idea how corrupt our elections were. And again, most people would stand there at [TIME] and say I want to thank you very much, and they go off to some other life. But I said something's wrong here, something is really wrong, can have happened. And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you do not fight like hell, you are not going to have a country anymore. Our exciting adventures and boldest endeavors have not yet begun. My fellow [NORP], for our movement, for our children, and for our beloved country. And I say this despite all that is happened. The best is yet to come. So we are going to, we are going to walk down [FAC]. I love [FAC]. And we are going to the [FAC], and we are going to try and give. The [NORP] are hopeless - they never vote for anything. Not even [CARDINAL] vote. But we are going to try and give our [NORP], the weak ones because the strong ones do not need any of our help. We are going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country. So let us walk down [FAC]. I want to thank you all. God bless you and God Bless [GPE]. Thank you all for being here. This is incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "abcnewsgocomPoliticsstateunionaddressreadtranscriptstoryid96970217", "text": "Mr. [PERSON]. Thank you. You can smile. It is okay. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. Please. Mr. [PERSON], Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman good to see you guys up theremembers of [ORG] And, by the way, Chief Justice, I may need a court order. She gets to go to the game tomorr- next week. I have to stay home. We got to work something out here. Members of the [ORG], leaders of our military, Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and retired Justices of [ORG], and to you, my fellow [NORP]: You know, I start [TIME] by congratulating the 118th [ORG] and the new Speaker of the [ORG], [PERSON]. Speaker, I do not want to ruin your reputation, but I look forward to working with you. And I want to congratulate the new Leader of the [ORG] [NORP], the first [NORP] Minority Leader in history, [PERSON]. He won despite the fact I campaigned for him. Congratulations to the longest-serving Leader in the history of [ORG], [PERSON]. Where are you, [PERSON]? And congratulations to [PERSON], another you know, another term as [ORG] Minority [Majority] Leader. You know, I think you only this time you have a slightly bigger majority, Mr. [PERSON]. And you are the Majority Leader. About that much bigger? Yeah. Well, I tell you what I want to give specolec- special recognition to someone who I think is going to be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of [ORG]: [PERSON]. Folks, the story of [GPE] is a story of progress and resilience, of always moving forward, of never, ever giving up. It is a story unique among all nations. We are the only country that has emerged from every crisis we have ever entered stronger than we got into it. Look, folks, that is what we are doing again. [DATE], the economy was reeling. I stand here [TIME], after we have created, with the help of many people in this room, [CARDINAL] new jobs more jobs created in [DATE] than any President has created in [DATE] because of you all, because of the [NORP] people. [DATE] and [DATE], [ORG] had shut down our businesses were closed, our schools were robbed of so much. And [DATE], [ORG] no longer controls our lives. And [DATE], our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. And [DATE], though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken. As we gather here [TIME], we are writing the next chapter in the great [NORP] story a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define [GPE] and they do, believe it or not I say I can define it in [CARDINAL] word, and I mean this: possibilities. We do not think anything is beyond our capacity. Everything is a possibility. You know, we are often told that [NORP] and [NORP] cannot work together. But over [DATE], we proved the cynics and naysayers wrong. Yes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when [NORP] went alone. But time and again, [NORP] and [NORP] came together. Came together to defend a stronger and safer Europe. You came together to pass [CARDINAL] in a gen- [CARDINAL]-in-a-generation once-in-a-generation infrastructure law building bridges connecting our nation and our people. We came together to pass [CARDINAL] the most significant law ever helping victims exposed to toxic burn pits. And, in fact it is important. And, in fact, I signed over [CARDINAL] bipartisan pieces of legislation since becoming President, from reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act to the Electoral Count Reform Act, the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love. And to my [NORP] friends, if we could work together in the last [ORG], there is no reason we cannot work together and find consensus on important things in this [ORG] as well. I think folks, you all are just as informed as I am, but I think the people sent us a clear message: Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict gets us nowhere. That is always been my vision of our country, and I know it is many of yours: to restore the soul of this nation; to rebuild the backbone of [GPE], [GPE]'s middle class; and to unite the country. We have been sent here to finish the job, in my view. For [DATE], the middle class has been hollowed out in more than and not in [CARDINAL] administration, but for a long time. Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories closed down. Once-thriving cities and towns that many of you represent became shadows of what they used to be. And along the way, something else we lost: pride, our sense of self-worth. I ran for President to fundamentally change things. To make sure the economy works for everyone so we can all feel that pride in what we do. To build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well. I know a lot of you always kid me for always quoting my dad. But my dad used to say, [PERSON], a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. He really would say this. It is about a lot more than a paycheck. It is about your dignity. It is about respect. It is about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it is going to be okay' and mean it. Well, folks, so let us look at the results. We are not finished yet, by any stretch of the imagination. But unemployment rate is at [PERCENT] -- a [DATE] low. And near record and near record unemployment near record unemployment for [NORP] and [NORP] workers. We have already created, with your help, [CARDINAL] 000 good-paying manufacturing jobs the fastest growth in [DATE]. And where is it written where is it written that [GPE] cannot lead the world in manufacturing? And I do not know where that is written. For too many [DATE], we imported projects and exported jobs. Now, thanks to what you have all done, we are exporting [NORP] products and creating [NORP] jobs. Folks, inflation inflation has been a global problem because the pandemic dirup- disrupted our supply chains, and [PERSON]'s unfair and brutal war in [GPE] disrupted ener- energy supplied as well as food supplies, blocking all that grain in [GPE]. But we are better positioned than any country on Earth right now. But we have more to do. But here at home, inflation is coming down. Here at home, gas prices are down $[MONEY] from their peak. Food inflation is coming down not fast enough, but coming down. Inflation has fallen [DATE] for [DATE], while take-home pay has gone up. Additionally, over [DATE], [CARDINAL] [NORP] applied to start new businesses. [CARDINAL]. And, by the way, every time every time someone starts a small business, it is an act of hope. And, Madam Vice President, I want to thank you for leading that effort to ensure that small businesses have access to capital and the historic laws we enacted that are going to just come into being. Standing here [DATE], I shared with you a story of [NORP] genius and possibilities. Semiconductors small computer chips the size of a fingerprint that power everything from cellphones to automobiles and so much more. These chips were invented in [GPE]. Let us get that straight: They were invented in [GPE]. And we used to make [PERCENT] of the world's chips. In [DATE], we lost our edge. We are down to only producing [PERCENT]. We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip factories shut down overseas. [DATE]'s automobiles need [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] chips each of those automobiles but [NORP] automobiles [automakers] could not make enough cars because there were not enough chips. Car prices went up. People got laid off. So did everything from refrigerators to cellphones. We can never let that happen again. That is why that is why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act. Folks, I know I have been criticized for saying this, but I am not changing my view. We are going to make sure the supply chain for [GPE] begins in [GPE] the supply chain begins in [GPE]. And we have already created we have already created [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] new manufacturing jobs without this law, before the law kicks in. With this new law, we are going to create [CARDINAL] of new jobs across the country. And I mean all across the country, throughout not just the coast, but through the middle of the country as well. That is going to come from companies that have announced [MONEY] in investments in [NORP] manufacturing over [DATE]. Outside of [GPE], [GPE], [ORG] is building semiconductor factories on [QUANTITY] literally a field of dreams. It is going to create [CARDINAL] 000 jobs, that [CARDINAL] investment; [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] construction jobs; [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] jobs in those factories once they are finished. They call them factors. Jobs paying an average of $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] a year, and many do not require a college degree. Jobs because we worked together, these jobs where people do not have to leave home to search for opportunity. And it is just getting started. Think about the new homes, the small businesses, the big the medium-sized businesses. So much more that is going to be needed to support those [CARDINAL] thou- those [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] permanent jobs and the factories that are going to be built. Talk to mayors and governors, [NORP] and [NORP], and they will tell you what this means for their communities. We are seeing these fields of dreams transform the Heartland. But to maintain the strongest economy in the world, we need the best infrastructure in the world. And, folks, as you all know, we used to be number [CARDINAL] in the world in infrastructure. We have sunk to 13th in the world. [GPE] 13th in the world in infrastructure, modern infrastructure. But now we are coming back because we came together and passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law the largest investment in infrastructure since President [PERSON]'s [ORG]. Folks, already we have funded [CARDINAL], 000 projects, including major airports from [GPE] to [GPE] to [GPE] projects that are going to put [CARDINAL] of people to work rebuilding our highways, our bridges, our railroads, our tunnels, ports, airports, clean water, high-speed Internet all across [GPE] urban, rural, Tribal. And, folks, we are just getting started. We are just getting started. And I mean this sincerely: I want to thank my [NORP] friends who voted for the law. And my [NORP] friends who voted against it as well but I am still I still get asked to fund the projects in those districts as well, but do not worry. I promised I'd be a President for all [NORP]. We will fund these projects. And I will see you at the groundbreaking. Look, this law this law will further unite all of [GPE]. Projects like [FAC] in [GPE] over the Ohio River. Built [DATE]. Badly in need of repairs. [CARDINAL] of the nation's most congested freight routes, carrying [MONEY] worth of freight [DATE] across the Ohio River. And, folks, we have been talking about fixing it for [DATE], but we are really finally going to get it done. I went there [DATE] with [NORP] and [NORP] in from both states to deliver a commitment of [MONEY] for this project. And while I was there, I met a young woman named [PERSON], who is here [TIME]. I do not know where [PERSON] is. Is she up in the box? I do not know. [PERSON], how are you? Well, [PERSON] for [DATE] for [DATE] I learned she told me she'd been a proud member of [ORG], known as known as [ORG] the folks who built who built [GPE]'s skyline. [PERSON] said she cannot wait to be [QUANTITY] above the Ohio River building that new bridge. [PERSON] bless her.That is pride. And that is what we are also building we are building back pride. Look, we are also replacing poisonous lead pipes that go into [CARDINAL] homes in [GPE], [CARDINAL] schools and childcare centers so every child in [GPE] every child in [NORP] can drink the water, instead of having permanent damage to their brain. Look, we are making sure we are making sure that every community every community in [GPE] has access to affordable, high-speed Internet. No parent should have to drive by a [ORG] parking lot to help their do their homework online with their kids, which many thousands were doing across the country. And when we do these projects and, again, I get criticized about this, but I make no excuses for it we are going to buy [NORP]. We are going to buy [NORP]. Folks and it is totally it is totally consistent with international trade rules. Buy American has been the law since [DATE]. But for too long, past administrations [NORP] and [NORP] have fought to get around it. Not anymore. [TIME], I am also announcing new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infra- infrastructure projects to be made in [GPE]. Made in [GPE]. I mean it. Lumber, glass, drywall, fiber-optic cable. And on my watch, [NORP] roads, bridges, and [NORP] highways are going to be made with [NORP] products as well. Folks, my economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten. So many of you listening [TIME], I know you feel it. So many of you felt like you have just simply been forgotten. Amid the economic upheaval of [DATE], too many people have been left behind and treated like they are invisible. Maybe that is you, watching from home. You remember the jobs that went away. You remember them, do not you? The folks at home remember them. You wonder whether the path even exists anymore for your children to get ahead without having to move away. Well, that is why I get that. That is why we are building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of choices we made in [DATE]. You know, this is, in my view, a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild [GPE] and make a real difference in your lives at home. For example, too many of you lay in bed at [TIME], like my dad did, staring at the ceiling, wondering what in God's name happens if yo- if your spouse gets cancer or your child gets deadly ill or if something happens to you. What are you going are you going to have the money to pay for those medical bills? Are you going to have to sell the house or try to get a second mortgage on it? I get it. I get it. With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law, we are taking on powerful interests to bring healthcare costs down so you can sleep better at [TIME] with more security. You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any nation in the world. Let me say it again: We pay more for prescription drugs than any major nation on Earth. For example, [CARDINAL] in [CARDINAL] [NORP] has diabetes. Many of you in this chamber do and in the audience. But [DATE], [CARDINAL] need insulin to control their diabetes so they can literally stay alive. Insulin has been around for [DATE]. The guy who invented it did not even patent it because he wanted it to be available for everyone. It costs the drug companies [MONEY] a vial to make that insulin. Package it and all, you may get [MONEY]. But [ORG] has been unfairly charging people [MONEY] [MONEY] a month making rec- record profits. Not anymore. Not anymore. So so many things that we did are only now coming to fruition. We said we were doing this and we said we'd pass the law to do it, but people did not know because the law did not take effect until [DATE]. We capped the cost of insulin at $[MONEY] a month for seniors on [ORG]. But people are just finding out. I am sure you are getting the same calls I am getting. Look, there are [CARDINAL] of other [NORP] who do not are not on [ORG], including [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] young people with Type 1 diabetes who need these insulin need this insulin to stay alive. Let us finish the job this time. Let us cap the cost of insulin for everybody at $[MONEY]. Folks and Big Pharma is still going to do very well, I promise you all. I promise you they are going to do very well. This law also this law also caps and it will not even go into effect until [DATE]. It costs [caps] out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on [ORG] at a maximum of $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] a year. You do not have to pay [MONEY], 000 a year, no matter how much your drug costs are. Because you know why? You all know it. Many of you, like many of my family, have cancer. You know the drugs can range from $10-, $11-, $14-, $[MONEY], 000 for the cancer drugs. And if drug prices rise faster than inflation, drug companies are going to have to pay [ORG] back the difference. And we are finally we are finally giving [ORG] the power to negotiate drug prices. Bringing down bringing down prescription drug costs does not just save seniors money, it cuts the federal deficit by [MONEY] by [MONEY] because these prescription drugs are drugs purchased by [ORG] to make keep their commitment to the seniors. Well, guess what? Instead of paying [MONEY] a month, you are paying [CARDINAL]. That is a lot of savings for the federal government. And, by the way, why would not we want that? Now, some members here are threatening and I know it is not an official party position, so I am not going to exaggerate but threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act. As my coach that is okay. That is fair. As my football coach used to say, Lots of luck in [DATE]. Make no mistake, if you try anything to raise the cost of prescription drugs, I will veto it. And, look, I am pleased to say that more [NORP] health have health insurance now than ever in history. A record [CARDINAL] people are enrolled in the Affordable Care Act. And thanks thanks to the law I signed [DATE], saving [CARDINAL] are saving $[MONEY] a year on their premiums. And, by the way, that law was written and the benefit expires in [DATE]. So, my plea to some of you, at least in this audience: Let us finish the job and make those savings permanent. Expand coverage on [ORG]. Look, the Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever in climate change ever. Lowering utility bills, creating [NORP] jobs, leading the world to a clean energy future. I visited the devastating aftermath of record floods, droughts, storms, and wildfires from [GPE] to [GPE] to all the way up to the [NORP] border. More timber has been burned that I have observed from helicopters than the entire state of [GPE]. And we do not have global warming? Not a problem. In addition to emergency recovery from [GPE] to [GPE] to [GPE], we are rebuilding for the long term. New electric grids that are able to weather major storms and not prevent those fire forest fires. Roads and water systems to withstand the next big flood. Clean energy to cut pollution and create jobs in communities often left behind. We are going to build [CARDINAL] electric vehicle charging stations, installed across the country by [CARDINAL] of [ORG] workers. And we are helping families save [MONEY] a year with tax credits to purchase of electric vehicles and efficient and efficient appliances energy-efficient appliances. Historic conservation efforts to be responsible stewards of our land. Let us face reality. The climate crisis does not care if you are in a red or a blue state. It is an existential threat. We have an obligation not to ourselves, but to our children and grandchildren to confront it. I am proud of how the how [GPE], at last, is stepping up to the challenge. We are still going to need oil and gas for a while, but guess what no, we do but there is so much more to do. We got to finish the job. And we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the wealthiest and biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share. Just begin. Look, I am a capitalist. I am a capitalist. But pay your fair share. I think a lot of you at home a lot of you at home agree with me and many people that you know: The tax system is not fair. It is not fair. Look, the idea that in [DATE], [CARDINAL] of the largest corporations in [GPE], the Fortune 500, made [MONEY] in profits and paid [CARDINAL] in federal taxes? [CARDINAL]. Folks, it is simply not fair. But now, because of the law I signed, [MONEY] companies have to pay a minimum of [PERCENT]. God love them. [PERCENT]. That is less than a nurse pays. Let me be crystal clear. I said at the very beginning: Under my plans, as long as I am President, nobody earning [MONEY], 000 will pay [MONEY] in taxes. Nobody. Not [MONEY]. But let us finish the job. There is more to do. We have to reward work, not just wealth. Pass my proposal for the billionaire minimum tax. You know, there is [CARDINAL] billionaires in [GPE] it is up from [CARDINAL] at the beginning of my term but no billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter. No, I mean it. Think about it. I mean, look, I know you all are not enthusiastic about that, but think about it. Think about it. Have you noticed [ORG] just reported its profits. Record profits. [DATE], they made [MONEY] in the midst of a global energy crisis. I think it is outrageous. Why? They invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production. And when I talked to a couple of them, they say, We were afraid you were going to shut down all the oil wells and all the oil refineries anyway, so why should we invest in them? I said, We are going to need oil for [DATE], and that is going to exceed and beyond that. We are going to need it. Production. If they had, in fact, invested in the production to keep gas prices down instead they used the record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders. Corporations ought to do the right thing. That is why I propose we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks and encourage long- long-term investments. They will still make considerable profit. Let us finish the job and close the loopholes that allow the very wealthy to avoid paying their taxes. Instead of cutting the number of audits for wealthy taxpayers, I just signed a law to reduce the deficit by [MONEY] by cracking down on wealthy tax cheats. That is being fiscally responsible. In [DATE], my administration has cut the deficit by [MONEY] -- the largest deficit reduction in [NORP] history. Under the previous administration, the [NORP] deficit went up [DATE]. Because of those record deficits, no President added more to the national debt in [DATE] than my predecessor. [PERCENT] of the entire national debt that took [DATE] to accumulate was added by [CARDINAL] administration alone the last one. They are the facts. Check it out. Check it out. How did [ORG] respond to that debt? They did the right thing. They lifted the debt ceiling [CARDINAL] times without preconditions or crisis. They paid the [NORP] bill to prevent an economic disaster of the country. So, [TIME] I am asking the [ORG] to follow suit. Let us commit here [TIME] that the full faith and credit of [GPE] will never, ever be questioned. So my many of some of my [NORP] friends want to take the economy hostage I get it unless I agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what those plans are. Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some [NORP] some [NORP] want [ORG] and [ORG] to sunset. I am not saying it is a majority Anybody who doubts it, contact my office. I will give you a copy. I will give you a copy of the proposal. That means [ORG] does not vote Well, I am glad to see no, I tell you, I enjoy conversion. You know, it means if [ORG] does not keep the programs the way they are, they'd go away. Other [NORP] say I am not saying it is a majority of you. I do not even think it is a significant but it is being proposed by individuals. I am not politely not naming them, but it is being proposed by some of you. Look, folks, the idea is that we are not going to be we are not going to be moved into being threatened to default on the debt if we do not respond. Folks so, folks, as we all apparently agree, [ORG] and [ORG] is off the off the books now, right? They are not to be touched? All right. All right. We got unanimity! [ORG] and [ORG] are a lifeline for [CARDINAL] of seniors. [NORP] have to pay into them from the very first paycheck they have started. So, [TIME], let us all agree and we apparently are let us stand up for seniors. Stand up and show them we will not cut [ORG]. We will not cut [ORG]. Those benefits belong to the [NORP] people. They earned it. And if anyone tries to cut [ORG] which apparently no one is going to do and if anyone tries to cut [ORG], I will stop them. I will veto it. And, look, I am not going to allow them to take away be taken away. Not [DATE]. Not [DATE]. Not ever. But apparently, it is not going to be a problem. [DATE], when I offer my fiscal plan, I ask my [NORP] friends to lay down their plan as well. I really mean it. Let us sit down together and discuss our mutual plans together. Let us do that. I can tell you, the plan I am going to show you is going to cut the deficit by [MONEY]. And it will not cut a single bit of [ORG] or [ORG]. In fact, we are going to extend [ORG] [DATE], because that is going to be the next argument: how do we make keep it solvent. Right? Well, I will not raise taxes on anyone making [MONEY]. But we will pay for it the way we talked about [TIME]: by making sure that the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share. Look look, look, here is here is the deal. They are not just taking advantage of the tax code, they are taking advantage of you, the [NORP] consumer. Here is my message to all of you out there: I have your back. We are already preventing [NORP] who are [from] receiving surprise medical bills, stopping [MONEY] [1 million] surprise bills per month so far. We are protecting seniors' life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs that are not needed. [CARDINAL] of [NORP] can now save [CARDINAL] of dollars because they can finally get a hearing aid over the counter without a prescription. Look, capitalism without competition is not capitalism. It is extortion. It is exploitation. [DATE], I cracked down, with the help of many of you, on foreign shipping companies that were making you pay higher prices for every good coming into the country. I signed a bipartisan bill that cut shipping costs by [PERCENT], helping [NORP] farmers, businessmen, and consumers. Let us finish the job. Pass the bipartisan legislation to strengthen and to strengthen antitrust enforcement and forbeg- and prevent big online platforms from giving their own products an unfair advantage. My administration is also taking on junk fees, those hidden surcharges too many companies use to make you pay more. For example, we are making airlines show you the full ticket price upfront, refund your money if your flight is cancelled or delayed. We have reduced exorbitant bank overdrafts by saving consumers [MONEY] a year. We are cutting credit card late fees by [PERCENT], from $[MONEY] to $[MONEY]. Look, junk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most other folks in homes like the one I grew up in, like many of you did. They add up to [MONEY] a month. They make it harder for you to pay your bills or afford that family trip. I know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you and gets away with it. Not anymore. We have written a bill to stop it all. It is called the Junk Fee Prevention Act. We are going to ban surprise resort fees that hotels charge on your bill. Those fees can cost you [MONEY] a night at hotels that are not even resorts. We the idea that cable, Internet, and cellphone companies can charge you $[MONEY] or more if you decide to switch to another provider. Give me a break. We can stop service fees on tickets to concerts and sporting events and make companies disclose all the fees upfront. And we will prohibit airlines from charging $[MONEY] roundtrip for a family just to be able to sit together. Baggage fees are bad enough. Airlines cannot treat your child like a piece of baggage. [NORP] are tired of being we are tired of being played for suckers. So pass pass the Junk Fee Prevention Act so companies stop ripping us off. For too long, workers have been getting stiffed, but not anymore. We are going to be we are beginning to restore the dignity of work. For example, I I should have known this, but I did not until [DATE]: [CARDINAL] workers have to sign non-compete agreements for the jobs they take. [CARDINAL]. So a cashier at a burger place cannot walk across town and take the same job at another burger place and make [MONEY] more. It just changed. Well, they just changed it because we exposed it. That was part of the deal, guys. Look it up. But not anymore. We are banning those agreements so companies have to compete for workers and pay them what they are worth. And I must tell you, this is bound to get a response from my friends on my left, with the right. I am so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing. Pass the PRO Act! Because businesses have a right workers have a right to form a union. And let us guarantee all workers have a living wage. Let us make sure working parents can afford to raise a family with sick days, paid family and medical leave, affordable childcare. That is going to enable [CARDINAL] of more people to go and stay at work. And let us restore the full Child Tax Credit which gave [CARDINAL] of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in [CARDINAL] to the lowest level in history. And, by the way, when we do all of these things, we increase productivity, we increase economic growth. So let us finish the job and get more families access to affordable, quality housing. Let us get seniors who want to stay in their homes the care they need to do so. Let us give more breathing room to [CARDINAL] of family caregivers looking after their loved ones. Pass my plan so we get seniors and people with disabilities the home care services they need and support the workers who are doing God's work. These plans are fully paid for, and we can afford to do them. Restoring the dignity of work means making education an affordable ticket to the middle class. You know, when we made public education [DATE] of it universal in [DATE], we made the best-educated, best-paid we became the best-education, best-paid nation in the world. But the rest of the world has caught up. It has caught up. [PERSON], my wife, who teaches full-time, has an expression. I hope I get it right, kid. Any nation that out-educates is going to out-compete us. Any nation that out-educates is going to out-compete us. Folks, we all know [DATE] of education is not enough to win the economic competition of [DATE]. If we want to have the best-educated workforce, let us finish the job by providing access to preschool for [DATE]. Studies show that children who go to preschool are [PERCENT] more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a two- or [DATE] degree, no matter their background they came from. Let us give public school teachers a raise. We are making progress by reducing student debt, increasing Pell Grants for working and middle-class families. Let us finish the job and connect students to career opportunities starting in high school, provide access to [DATE] of community college the best career training in [GPE], in addition to being a pathway to a [DATE] degree. Let us offer every [NORP] a path to a good career, whether they go to college or not. And, folks folks, in the midst of the COVID crisis, when schools were closed and we were shutting down everything, let us recognize how far we came in the fight against the pandemic itself. While the virus is not gone, thanks to the resilience of the [NORP] people and the ingenuity of medicine, we have broken the COVID grip on us. COVID deaths are down by [PERCENT]. We have saved [CARDINAL] of lives and opened up our country we opened our country back up. And soon, we will end the public health emergency. But that is called a public health emergency. But we will remember the toll and pain that is never going to go away. [CARDINAL] [NORP] lost their lives to COVID. [CARDINAL]. Families grieving. Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table constantly reminding you that she used to sit there. Remembering them, we remain vigilant. We still need to monitor [CARDINAL] of variants and support new vaccines and treatments. So [ORG] needs to fund these efforts and keep [GPE] safe. And as we emerge from this crisis stronger, we are also got to double down prosecuting criminals who stole relief money meant to keep workers and small businesses afloat. Before I came to office, you remember, during that campaign, the big issue was about inspector generals who would protect taxpayers' dollars, who were sidelined. They were fired. Many people said, We do not need them. And fraud became rampant. [DATE], I told you the watchdogs are back. Since then since then, we have recovered [CARDINAL] of taxpayers' dollars. Now let us triple the anti-fraud strike force going after these criminals, double the statute of limitations on these crimes, and crack down on identity fraud by criminal syndicates stealing [MONEY] from the [NORP] people. And the data shows that for every dollar we put into fighting fraud, the taxpayer will get back [CARDINAL] times as much. It matters. It matters. Look, COVID left its scars, like the spike in violent crime in [DATE] [DATE] of the pandemic. We have an obligation to make sure all people are safe. Public safety depends on public trust, as all of us know. But too often, that trust is violated. Joining us [TIME] are the parents of [PERSON] who had to bury [PERSON] [DATE]. As many of you personally know, there is no words to describe the heartache or grief of losing a child. But imagine imagine if you lost that child at the hands of the law. Imagine having to worry whether your son or daughter came home from walking down the street or playing in the park or just driving a car. Most of us in here have never had to have the talk the talk that brown and Black parents have had to have with their children. [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON] my children I never had to have the talk with them. I never had to tell them, If a police officer pulls you over, turn your interior lights on right away. Do not reach for your license. Keep your hands on the steering wheel. Imagine having to worry like that every single time your kid got in a car. Here is what [PERSON]'s mother shared with me when I spoke to her, when I asked her how she finds the courage to carry on and speak out. With the faith of God, she said her son was, quote, a beautiful soul and something good will come of this. Imagine how much courage and character that takes. It is up to us, to all of us. We all want the same thing: neighborhoods free of violence, law enfircement [sic] law enforcement who earns the community's trust. Just as every cop, when they pin on that badge in [TIME], has a right to be able to go home at [TIME], so does everybody else out there. Our children have a right to come home safely. Equal protection under the law is a covenant we have with each other in [GPE]. We know police officers put their lives on the line every single night and day. And we know we ask them, in many cases, to do too much to be counselors, social workers, psychologists responding to drug overdoses, mental health crises, and so much more. In [CARDINAL] sense, we ask much too much of them. I know most cops and their families are good, decent, honorable people the vast majority. And they risk and they risk their lives every time they put that shield on. But what happened to [PERSON] in [GPE] happens too often. We have to do better. Give law enforcement the real training they need. Hold them to higher standards. Help them to succeed in keeping them safe. We also need more first responders and professionals to address the growing mental health, substance abuse challenges. More resources to reduce violent crime and gun crime. More community intervention programs. More investments in housing, education, and job training. All this can help prevent violence in the first place. And when police officers or police departments violate the public trust, they must be held accountable. With the support with the support of families of victims, civil rights groups, and law enforcement, I signed an executive order for all federal officers, banning chokeholds, restricting no-knock warrants, and other key elements of the George Floyd Act. Let us commit ourselves to make the words of [PERSON]'s [[PERSON]'s] mom true: Something good must come from this. Something good. And all of us all of us folks, it is difficult, but it is simple: All of us in the cha- in this chamber, we need to rise to this moment. We cannot turn away. Let us do what we know in our hearts that we need to do. Let us come together to finish the job on police reform. Do something. Do something. That was the plea of parents who lost their children in [GPE] I met with every one of them Do something about gun violence. Thank God thank God we did, passing the most sweeping gun safety law in [DATE]. That includes things like that the majority of responsible gun owners already support: enhanced background checks for [DATE], red-flag laws keeping guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and others. But we know our work is not done. Joining us [TIME] is [PERSON], a [DATE] hero. [PERSON] put his college dreams on hold to be at his mom's side his mom's side when she was dying from cancer. And [PERSON] now works at the dance studio started by his grandparents. And [DATE], during the Lunar New Year celebrations, he heard the studio door close, and he saw a man standing there pointing a semi-automatic pistol at him. He thought he was going to die, but he thought about the people inside. In that instant, he found the courage to act and wrestled the semi-automatic pistol away from the gunman who had already killed [CARDINAL] people in another dance studio. [CARDINAL]. He saved lives. It is time we do the same. Ban assault weapons now! Ban them now! Once and for all. I led the fight to do that in [DATE]. And in [DATE] that ban was law, mass shootings went down. After we let it expire in a [NORP] administration, mass shootings tripled. Let us finish the job and ban these assault weapons. And let us also come together on immigration. Make it a bipartisan issue once again. We know we now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] human smugglers, seizing [QUANTITY] of fentanyl in just the last several months. We have launched a new border plan [DATE]. Unlawful migration from [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE] has come down [PERCENT] as a consequence of that. But [NORP] border problems will not be fixed until [ORG] acts. If we do not pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border and a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers, those on temporary status, farmworkers, essential workers. Here in [ORG], it is our duty to protect all the people's rights and freedoms. [ORG] must restore the right and [ORG] must restore the right that was taken away in Roe v. Wade and protect Roe v. Wade. Give every woman the constitutional right. The Vice President and I are doing everything to protect access to reproductive healthcare and safeguard patient safety. But already, [CARDINAL] states are enforcing extreme abortion bans. Make no mistake about it: If [ORG] passes a national ban, I will veto it. But let us also pass let us also pass the bipartisan Equality Act to ensure LBG- LGBTQ [NORP], especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity. Our strength our strength is not just the example of our power, but the power of our example. Let us remember, the world is watching. I spoke from this chamber [DATE], [DATE] after [PERSON] unleashed his brutal attack against [GPE], a murderous assault, evoking images of death and destruction Europe suffered in World War Two. [PERSON]'s invasion has been a test for the ages a test for [GPE], a test for the world. Would we stand for the most basic of principles? Would we stand for sovereignty? Would we stand for the right of people to live free of tyranny? Would we stand for the defense of democracy? For such defense matters to us because it keeps peace and prevents open season on would-be aggressors that threatens our prosperity. [DATE], we know the answer. Yes, we would. And we did. We did. And together, we did what [GPE] always does at our best. We led. We united [ORG]. We built a global coalition. We stood against [PERSON]'s aggression. We stood with the [NORP] people. [TIME], we are once again joined by [NORP]' Ambassador to [GPE]. She represents not her just her nation but the courage of her people. Ambassador is our Ambassador is here, united in our we are united in our support of your country. Will you stand so we can all take a look at you? Thank you. Because we are going to stand with you as long as it takes. Our nation is working for more freedom, more dignity, and more more peace, not just in Europe, but everywhere. Before I came to office, the story was about how [GPE] was increasing its power and [GPE] was failing in the world. Not anymore. We made clear and I made clear in my personal conversations, which have been many, with President [PERSON] that we seek competition, not conflict. But I will make no apologies that we are investing and to make [GPE] stronger. Investing in [NORP] innovation and industries that will define the future that [GPE] intends to be dominating. Investing in our alliances and working with our allies to protect advanced technologies so they will not be used against us. Modernizing our military to safeguard stability and determine deter aggression. [DATE], we are in the strongest position in [DATE] to compete with [GPE] or anyone else in the world. Anyone else in the world. And I am committed I am committed to work with [GPE] where we can advance [NORP] interests and benefit the world. But make no mistake about it: As we made clear [DATE], if [GPE] threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did. Look, let us be clear: Winning the competition should unite all of us. We face serious challenges across the world. But in [DATE], democracies have become stronger, not weaker. Autocracies have grown weaker, not stronger. Name me a world leader who'd change places with [PERSON]. Name me one. Name me one. [GPE] is rallying the world to meet those challenges from climate to global health to food insecurity to terrorism to territorial aggression. Allies are stepping up, spending more, and doing more. Look, the bridges we are forming between partners in the Pacific and those in the Atlantic. And those who bet against [GPE] are learning how wrong they are. It is never, ever been a good bet to bet against [GPE]. Never. When I came to office, most assured that bipartisanship assumed was impossible. But I never believed it. That is why [DATE], I offered a Unity Agenda to the nation as I stood here. We made real progress together. We passed the law making it easier for doctors to prescribe effective treatments for opioid addiction. We passed the gun safety law, making historic investments in mental health. We launched the ARPA-H drive for breakthroughs in the fight against cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes, and so much more. We passed the Heath Robinson PACT Act, named after the late Iraq War veteran whose story about exposure to toxic burn pits I shared here [DATE]. And I understand something about those burn pits. But there is so much more to do. And we can do it together. Joining us [TIME] is a father named [PERSON] from [GPE], [GPE]. He wrote [PERSON], my wife, a letter and me as well about his courageous daughter, [PERSON]. A contagious laugh. His sister's best friend her sister's best friend. He shared a story all too familiar to [CARDINAL] of [NORP] and many of you in the audience. [PERSON] discovered pills in high school. It spiraled into addiction and eventually death from a fentanyl overdose. She was [DATE]. Describing [DATE] without her, [PERSON] said, There is no worse pain. Yet, their family has turned pain into purpose, working to end the stigma and change laws. He told us he wants to start a journey towards [NORP] recovery. [PERSON], we are with you. Fentanyl is killing [CARDINAL] [NORP] a year. Big Big you got it. So let us launch a major surge to stop fentanyl production and the sale and trafficking. With more drug detection machines, inspection cargo, stop pills and powder at the border. Working with couriers, like [ORG], to inspect more packages for drugs. Strong penalties to crack down on fentanyl trafficking. Second, let us do more on mental health, especially for our children. When [CARDINAL] of young people are struggling with bullying, violence, trauma, we owe them greater access to mental health care at their schools. We must finally hold social media companies accountable for experimenting they are doing running [on] children for profit. And it is time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and impose stricter limits on the personal data that companies collect on all of us. Third, let us do more to keep this nation's [CARDINAL] fully sacred obligation: to equip those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come home. Job training, job placement for veterans and their spouses as they come to return to civilian life. Helping veterans to afford their rent, because no one should be homeless in [GPE], especially someone who served the country. [PERSON] [sic] [PERSON] is here, of the [ORG]. We had our first real discussion when I asked him to take the job. I am glad he did. We were losing [CARDINAL] veterans a day on suicide. Now we are losing [CARDINAL] a day to the silent scourge of suicide. [CARDINAL] veterans a day are committing suicide, more than all the people being killed in the wars. Folks, [ORG] is doing everything it can, including expanding mental health screening, proven programs that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they are going through, get them the help they need. We got to do more. And fourth, [DATE], [PERSON] and I reignited the Cancer Moonshot that I was able to start with, and President [PERSON] asked me to lead our administration on this issue. Our goal is to cut the cancer death rates at least by [PERCENT] in [DATE], turn more cancers from death sentences to treatable diseases, provide more support for patients and their families. It is personal to so many of us so many of us in this audience. Joining us are [PERSON] and [PERSON], an [NORP] and a daughter of immigrants from [GPE]. They met and fell in love in [GPE] and got married in the same chapel as [PERSON] and I got married in [GPE]. Kindred spirits. He wrote us a letter about his little daughter, [PERSON]. And I saw her just before I came over. She was [DATE] when she was diagnosed with a rare kidney disease cancer. After [CARDINAL] blood transfusions, [CARDINAL] rounds of radiation, [CARDINAL] rounds of cheno [sic] chemo, [CARDINAL] kidney removed, given a [PERCENT] survival rate. He wrote how, in the darkest moments, he thought, If she goes, I cannot stay. Many of you have been through that as well. [PERSON] and I understand that, like so many of you. And he read [PERSON]'s book describing our family's cancer journey and how we tried to steal moments of joy where we could with [PERSON]. For them, that glimmer of joy was the [CARDINAL]-smile of their baby girl. It meant everything to them. They never gave up hope, and little [PERSON] never gave up hope. She turns [DATE] [DATE]. They just found out [PERSON] is beating the odds and is on her way to being cured of cancer. And she is watching from [FAC] [TIME], if she is not asleep already. For the lives we can save for the lives we can save and the lives we have lost, let this be a truly [NORP] moment that rallies the country and the world together and prove that we can still do big things. .Twenty years ago, under the leadership of President [PERSON] and countless advocates and champions, he undertook a bipartisan effort through [ORG] to transform the global fight against HIV/AIDS. It is been a huge success. He thought big. He thought large. He moved! I believe we can do the same thing with cancer. Let us end cancer as we know it and cure some cancers once and for all. Folks, there is [CARDINAL] reason why we have been able to do all of these things: our democracy itself. It is the most fundamental thing of all. With democracy, everything is possible. Without it, nothing is. Over [DATE], our democracy has been threatened and attacked, put at risk put to the test in this very room on [DATE]. And then, [DATE], an unhinged Big Lie assailant unleashed a political violence at the home of the then-Speaker of [ORG], using the very same language the insurrectionists used as they stalked these halls and chanted on [DATE]. Here [TIME], in this chamber, is the man who bears the scars of that brutal attack but is as tough and as strong and as resilient as they get: my friend, [PERSON]. [PERSON], stand up. But such a heinous act should have never happened. We must all speak out. There is no place for political violence in [GPE]. We have to protect the right to vote, not suppress the that fundamental right. Honor the results of our elections, not subvert the will of the people. We have to uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our institutions of democracy. And we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor. Democracy must not be a partisan issue. It is an [NORP] issue. Every generation of [NORP] have faced a moment where they have been called to protect our democracy, defend it, stand up for it. And this is our moment. My fellow [NORP], we meet [TIME] at an inflection point, [CARDINAL] of those moments that only a few generations ever face, where the direction we now take is going to decide the course of this nation for [DATE] to come. We are not bystanders of history. We are not powerless before the forces that confront us. It is within our power of [ORG]. We are facing the test of our time. We have to be the nation we have always been at our best: optimistic, hopeful, forward-looking. A nation that embraces light over dark, hope over fear, unity over division, stability over chaos. We have to see each other not as enemies, but as fellow [NORP]. We are a good people. The only nation in the world built on an idea the only one. Other nations are defined by geography, ethnicity, but we are the only nation based on an idea that all of us, every [CARDINAL] of us, is created equal in the image of God. A nation that stands as a beacon to the world. A nation in a new age of possibilities. So I have come to fulfill my constitutional obligation to report on the state of the Union. And here is my my report: Because the soul of this nation is strong, because the backboken [sic] backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the state of the Union is strong. I am not new to this place. I stand here [TIME] having served as long as about any one of you who have ever served here. But I have never been more optimistic about our future about the future of [GPE]. We just have to remember who we are. We are [GPE]. And there is nothing nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "duckworthsenategovnewspressreleasesduckworthinfirstspeechonsenateflooramericasprosperityandstrengthdependonourvalues", "text": "Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you to my friend and mentor-and a great [NORP]-Senator [PERSON], for being here [DATE]. I would not be here without your guidance and friendship. It is truly an honor to stand at this desk, which was once held by another great [NORP] by the name of [PERSON], delivering my maiden speech from the floor of [ORG] [ORG] to the people of [GPE], the same state that is been represented in [GPE] by other impressive leaders like [PERSON] and [PERSON]. And it is an honor to address the people of [GPE]; the greatest nation in the world. Though we have occasionally made choices as a society that do not reflect our best selves, we are [DATE] the greatest nation in the world because of the founding ideals that have anchored our nation and because of the shared values that have guided the development and strength of our economy and people. Values like treating each other equally, showing strength and resilience in the face of hardship, and embracing the diversity that makes us who we are. They are shared values that have helped us to strive toward that more perfect union the Constitution's framers envisioned. A more perfect union that offers everyone a chance to reach his or her potential, a more perfect union that will not give up on its people, and a more perfect union whose people do not give up on themselves. We face a great deal of challenges and threats-threats I know well-but we cannot allow [DATE]'s hardships to change who we are as a people, to tear down the pillars that make our nation great. Falling victim to fear and demagoguery will only ensure a weaker [GPE] for our children, and that is not a future that I want for my [DATE] daughter [PERSON]. When we as a society think about the future we want for all our children, it is important to remember how we got here. Our nation was not founded as the dominant global economic and military force it is [DATE]. We were not founded as the leader of the free world. Our people built that. [NORP] understood that when we invest in ourselves, the fabric that holds our country together only grows stronger. A scrappy gang of patriots in the American Revolution-my own family included-won us our liberty, which we used to push for greater civil and human rights and to make investments in agricultural and educational systems that sparked our economy allowing us to strengthen our military into the greatest fighting force the world has ever seen. Success was never easy or guaranteed. From our founding, [GPE] was forged through fierce debates and stark divisions. Slavery led to bloodshed across the country-including in the [ORG] chamber-and culminated in brothers killing brothers during our civil war. Yet our union made it through our greatest challenges and emerged stronger. We emerged a more perfect union. Our strength has been on display outside of our military as well when heroes like [PERSON] and [PERSON] risked everything to help bring an end to slavery. When [PERSON], had a dream and when the children of the Little Rock Nine braved harassment and abuse to bring an end to segregated schools and ensure educational opportunity for all. And when the backbreaking work of [NORP] and [NORP] laborers united our nation from sea to shining sea with the completion of the transcontinental railroad. [GPE] catalyzed the industrial revolution, helped rescue the global community from fascism during World War II, promoted civil and human rights around the globe, explored space, launched the internet revolution, helped feed the world, built a world-class infrastructure network, developed a gold standard education system, and grew the strongest economy ever seen. We were able to win World War II not only because of the brave troops in our [ORG], but also because our nation's manufacturers and steel mills were able to produce the tanks, planes, firearms and other tools we needed to defeat the [NORP]. We were only able to build those weapons, launch the internet revolution and send a man to the moon because we had a well-educated workforce made of people from around the globe who all had an opportunity to attend the world-class colleges and universities we'd spent generations strengthening. Our economy was able to grow to its current strength not only because of our well-educated workforce and those who came from distant lands and stayed to contribute to our society, but also because we'd invested heavily in infrastructure and built an interstate system and air and rail networks that enabled our farmers, ranchers and other producers to get their goods to market inside and outside of this country's borders. We were able to feed the world not only because of our strong agricultural sector and infrastructure, but also because of the scientific advances, supported by our educational institutions, that helped increase farm production and yields. Throughout our history, we pushed to expand human and civil rights, from the abolitionists to the suffragettes, learning from people like the Tuskegee Airmen, the Selma marchers and the LGBTQ leaders [DATE] that being inclusive and enabling people to reach their full potential only strengthens the [NORP] core. We did all of these things as a result of our shared values, and we have reaped their rewards for generations. We have seen our nation's strength in our prouder moments like when [GPE] chose to go to the moon - not because it was easy but, as President [PERSON] said, because it was hard. And we have seen our strength in tragedy, reuniting under a common purpose in the rubble of the [FAC] and [FAC] on 9/11. We might get knocked down, but the [GPE] that I know-that I fought for and love-does not give up. That is not a democratic principle or a republican principle, it is the [NORP] way. [GPE]'s greatness has never depended on the strength of any individual person, but on all of us, working together towards a common goal. But when we have failed to stay true to our core values - when we deny another person our nation's promise of opportunity - our national strength suffers. When a child cannot access the tools to succeed in school, when a woman cannot afford basic health care, when refugees fleeing terror see the door slammed in their face, when we deny civil rights on the basis of skin color or sexual orientation or religion, and when a working family cannot put food on the table, our whole nation suffers. At the end of the day, [GPE]'s greatness depends on each of us remaining true to the common values of our nation. But we have lost sight of those values. The nation that built an interstate highway system, that was a refuge for immigrants who became the foundation of our economy, that pushed humanity to new heights, first with planes and helicopters and then into space. That same nation seems to have forgotten how to invest in itself. Our country that ushered in the era of aviation is now home to aging airports that struggle to compete with their global competitors. Our country, which took on the herculean task of reversing the flow of the [GPE] River to protect the city's drinking water, can no longer muster the resources to modernize public water systems to prevent our children from being poisoned by lead. And our country that built the greatest military the world has ever seen-sending a signal that we will not cower to anyone-now finds itself with leaders who believe in the misguided notion that it is better for us to hide behind walls than to help lead with strength. Make no mistake, [GPE] has not lost her greatness-our nation remains the dominant force on the global stage-but if we do not act, our adversaries are positioned to overtake us. Though some may try to convince us the path forward is less engagement with the world, less acceptance of others and less investment in ourselves. I know that the path forward for our country cannot include-does not include-turning our backs on the shared values that built our nation. Perhaps more than any other state, [GPE] knows this. We represent all the strengths of our nation, from our dynamic cities to our strong rural and industrial communities and everything in between. We are the realization of the values that have created a robust [NORP] economy, bolstered by a strong agricultural community and manufacturing sector, both of which innovate and strengthen our nation with the help of wise public policy and investments. Those investments enabled [GPE] steelworkers to help us develop our farm land, build our cities and secure our military strength. [NORP] manufacturing literally built this nation. But too many of the steel mills we relied on to win World War II have been idled or shuttered completely. After [DATE] of illegal trade practices like dumping of cheap foreign products and currency manipulation by our competitors, our manufacturing base has been weakened. That hurts not only [NORP] jobs, but also our nation's military strength as well the resilience of our entire economy. We need to do a better job of keeping manufacturing jobs within our borders and we need to make the investments necessary to ensure we have a workforce trained for our [DATE] jobs. We can do better by [GPE]'s [CARDINAL] of farmers, ranchers and agricultural workers as well. They all wake up with a purpose, each farm feeding [CARDINAL] people [DATE] while supporting an industry that is developing cutting-edge biofuels and other technologies. I have seen firsthand the painful price our nation pays because of our over-reliance on oil imported from our competitors and the simple fact is that [NORP] farmers are helping us improve our national security, helping strengthen our [ORG] and our entire country [DATE]. Our farmers are already helping produce [QUANTITY] of clean fuel for our cars, our factories and our military - and every single one of them helps bring us closer to energy independence. We cannot afford to leave them behind. We should be working to preserve policies like the Renewable Fuel Standard that support agriculture jobs and to open new markets, like [GPE], for their goods. For [DATE], our manufacturers and agricultural sector have relied on a strong infrastructure network-including roads, bridges, waterways, railways and air transportation-to get their goods to market, both domestically and internationally. [GPE] has often led the way, having built the nation's first elevated electric rail line in [DATE]. But [DATE], far too much of that infrastructure is crumbling-in dire need of the investments our society once understood the need for. The down-payments previous generations made pay dividends to us all in the form of increased tourism revenue, lower-cost and more efficient shipments, easier travel and many other benefits. If we fail to continue the investments past generations have made, we risk falling behind our global competitors, hurting not only our tourism industry, but also our manufacturers and our hardworking ranchers, farmers, and producers who will find it harder and more expensive to move their goods to market. If we choose to disregard our infrastructure much longer, we simply will not be able to compete in the [DATE] global economy. Improving our infrastructure is not a partisan issue; it is common sense. It is an economic priority, a defense priority and a national security imperative. This is something we can all work on together, and I am proud to say that the first bill I proposed after arriving in the [ORG] passed unanimously-with bipartisan support-and it will cut red tape and help streamline efforts to modernize our infrastructure while helping create jobs in [GPE] and around the country. Modernizing our nation's infrastructure will allow our economy to continue growing for generations to come. That is also true of supporting our schools, colleges and universities. We have developed a global gold standard of education that enabled our manufacturers, agricultural workers, engineers and brilliant [NORP] across all sectors to push our economy even further. There is a reason that wealthy elites across the globe, including world leaders, still send their children to our shores to be educated at world class institutions like [ORG] and [ORG]. Our education system is widely recognized as the best in the world. Our teachers and institutions continue to produce some of the best trained and most skilled professionals in every field imaginable, both [NORP] and international students. That is a good thing. But more and more [NORP] are no longer able to access those same educational opportunities. We have priced too many of our own children out of the market for the colleges and universities that we have developed to ensure our nation's workforce remains more skilled than our competitors. Or saddled them with crippling debt. And we are failing to make the necessary investments in K-12 public institutions that - regardless of zip code - should be preparing every single one of our children to lead our country into the future. Quality primary education should not be a privilege only for the wealthy, and it should not depend on rolling the dice on receiving a voucher. In the greatest and wealthiest nation in the world, a quality education should be a right for every single [NORP] child. Our nation's promise of opportunity should be a reality for every child in [GPE], not just for those whose parents can afford it. We already have some of the world's greatest teachers, brightest students and best facilities within our own borders. All we need to do is ensure they have the resources they need to succeed. That means our kids should not have to worry about going to school hungry. Or getting the help they need after school. Or about being able to pay for college when they graduate high school. That is why I have focused on common-sense solutions to help increase access to educational opportunity, whether by helping lead the charge to make college more affordable or doing more to ensure the education we are providing people actually helps them find good-paying jobs when they graduate. In that vein, I am also disheartened by the recent erosion of civil rights protections in our nation. The calls for bigger walls and closed doors are not only bad, costly policies, they run counter to our society's shared value for inclusion over exclusion. Too many of us seem to forget the immigrant roots within our own families. If we lose sight of our nation's founding principles, as some in [GPE] would like us to do, we will lose out on the innovations we have seen from immigrants and immigrant families. If we had rejected immigrants [DATE], [ORG] might never have been founded by the son of a [NORP] man. I worry that, at a time when we still have so much work to do to make our union more perfect and to provide truly equal rights for all, under the current [ORG] we are at risk of backtracking on hard-fought progress made by civil rights leaders who bled - and even died - for the right of all [NORP], regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, income, or zip code to have the right to vote, to have equal protection under the law, to have basic worker protections and for the everyday rights and privileges so many of us take for granted. We still have so much progress left to make if we want the American Dream to be accessible to all [NORP]; equal pay for equal work, a criminal justice system that truly provides justice for all, nation-wide leave policies that enable everyone to take time to care for a sick family member or start a family, a society that is accessible for disabled [NORP] and truly equal for LGBTQ [NORP]. I worry that we are at risk of going backward rather than forward. Failing to continue our nation's inclusive nature weakens our global standing as well, as the rest of the world begin to look elsewhere for moral leadership. That would be a failure for [GPE], and a weakening of our nation that I will fight to prevent. And, of course, I also know how much our military has contributed to our nation's greatness throughout our history. We must do a better job of recognizing those contributions. Not just by purchasing equipment and technology, though what our skilled workforce has developed for them is the envy of the world, but also by ensuring that we recognize and respect the sacrifices made by our troops, our military families and our [ORG]. Servicemembers embody our values of shared sacrifice and perseverance, of loyalty and selfless service-and they each make great sacrifices to protect us. They deserve from their leaders in [GPE] a clear sense of mission and strategy and they deserve to know we fully support them. So, when the drums of war are beating in [FAC] or in [ORG], you can bet that I am going to be right here on the floor of the [ORG] asking the tough questions and making sure our leaders in [GPE], especially those who have never served in uniform, fully consider the true costs of war-not just in dollars and cents but in human lives. I will also be there to remind my colleagues that we are all dishonored when any Veteran is forced lay their head down to sleep on the same streets they defended. And when our troops come home, I will be working to ensure that our Veterans receive the care and support they have earned from the sacrifices they have made. Each of these components of our society contribute to what has made this country great: our military, our values, our infrastructure, our agriculture, our manufacturers, and our world-class educational system. If we fall prey to our fears, to our worst demons, and allow any of these pillars to fall, we will lose our opportunity to remain the envy of the world. We can rebuild the foundation of our nation's strength and revamp it for [DATE]. But we cannot simply rest on our past successes and act like our greatness is guaranteed forever. It is not . This is deeply personal for me-I would not be here [DATE] without the education that enabled me to serve in our military for [DATE] and give back to my country, both in and out of uniform. And our nation would not be as strong as it is [DATE] without the [CARDINAL] of individuals who sacrificed to build it. Our nation's strength-what makes [NORP] great-is rooted firmly in our shared sense of sacrifice. It comes from our single parents, working multiple jobs just to make sure their kids do not go to school hungry. It comes from the farmer in [GPE], waking long before dawn and working long after dusk to help power and feed our nation. It comes from the immigrant family, willing to put everything on the line to give their kids a chance at a better life than their own. It comes from the hard work, the compassion, the sacrifice that [NORP] serving their country in and out of the military demonstrate [DATE]. We can all do a better job of remembering the shared values that have helped build this nation, but I want to be clear about one thing: [GPE] is already great. We should not let anyone tell us otherwise. We know we still have a lot work to do as a country, but let us not lose sight of the core values that make our improbable union possible. We are still the greatest nation on the face of the earth, and if anyone has the capacity to overcome the challenges of [DATE], it is the [NORP] people.

First of all, somebody who I believe is [CARDINAL] of the finest governors in this country -- [PERSON] is here. The lieutenant-governor and soon-to-be junior senator from the great state of [GPE] -- or [GPE] -- I was thinking about my own home -- [PERSON] is here. I used to hear that line all the time about senator from [GPE] -- that would be me. Outstanding mayor of [GPE], [PERSON] is here. The mayor of [GPE], [PERSON].

[TIME], everybody. It is good to be back in [GPE]. You know, in [DATE], [CARDINAL] of the last rallies of my presidential campaign was right here in the [GPE] area. It was a hopeful time, [DATE] before the election. And we knew that if we pulled it off, we'd finally have the chance to tackle some big and difficult challenges that had been facing this country for a very long time. We also hoped for a chance to get beyond some of the old political divides -- between [NORP] and [NORP], red states and blue states -- that had prevented us from making progress. Because although we are proud to be [NORP], we are prouder to be [NORP] -- -- and we believed then and we believe now that no single party has a monopoly on wisdom. That is not to say that the election did not expose deep differences between the parties. I ran for President because for much of [DATE], a very specific governing philosophy had reigned about how [GPE] should work: Cut taxes, especially for millionaires and billionaires. Cut regulations for special interests. Cut trade deals even if they did not benefit our workers. Cut back on investments in our people and in our future -- in education and clean energy, in research and technology. The idea was that if we just had blind faith in the market, if we let corporations play by their own rules, if we left everyone else to fend for themselves that [GPE] would grow and [GPE] would prosper. And for a time this idea gave us the illusion of prosperity. We saw financial firms and CEOs take in record profits and record bonuses. We saw a housing boom that led to new homeowners and new jobs in construction. Consumers bought more condos and bigger cars and better TVs. But while all this was happening, the broader economy was becoming weaker. Nobody understands that more than the people of [GPE]. Job growth [DATE] was slower than it had been in any economic expansion since World War II -- slower than it is been over [DATE]. The wages and incomes of middle-class families kept falling while the cost of everything from tuition to health care kept on going up. Folks were forced to put more debt on their credit cards and borrow against homes that many could not afford to buy in the first place. And meanwhile, a failure to pay for [CARDINAL] wars and [CARDINAL] tax cuts for the wealthy helped turn a record surplus into a record deficit. I ran for President because I believed that this kind of economy was unsustainable -- for the middle class and for the future of our nation. I ran because I had a different idea about how [GPE] was built. It was an idea rooted in my own family's story. You see, [PERSON] and I are where we are [DATE] because even though our families did not have much, they worked tirelessly -- without complaint -- so that we might have a better life. My grandfather marched off to Europe in World War II, while my grandmother worked in factories on the home front. I had a single mom who put herself through school, and would wake before dawn to make sure I got a decent education. [PERSON] can still remember her father heading out to his job as a city worker long after multiple sclerosis had made it impossible for him to walk without crutches. He always got to work; he just had to get up a little earlier. Yes, our families believed in the [NORP] values of self-reliance and individual responsibility, and they instilled those values in their children. But they also believed in a country that rewards responsibility; a country that rewards hard work; a country built on the promise of opportunity and upward mobility. They believed in an [GPE] that gave my grandfather the chance to go to college because of the GI Bill; an [GPE] that gave my grandparents the chance to buy a home because of [ORG]; an [GPE] that gave their children and grandchildren the chance to fulfill our dreams thanks to college loans and college scholarships. It was an [GPE] where you did not buy things you could not afford; where we did not just think about [DATE] -- we thought about [DATE]. An [GPE] that took pride in the goods that we made, not just the things we consumed. An [GPE] where a rising tide really did lift all boats, from the company CEO to the guy on the assembly line. That is the [GPE] I believe in. That is the [GPE] I believe in. That is what led me to work in the shadow of a shuttered steel plant on the South Side of [GPE] when I was a community organizer. It is what led me to fight for factory workers at manufacturing plants that were closing across [GPE] when I was a senator. It is what led me to run for President -- because I do not believe we can have a strong and growing economy without a strong and growing middle class. Now, much has happened since that election. The flawed policies and economic weaknesses of [DATE] culminated in a financial crisis and the worst recession of our lifetimes. And my hope was that the crisis would cause everybody, [NORP] and [NORP], to pull together and tackle our problems in a practical way. But as we all know, things did not work out that way. Some [NORP] leaders figured it was smart politics to sit on the sidelines and let [NORP] solve the mess. Others believed on principle that government should not meddle in the markets, even when the markets are broken. But with the nation losing [CARDINAL], 000 jobs [DATE] that I was sworn into office, my most urgent task was to stop a financial meltdown and prevent this recession from becoming a second depression. And, [GPE], we have done that. The economy is growing again. The financial markets have stabilized. The private sector has created jobs for [DATE]. And there are [CARDINAL] [NORP] who are working [DATE] because of the economic plan we put into place. But the truth is progress has been painfully slow. [CARDINAL] of jobs were lost before our policies even had a chance to take effect. We lost [CARDINAL] in [DATE] before I took office. It was a hole so deep that even though we have added jobs again, [CARDINAL] of [NORP] remain unemployed. [CARDINAL] of families have lost their homes. [CARDINAL] more can barely pay the bills or make the mortgage. The middle class is still treading water, and those aspiring to reach the middle class are doing everything they can to keep from drowning. And meanwhile, some of the very steps that were necessary to save the economy -- like temporarily supporting the banks and the auto industry -- fed the perception that [ORG] is still ignoring the middle class in favor of special interests. And so people are frustrated and they are angry and they are anxious about the future. I understand that. I also understand that in a political campaign, the easiest thing for the other side to do is to ride this fear and anger all the way to [DATE]. That is what is happening right now. [DATE], the [NORP] leader of the [ORG] came here to [GPE] and offered his party's answer to our economic challenges. Now, it would be [CARDINAL] thing if he had admitted his party's mistakes during [DATE] that they were in power, if they had gone off for a while and meditated, and come back and offered a credible new approach to solving our country's problems. But that is not what happened. There were no new policies from Mr. [PERSON]. There were no new ideas. There was just the same philosophy that we had already tried during [DATE] that they were in power -- the same philosophy that led to this mess in the first place: Cut more taxes for millionaires and cut more rules for corporations. Instead of coming together like past generations did to build a better country for our children and grandchildren, their argument is that we should let insurance companies go back to denying care for folks who are sick, or let credit card companies go back to raising rates without any reason. Instead of setting our sights higher, they are asking us to settle for a status quo of stagnant growth and eroding competitiveness and a shrinking middle class. [GPE], that is not the [GPE] I know. That is not the [GPE] we believe in. A lot has changed since I came here in [DATE] of the last election, but what has not is the choice facing this country. It is still fear versus hope; the past versus the future. It is still a choice between sliding backward and moving forward. That is what this election is about. That is the choice you will face in [DATE]. Now, we have a different vision for the future. See, I have never believed that government has all the answers to our problems. I have never believed that government's role is to create jobs or prosperity. I believe it is the drive and the ingenuity of our entrepreneurs, our small businesses; the skill and dedication of our workers -- -- that is made us the wealthiest nation on Earth. I believe it is the private sector that must be the main engine for our recovery. I believe government should be lean; government should be efficient. I believe government should leave people free to make the choices they think are best for themselves and their families, so long as those choices do not hurt others. But in the words of the first [NORP] President, [PERSON], I also believe that government should do for the people what they cannot do better for themselves. And that means making the long-term investments in this country's future that individuals and corporations cannot make on their own: investments in education and clean energy, in basic research and technology and infrastructure. That means making sure corporations live up to their responsibilities to treat consumers fairly and play by the same rules as everyone else. Their responsibility is to look out for their workers, as well as their shareholders, and create jobs here at home. And that means providing a hand-up for middle-class families -- so that if they work hard and meet their responsibilities, they can afford to raise their children, and send them to college, see a doctor when they get sick, retire with dignity and respect. That is what we [NORP] believe in -- a vibrant free market, but one that works for everybody. That is our vision. That is our vision for a stronger economy and a growing middle class. And that is the difference between what we and [NORP] in [ORG] are offering the [NORP] people right now. Let me give you a few specific examples of our different approaches. [DATE], I proposed some additional steps to grow the economy and help businesses spur hiring. [CARDINAL] of the keys to job creation is to encourage companies to invest more in [GPE]. But for [DATE], our tax code has actually given [MONEY] in tax breaks that encourage companies to create jobs and profits in other countries. I want to change that. I want to change that. Instead of tax loopholes that incentivize investment in overseas jobs, I am proposing a more generous, permanent extension of the tax credit that goes to companies for all the research and innovation they do right here in [GPE], right here in [GPE]. And I am proposing that all [NORP] businesses should be allowed to write off all the investment they do in [DATE]. And this will help small businesses upgrade their plants and equipment, and will encourage large corporations to get off the sidelines and start putting their profits to work in places like [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE]. Now, to most of you, I will bet this just seems like common sense. But not to Mr. [PERSON] and his allies. For [DATE], [NORP] have fought to keep these corporate loopholes open. In fact, when Mr. [PERSON] was here in [GPE] he attacked us for closing a few of these loopholes -- and using the money to help states like [GPE] keep [CARDINAL] of teachers and cops and firefighters on the job. Mr. [PERSON] dismissed these jobs we saved -- teaching our kids, patrolling our streets, rushing into burning buildings -- as government jobs -- jobs I guess he thought just were not worth saving. And I could not disagree more. I think teachers and police officers and firefighters are part of what keeps [GPE] strong. And, [GPE], I think if we are going to give tax breaks to companies, they should go to companies that create jobs in [GPE] -- not that create jobs overseas. That is [CARDINAL] difference between the [NORP] vision and the [NORP] vision. That is what this election is all about. Let me give you another example. We want to put more [NORP] back to work rebuilding [GPE] -- our roads, our railways, our runways. When the housing sector collapsed and the recession hit, [CARDINAL] in every [CARDINAL] jobs lost were in the construction industry. That is partly why our economic plan has invested in badly needed infrastructure projects over [DATE] -- not just roads and bridges, but high-speed railroads and expanded broadband access. Altogether, these projects have led to [CARDINAL] of good, private sector jobs, especially for those in the trades. Mr. [PERSON] and the [NORP] in [ORG] said no to these projects. Fought them tooth and nail. Though I should say it did not stop a lot of them from showing up at the ribbon-cuttings -- -- trying to take credit. That is always a sight to see. Now, there are still [QUANTITY] of railroads and railways and runways left to repair and improve. And engineers, economists, governors, mayors of every political stripe believe that if we want to compete in this global economy, we need to rebuild this vital infrastructure. There is no reason Europe or [GPE] should have the fastest trains or the most modern airports -- we want to put people to work building them right here in [GPE]. So [DATE], I have proposed a [DATE] infrastructure plan that would start putting [NORP] to work right away. But despite the fact that this has traditionally been an issue with bipartisan support, Mr. [PERSON] has so far said no to infrastructure. That is bad for [GPE] -- and that, too, is what this election is all about. I will give you [CARDINAL] final example of the differences between us and the [NORP], and that is on the issue of tax cuts. Under the tax plan passed by the last administration, taxes are scheduled to go up substantially [DATE] -- for everybody. By the way, this was by design. When they passed these tax cuts in [DATE] and [DATE], they did not want everybody to know what it would do to our deficit, so they pretended like they were going to end, even though now they say they do not . Now, I believe we ought to make the tax cuts for the middle class permanent. For the middle class, permanent. These families are the ones who saw their wages and incomes flat-line over [DATE] -- you deserve a break. You deserve some help. And because folks in the middle class are more likely to spend their tax cut on basic necessities, that strengthens the economy as a whole. But the [NORP] leader of the [ORG] does not want to stop there. Make no mistake: He and his party believe we should also give a permanent tax cut to the wealthiest 2 percent of [NORP]. With all the other budgetary pressures we have -- with all the [NORP]' talk about wanting to shrink the deficit -- they would have us borrow [MONEY] over [DATE] to give a tax cut of [MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] each to folks who are already millionaires. And keep in mind wealthy [NORP] are just about the only folks who saw their incomes rise when [NORP] were in charge. And these are the folks who are less likely to spend the money -- which is why economists do not think tax breaks for the wealthy would do much to boost the economy. So let me be clear to Mr. [PERSON] and everybody else: We should not hold middle-class tax cuts hostage any longer. We are ready, [DATE], if they want, to give tax cuts to every [NORP] making $[MONEY], 000 or less. That is [PERCENT] of [NORP]. Now, for any income over this amount, the tax rates would just go back to what they were under President [PERSON]. This is not to punish folks who are better off -- [PERSON] bless them. It is because we cannot afford the [MONEY] price tag. And for those who claim that our approach would somehow be bad for growth and bad for small businesses, let me remind you that with those tax rates in place, under President [PERSON], this country created [CARDINAL] jobs and raised incomes and had the largest surplus in our history. In fact, if the [NORP] leadership in [ORG] really wants to help small businesses, they will stop using legislative maneuvers to block an up or down vote on a small business jobs bill that is before the [ORG] right now. Right now. This is a bill that would do [CARDINAL] things. It would cut taxes for small businesses and make loans more available for small businesses. It is fully paid for, will not add to the deficit. And it was written by [NORP] and [NORP]. And yet, the other party continues to block this jobs bill -- a delay that small business owners have said is actually leading them to put off hiring. Look, I recognize that most of the [NORP] in [ORG] have said no to just about every policy I have proposed since taking office. I realize in some cases that there are genuine philosophical differences. But on issues like this one -- a tax cut for small businesses supported by [ORG] -- the only reason they are holding this up is politics, pure and simple. They are making the same calculation they made just before my inauguration: If I fail, they win. Well, they might think that this will get them to where they want to go in [DATE], but it will not get our country going where it needs to go in the long run. It will not get us there. It will not get us there. It will not get us there. So that is the choice, [GPE]. Do we return to the same failed policies that ran our economy into a ditch, or do we keep moving forward with policies that are slowly pulling us out? Do we settle for a slow decline, or do we reach for an [GPE] with a growing economy and a thriving middle class? That is the [GPE] that I see. We may not be there yet, but we know where this country needs to go. We see a future where we invest in [NORP] innovation and [NORP] ingenuity; where we export more goods so we create more jobs here at home; where we make it easier to start a business or patent an invention; where we build a homegrown, clean energy industry -- because I do not want to see new solar panels or electric cars or advanced batteries manufactured in Europe or Asia. I want to see them made right here in the [GPE] by [NORP] workers. We see an [GPE] where every citizen has the skills and training to compete with any worker in the world. That is why we have set a goal to once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by [DATE]. That is why we are revitalizing community colleges like this one. That is why we are reforming our education system based on what works for our children, not what perpetuates the status quo. We see an [GPE] where a growing middle class is the beating heart of a growing economy. That is why I kept my campaign promise and gave a middle-class tax cut to [PERCENT] of working [NORP]. That is why we passed health insurance reform that stops insurance companies from jacking up your premiums at will or denying coverage because you get sick. That is why we passed financial reform that will end taxpayer-funded bailouts; reform that will stop credit card companies and mortgage lenders from taking advantage of taxpayers and consumers. That is why we are trying to make it easier for workers to save for retirement and fighting the efforts of some in the other party to privatize [ORG] -- because as long as I am President, no one is going to take the retirement savings of a generation of [NORP] and hand it over to Wall Street. Not on my watch. That is why we are fighting to extend the child tax credit and make permanent our new college tax credit, because if we do, it will mean $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] in tuition relief for each child going to [DATE] of college. And I do not want any parent not to be sending their kids, in good time or bad, to college because they cannot afford it. And finally, we see an [GPE] where we refuse to pass on the debt we inherited to the next generation. Now, let me spend [TIME] on this issue, because we have heard a lot of moralizing on the other side about this -- government spending and debt. Along with the tax cuts for the wealthy, the other party's main economic proposal is that they will stop government spending. Now, it is right to be concerned about the long-term deficit. If we do not get a handle on it soon, it can endanger our future. And at a time when folks are tightening their belts at home, I understand why a lot of [NORP] feel it is time for government to show some discipline, too. But let us look at the facts. When these same [NORP] -- including Mr. [PERSON] -- were in charge, the number of earmarks and pet projects went up, not down. These same [NORP] turned a record surplus into a record deficit. When I walked in, wrapped in a nice bow was a [MONEY] deficit sitting right there on my doorstep. A welcoming present. [DATE], these same [NORP] voted against a bipartisan fiscal commission that they themselves had proposed. Once I decided I was for it, they were against it. And when you ask them what programs they'd actually cut they do not have an answer. That is not fiscal responsibility. That is not a serious plan to govern. Now, I will be honest -- I refuse to cut back on those investments that will grow our economy in the future -- investments in areas like education and clean energy and technology. I do not want to cut those things. And that is because economic growth is the single best way to bring down the deficit -- and we need these investments to grow. But I am absolutely committed to fiscal responsibility, which is why I have already proposed freezing all discretionary spending unrelated to national security for [DATE]. And once the bipartisan fiscal commission finishes its work, I will spend [DATE] making the tough choices necessary to further reduce our deficit and lower our debt -- whether I get help from the other side or not. Of course, reducing the deficit will not be easy. Making up for the [CARDINAL] lost jobs caused by this recession will not happen [TIME]. Not everything we have done over [DATE] has worked as quickly as we had hoped, and I am keenly aware that not all of our policies have been popular. So, no, our job is not easy. But you did not elect me to do what was easy. You did not elect me to just read the polls and figure how to keep myself in office. You did not elect me to avoid big problems. You elected me to do what was right. And as long as I am President, that is exactly what I intend to do. This country is emerging from an incredibly difficult period in its history -- an era of irresponsibility that stretched from Wall Street to [GPE], and had a devastating effect on a lot of people. We have started turning the corner on that era. But part of moving forward is returning to the time-honored values that built this country: hard work and self-reliance; responsibility for ourselves, but also responsibility for one another. It is about moving from an attitude that said What is in it for me? to one that asks, What is best for [GPE]? What is best for all our workers? What is best for all of our businesses? What is best for all of our children? These values are not [NORP] or [NORP]. They are not conservative or liberal values. They are [NORP] values. As [NORP], we take pride in what our party has accomplished over [DATE]: [ORG] and the minimum wage; the GI Bill and [ORG]; civil rights and worker's rights and women's rights. But we also recognize that throughout our history, there has been a noble [NORP] vision as well, of what this country can be. It was the vision of [PERSON], who set up the first land grant colleges and launched the transcontinental railroad; the vision of [PERSON], who used the power of government to break up monopolies; the vision of [PERSON], who helped build [ORG]. And, yes, the vision of [PERSON], who despite his aversion to government, was willing to help save [ORG] for future generations -- working with [NORP]. These were serious leaders for serious times. They were great politicians, but they did not spend all their time playing games or scoring points. They did not always prey on people's fears and anxieties. They made mistakes, but they did what they thought was in the best interests of their country and its people. And that is what the [NORP] people expect of us [DATE] -- [NORP], independents, and [NORP]. That is the debate they deserve. That is the leadership we owe them. I know that folks are worried about the future. I know there is still a lot of hurt out here. And when times are tough, I know it can be tempting to give in to cynicism and fear and doubt and division -- and just settle our sights a little bit lower, settle for something a little bit less. But that is not who we are, [GPE]. Those are not the values that built this country. We are here [DATE] because in the worst of times, the people who came before us brought out the best in [GPE]. Because our parents and our grandparents and our great-grandparents were willing to work and sacrifice for us. They were willing to take great risks, and face great hardship, and reach for a future that would give us the chance at a better life. They knew that this country is greater than the sum of its parts -- that [GPE] is not about the ambitions of any one individual, but the aspirations of an entire people, an entire nation. That is who we are. That is our legacy. And I am convinced that if we are willing to summon those values [DATE], and if we are willing to choose hope over fear, and choose the future over the past, and come together once more around the great project of national renewal, then we will restore our economy and rebuild our middle class and reclaim the [NORP] Dream for [DATE]. Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless [GPE].", "discourse_type": 0}

It is [DATE] to honor [PERSON], who unified [GPE], and to celebrate the rich culture and traditions of the [NORP] people. I chose [DATE] to come to the Senate Floor to talk about an issue of great importance to me and to my state: [NORP] Government Reorganization. It was a top priority of my immediate predecessors in this body - Senators [PERSON] and [PERSON]. For [DATE] they worked together in the [ORG] to advance priorities important to [GPE] and the nation. They made history at almost every step of their careers - securing [CARDINAL] of firsts in the [ORG] and [ORG]. But for the indigenous people of [GPE] - Senators [PERSON] and [PERSON] will be forever remembered for their work as members and then chairs of [ORG], and for their advocacy on behalf of [NORP], [NORP] and [NORP]. I want to acknowledge their legacy and to thank Senator [PERSON] for the role that he continues to play in the great State of [GPE] and in the [NORP] community in particular. And, here is the reason that I have chosen to carry forward this fight on behalf of [NORP]. Simply stated: because it is right to seek justice. [NORP] are the only federally recognized [NORP] people without a government-to-government relationship with [GPE] and they deserve access to the prevailing federal policy of self-determination. Opponents have argued that [NORP] are not [NORP] as if the word applies to [NORP] people of a certain racial or ethnic heritage or is limited to indigenous people from [CARDINAL] part of [GPE], but not another. This is misguided. In the U.S. Constitution, it is clear our Founding Fathers understood it was the tribal nations' sovereign authority that distinguished them from others. It was the fact that tribes were [NORP] groups with distinct governments that predated our own, that justified special treatment in the Constitution and under our federal laws. In what is now [GPE], [NORP] contact with [NORP] groups, began in [DATE] on the East Coast, and [DATE] on the West Coast; while in [GPE] and [GPE], [NORP] contact was delayed until [DATE]. Throughout [DATE] a myriad of factors influenced how various [NORP] groups were treated. The historical timeframe when policies and programs were applied to various [NORP] may have been different. But what was consistent throughout, were the federal policies and actions intended to strip [NORP] of their languages, weaken traditional leadership and family structures, divide land bases, prohibit religious and cultural practices, and break communal bonds. And, these policies were as harmful and unjust to [NORP] as they were to [NORP] and [NORP]. There was a thriving society that greeted Captain [PERSON] when he landed on the shores of [GPE] in [DATE]. Prior to their first contact with [NORP], [NORP] had a population of [CARDINAL]. They were a highly organized, self-sufficient society and they had their own rules, laws, language and culture. In his journals, [PERSON] referred to the indigenous people of [GPE] as [NORP] because it was the established English term in [DATE] to describe [NORP] -regardless of their race, ethnicity or their governmental structure. But, just like many [NORP] and [NORP] on the continent, the name [NORP] chose in their own language was -Kanaka Maoli - The People. From [DATE], [GPE] recognized the independence of [ORG] as a distinct political entity. We extended full and complete diplomatic recognition, and entered into [CARDINAL] treaties and conventions with the [NORP] monarchs to govern commerce and navigation. These treaties are clear evidence that [NORP] were considered a separate and distinct nation [DATE] after contact. But, on [DATE], the legitimate government of the [NORP] people was removed forcibly, by agents and armed forces of [GPE]. The illegality of this action has been acknowledged in contemporary as well as modern times by both the Executive and Legislative branches of our federal government. An investigation called for by President [PERSON] produced a report by former Congressman [PERSON]. The report's findings were unambiguous: [GPE] diplomatic and military representatives had abused their authority and were responsible for the change in the government. As a result of these findings, the [GPE] Minister to [GPE] was recalled from his diplomatic post and the military commander of the [GPE] armed forces stationed in [GPE] was disciplined and forced to resign his commission. In a message to [ORG] in [DATE], President [PERSON] described the events that brought down [ORG] as an act of war, committed with the participation of a diplomatic representative of [GPE] and without authority of [ORG]. And, he acknowledged that by such acts, the government of a peaceful and friendly people was overthrown. President [PERSON] concluded that a substantial wrong has thus been done which a due regard for our national character -as well as the rights of the injured people - requires we should endeavor to repair and he called for the restoration of the [NORP] monarchy. [ORG] refused to relinquish power and in [DATE], declared itself to be [GPE]. TheProvisional Government advocated annexation of [GPE] to [GPE] and began to lobby the [ORG] to pass a treaty of annexation. [GPE]'s monarch at the time, Queen [PERSON], presented a petition to the Chairman of [ORG] and a formal statement of protest to the Secretary of [ORG]. The petition, signed by [CARDINAL] 000 [NORP] men and women, represented [CARDINAL] of the [NORP] census population and was compiled in [DATE]. It also included the signatures of [CARDINAL] 000 [NORP] who supported the return of the islands to self-governed rule. The Petition Against Annexation was a powerful tool in the defeat of the annexation treaty in [DATE]. In [DATE], however, proponents of annexation introduced the Newlands Joint Resolution, a measure requiring only a simple majority of votes to gain passage. The annexation of [GPE] passed with the much reduced threshold of votes, and was signed into law by President [PERSON] in [DATE]. For [DATE] after the founding of our nation, federal policies of removal, relocation, assimilation and termination, decimated [NORP] communities and worsened the socio-economic conditions for [NORP], [NORP] and [NORP]. The policy of banning [NORP] use in the schools was adopted by the territory of [GPE]. Native children were punished for speaking Hawaiian, just as [NORP] and [NORP] were punished for using their own languages in school. The policy of allotting parcels of land to individual [NORP] began in [DATE], as a way to break up the reservations and communal lifestyles. In [DATE], it was expanded to include [NORP]. In [DATE], it was applied to [NORP]. In an attempt to reverse the damage done by these policies, since [DATE], the [ORG] has established special [NORP] programs in education, employment, health care and housing. And, the [ORG] has extended to [NORP] many of the same rights and privileges accorded to [NORP] and [NORP]. The [ORG] has consistently recognized [NORP] as native peoples of [GPE] on whose behalf it may exercise its powers under the Constitution. In [DATE], the [ORG] passed, and President [PERSON] signed, legislation known as the Apology Resolution - a formal acknowledgement and apology by the [ORG]. This legislation recognizes that the overthrow of the [NORP] government resulted in the suppression of the inherent sovereignty of the [NORP] people and the deprivation of the rights of [NORP] to self-determination. It has been [DATE] since the passage of the Apology Resolution, but the federal government has not yet acted to provide a process for reorganizing a [NORP] governing entity. This inaction puts [NORP] at a unique disadvantage. Of the [CARDINAL] major groups of [NORP] in [GPE] - [NORP], [NORP], and [NORP] -only [NORP] currently lack the benefits of democratic self-government. An extensive [ORG] legislative and oversight record created over [DATE], and [CARDINAL] of [ORG] findings delineated in federal statutes establish these facts: [NORP], like tribes on the continental [GPE], formed a Native community with their own government; this political entity existed before the founding of [GPE]; and, [NORP] share historical and current bonds within their community. Like tribes in the continental [GPE], [NORP], have certain lands set aside for their benefit pursuant to Acts of Congress, including: [QUANTITY] of Hawaiian Homes Commission Act land and share an interest in the income generated by [QUANTITY] of public trust lands under the Hawaii Admission Act. Although the [ORG] has passed [CARDINAL] statutes to try to address some of the negative effects of earlier federal actions and policies, data reveal persistent health, education and income disparities. [NORP] experience disproportionately high rates of unemployment and incarceration; and, [NORP] children are over represented in the juvenile justice system. [NORP] families rank last in the nation in average [DATE] pay and face the highest rates of homelessness. Separate is not equal, and that is why I urge the federal government to treat [NORP] fairly. It is long past time for the [NORP] people to regain their right to self-governance. [DATE] [GPE] passed a historic measure to explicitly acknowledge that [NORP] are the only indigenous, aboriginal, maoli population of [GPE] and to establish [ORG]. My good friend and the former Governor of [GPE], [PERSON], was appointed Chairman and is leading the effort to register [NORP]. This landmark effort is widely supported by [GPE], our [ORG] delegation and our citizens. I want to acknowledge the Commission, commend its vital work, and urge [NORP] to take advantage of this opportunity to help reorganize a representational government. The actions and commitments of [GPE] and [ORG] are crucial. But, in order to reach our goal - we must all work together. That is why [DATE] - on King Kamehameha Day - I call upon all of us to join in the fight for justice for [NORP]. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "bennetsenategovpublicindexcfm20221bennetspeaksonthesenatefloorontheanniversaryofthejanuary6thattackontheuscapitol", "text": "I feel grateful to have the chance here to join my colleagues to mark the anniversary of [DATE]. And I thank the Chair of [ORG], Senator [PERSON], for her leadership in all of this. We had an insurrection here [DATE] that could have very easily turned into a conflagration if it had not been for the incredible bravery of [ORG] and the other law enforcement that was summoned to the [FAC], too late, but nevertheless, here. [ORG], as my colleague from [GPE] was talking about, they kept this place from being burned down. They kept people from getting killed. They lost their lives on [DATE] and in [DATE] because of the trauma that they were exposed to. They suffered racial epithets that nobody in [GPE] should have to suffer shouted in the halls of this [FAC]. T-shirts with the most racist, Holocaust denying slogans on them. And there are people here, as my colleague from [GPE] said, who are claiming that they were acting like tourists. That is a really big lie too. This was an incredibly dangerous situation. And we were saved. Not just us, but the staff all over this [FAC] and everybody else. I just heard somebody downstairs in the basement walking by and they were pointing out [CARDINAL] of those pictures that is down there of newsboys standing in front of the [ORG] when they were kids. And the guy said, Those were my great uncles. Because this place, for the people that work here -- I am not talking about the [ORG], but the people that work here that are the staff, whose grandparents worked here, whose great uncles are on the pictures downstairs. To them, this is a family. And it was attacked. It was assaulted on behalf of people that came summoned here by the president who claimed that the election had been stolen from him, who was perpetrating a big lie about what had happened in the election. There should not have even been a surprise about the results in the election. There was little reason for suspense. And it is tragic that [DATE], we still have to come here and say, [PERSON] won the election. And he did by any fair study of what happened [DATE] on [DATE]. He won [GPE] by [CARDINAL] 000 votes. He won [GPE] by [CARDINAL] 000 votes. He won [GPE] by [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] votes. He won [GPE] by [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] votes, in [GPE] by [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] votes. In every one of those swing states, he won by more votes than [PERSON] won in his election against [PERSON]. So this was not some razor thin margin. This margin was bigger in those states, except [GPE], than the margin that [PERSON] had won when he won the election against [PERSON]. [PERSON] won this election by [CARDINAL] votes. [PERSON] actually lost the popular vote when he won the election by [CARDINAL] votes. But his election was not seriously contended by anybody. And it should not have been, because he'd won [ORG]. Just as [PERSON] had won [ORG]. And he still claims the election was stolen even though there is no evidence that that is true. His own Attorney General said it is a lie. His lawyers -- [PERSON] lawyers -- have been thrown out of [CARDINAL] courtrooms by state and federal judges, some of them appointed by President [PERSON] himself, saying that there was no evidence that there was fraud. [DATE], there is been another incredibly expensive audit or review of the election, this time the election in [GPE]. And you know what, there were [CARDINAL] people down there who were dead who voted. [CARDINAL] people. They did not actually vote, they were dead, but people cast ballots on behalf of them. [CARDINAL] people out of [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] of those cast a vote for [PERSON]. But President [PERSON] continues to say that there were dead people voting all over [GPE]. [ORG] did a review of all those swing states that I was mentioning earlier, and they found that if you just looked at the disputed ballots -- so these are not even fraudulent ballots, because they have not been identified as fraudulent, they are just disputed ballots -- that in all these cases, the disputed ballots came to [PERCENT] of the margin in any [CARDINAL] of these races. In other words, in not a single [CARDINAL] of these swing states where there is a dispute that President [PERSON] has brought, would it make a material difference, even if it were true, what you are alleging. Which it is not. And he is still doubled down on the big lie. And the result of that is, as my colleagues have said here [DATE], there are [CARDINAL] bills nationwide, in the name of that big lie, making it harder for the [NORP] people to vote, making it harder for them to register, making it harder for people to vote early, or to vote by mail. Because of a myth. Because of a lie, slashing the number of polling places, and dropboxes. In [GPE], they are down to [CARDINAL] dropbox per county. In [GPE], I can practically cross my street and vote at a dropbox. This is an effort to subvert elections to cling to power. That is what is happening here. And it is based on a massive falsehood -- the big lie. I think one needs to ask oneself, even people that support President [PERSON], what future does the stop the steal movement imagine for our country? What future do they imagine for this democracy where every election is going to be contested? Where political violence replaces the ballot box. Where elections are decided by strongmen, not votes, turning us into [GPE] or [GPE]. Is that really what we want our legacy to be here in the country? Do we want to be the first generation of [NORP] to decide that it is just too hard to do our duty to the people that founded this country, the people that fought from the time this country was founded until [DATE], who died for the sake of democracy, that it is just too hard? That somehow our differences are unique, or so important that we are going to give up on our shared commitment to the democracy in favor of those disagreements? And I think we need to ask ourselves at a moment like this, what we owe the generations of [NORP] that have fought to make this country more democratic, more fair, and more free. What do we owe the [CARDINAL] [NORP] -- a record -- who showed up during a plague, this COVID pandemic, to cast their votes for [PERSON] and for [PERSON] -- what are they owed? And what do we owe our kids and our grandkids? I think the answer is very clear, which is a stronger democracy, an economy that works for everybody, not just the people at the very top. And where do we begin? You know, [GPE], I think, is a great example, Mr. President, where we have made it a lot easier for people to vote. We have one of the highest voter turnouts in the country. I always have to say, especially when the senator from [GPE] is around, that we are number [CARDINAL] in terms of voter turnout, [GPE] is number [CARDINAL], but we are coming for you. And that is the spirit we should all have. We should be trying to get more people to vote, not fewer people to vote. We should have vote by mail, we should have early balloting. We have all of that in [GPE], one of the highest turnout rates in the country, and no fraud. No fraud. So I am going to just finish by saying that we should distrust politicians who cannot seem to win people's votes with their argument, just as we should distrust politicians who attack the free press to avoid accountability even though that free press is enshrined in our Constitution. And we should recommit to each other and the democracy. Let me tell you something, Mr. President. [DATE] we had another tragedy in [GPE], another disaster. [GPE], [GPE] started out [DATE] with a mass shooting in a grocery store, some of you may remember that. And basically on [DATE], we had a massive fire that ripped through neighborhoods in the front range of [GPE] in [GPE]. [CARDINAL] people, [CARDINAL] houses were burned, [CARDINAL] 000 people [forced from] their homes. And I sat there thinking to myself as I was with my daughters watching those fires on the television set, how much we actually need each other, you know. And there is a lot of evidence out there in [DATE] -the law enforcement that got those [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] people out and had almost literally no fatalities because of what they did and what they sacrificed. The [NORP] that stepped up [TIME] and said You can come to my house, we will put you up in my house so that out of those [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] people, there were [CARDINAL] people in a shelter that night. The reporters, the journalists, that were out there long into the night, reporting on that fire so that people might have some sense of whether their house had been lost or their house had been saved. The local county officials who have worked tirelessly after flood and after fire, and after natural disasters to come together to make sure that we build back stronger, which we always do in [GPE]. And even, let me say, the federal government's contribution, [ORG], because if there is [CARDINAL] reason that we should be [CARDINAL] nation under God, it is for a natural disaster like the one that is just occurred in [GPE]. This is our choice. We either save this democracy, which I believe we will, or we let it go. And it is going to be on us. And if we let it go, generations of [NORP] are going to indict us for that. And if we save it, I think they will celebrate the work that we did here just as we celebrate the work of the people that came before us that made our country more democratic, more fair, and more free. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.", "discourse_type": 0}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingprincipaldeputypresssecretarysarahsanders", "text": "[INTERVIEWED], I think it would be helpful to establish some of the facts, I have a couple broader questions for you. So, number one, yes or no, did the President direct [PERSON] to write this memo on [PERSON]? No, the President had lost -- again, like I said, he'd lost confidence in Director [PERSON], and, frankly, he'd been considering letting Director [PERSON] go since [DATE] he was elected. But he did have a conversation with the Deputy Attorney General on [DATE], where they had come to him to express their concerns. The President asked they put those concerns and their recommendation in writing, which is the letter that you guys have received. So it is [ORG] assertion that [PERSON] decided on his own, after being confirmed, to review [PERSON]'s performance? Absolutely. And I think most of [GPE] had decided on their own that Director [PERSON] was not the person that should be leading the [ORG], as evidenced by the numerous comments that we have seen from [NORP] members in the [ORG] and [ORG], [NORP] members, members of the [ORG], and people across the board. Since we are establishing the facts -- Senator [PERSON] said she was told something different directly from the President. The President said he asked [PERSON] and [PERSON] to review this. Is she lying? He asked them for their recommendation, based on the conversation that they had on [DATE]. He asked them to put that recommendation in writing. But they came to him on his own. And again, the President had lost confidence in [PERSON] from [DATE] he was elected. He was not sure that he should be -- Then why did [PERSON] say he did? On [DATE], [PERSON] came out and said that the President had full confidence in his [ORG] Director? Why did he say that? Look, I think -- again, he is questioned Director [PERSON]'s reason for needing to stay at the [ORG]. He had countless conversations with members from within the [ORG]. I think [CARDINAL] of the big catalysts that we saw was, [DATE], on [DATE], Director [PERSON] made a pretty startling revelation that he had essentially taken a stick of dynamite and thrown it into [ORG] by going around the chain of command when he decided to take steps without talking to the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General when holding a press conference and telling them that he would not let them know what he was going to say -- Then why did the President -- -- and that is simply not allowed. And somebody like the Deputy Attorney General, [PERSON] -- who everybody across the board has unequivocally said, this guy is a man of upstanding character and essentially the gold standard at [ORG] -- when you take an action like that, when you go around the chain of command in [ORG], then you have to make steps and take action to make a recommendation to the President. And that is what he did. -- [NORP] say that they -- -- [NORP] investigation, [INTERVIEWED]? Does it have to do with the investigation into [GPE]? How do you respond to those criticisms? [PERSON], go ahead. We will come back to that, I am sure. Until you said from the podium just now that the President lost confidence in him over [DATE] and [DATE], we had thought that this was all [PERSON]'s doing. When was it that the President lost confidence in [PERSON]? What was the tipping point? I think it is been an erosion of confidence. I think that Director [PERSON] has shown over [DATE] and, frankly, [DATE], a lot of missteps and mistakes. And certainly I think that, as you have seen from many of the comments from [NORP] members, including Senator [PERSON], they did not think he should be there, they thought he should be gone. Frankly, I think it is startling that [NORP] are not celebrating this since they have been calling for it for so long. Well, hang on -- Oh, a follow-up. Do not forget, and I have another one I need to ask you, too. I think there is a [CARDINAL]-question limit around here. To follow on that, you said that he made a lot of missteps and mistakes. Back at [DATE], this President was applauding the [ORG] Director when he reopened the investigation into [PERSON] emails. So he seemed quite happy with him at that point. What changed? Well, I think the President's position. [CARDINAL] he was a candidate for President, not the President. Those are [CARDINAL] very different things. Once you take over leading [ORG] that is very different than being a candidate in a campaign. As you guys all know, there is a very clear distinction between those [CARDINAL] things. I think also having a letter like the one that he received and having that conversation that outlined the basic just atrocities in circumventing the chain of command in [ORG]. Any person of legal mind in authority knows what a big deal that is, particularly in [ORG], particularly for somebody like the Deputy Attorney General, who has been part of [ORG] for [DATE] and is such a respected person -- when he saw that, he had to speak up on that action, and I think that was the final catalyst. And just a real quick question on the meetings [TIME]. The President is accused by [NORP] of trying to circumvent the [GPE] investigation by firing [PERSON]; he meets with the [NORP] Foreign Minister and the [NORP] Ambassador to [GPE]. He is accused of being [NORP]; he meets with [PERSON] Secretary of [ORG]. The timing of all of this, is it just ironic or is this the President poking a finger in his critic's eye? Look, these were meetings that have been on the books for a while. They did not just happen [TIME]. There is not a strategy to go after the [NORP] on this. I think, frankly, the saddest thing is that the [NORP] are trying to politicize and take away from something that the President should be doing. He should be meeting with the Foreign Minister. He should be meeting with people like [PERSON]. And for them to try to attack him for doing his job, -- maybe they should spent a little more time doing their jobs, and we would not have all the problems that we do. [INTERVIEWED], is not it true that the President had already decided to fire [PERSON], and he asked [ORG] to put together the rationale for that firing? No. When did he make the decision? He made the decision for -- the final decision to move forward with it was [DATE]. But I know that he is been contemplating it for a while. But how do you explain what [PERSON] says, that the President told her that he was concerned with the mess at the [ORG] and asked [ORG] to look into it? I cannot speak for Senator [PERSON], but I did speak directly to the President and heard directly from him that he, again, had been considering letting Director [PERSON] go pretty much since [DATE] he took office, but that there was no request by him to have a review at [ORG]. But was the reason for the firing what was written by the Deputy Attorney General? Is that why he did it? That was, I think, the final piece that moved the President to make that quick and decisive action [DATE]. What did he mean in the letter that he wrote informing [PERSON] that he was being fired -- he said, on [CARDINAL] separate occasions [PERSON] had told him that I am not under investigation. What were those [CARDINAL] occasions that the [ORG] Director told the President that he was not under investigation? I am not going to get into the specifics of their conversations, but I can tell you that Director [PERSON] relayed that information to the President. Following up on that, [INTERVIEWED], did the President ask Direct [PERSON] whether he was under investigation when they were -- when they had these meetings? Again, I am not going to go into the specifics of their conversations. Is [ORG] concerned that -- he obviously made a decision to stick that in the letter and to make that public. Are there any concerns that it was inappropriate that they had that type of a conversation? No. How important was the [ORG] Director's failure to stop the leaks coming out of the [ORG] to the President? How important was that? I think that is probably one of the many factors. You cannot deny somebody -- that that was not a problem. And so I think that was just another one of the many reasons that he no longer had the confidence of the President or the rest of the [ORG]. Can we expect more firings from [ORG]? Not that I am aware of [DATE]. Going forward, does the President want [ORG] to shut down what he is called a taxpayer-funded charade investigation? He wants them to continue with whatever they see appropriate and sees fit, just the same as he is encouraged the [ORG] and [ORG] committees to continue any ongoing investigations. Look, the bottom line is any investigation that was happening on [DATE] is still happening [DATE]. That has not changed. And, in fact, we encourage them to complete this investigation so we can put it behind us and we can continue to see exactly what we have been saying for [DATE], there is no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and [GPE]. And we'd love for that to be completed so that we can all move on and focus on the things that, frankly, I think most of [NORP] are concerned with. Even if they keep on wasting taxpayer money, he wants it to continue? Look, nobody wants to waste taxpayer money. I think the President has made a priority of this. That is another reason we'd love for it to come to completion. But at the same time, I know that you all will not let this go until it does. And so we'd love for that to be completed. Let us put it behind us. Let us move on, and let us focus on what we need to do to turn our country around. [INTERVIEWED], [CARDINAL] questions. [CARDINAL], was [ORG] aware at the time of this decision and announcement that grand jury subpoenas in the case of [PERSON] had just gone out? No, nor would we -- should we have been. Do you know anything about that process? No, I do not . I'd have to refer you to -- And does [ORG] believe that if these [ORG] investigations are going to proceed in these allegations of [NORP] interference, do you support continued funding, and support who to lead that investigation? Who is going to be running that right now? Are you confident that that could be [PERSON], or does it have to be somebody else? Right now I believe that would fall to the Deputy Attorney General, [PERSON]. And we are incredibly confident in his abilities, as I believe you can tell by the rest of the [ORG], including many [NORP], are as well. Given the fact that he was confirmed [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL] and had overwhelming praise from both sides of the aisle, I think there is complete confidence in him. And another reason, frankly, for Director [PERSON] to be out of the way so that they can have somebody leading this effort that everybody across the board has respect and confidence in. Nobody wants this to be finished and completed more than us so that we can focus on what we need to do here. [INTERVIEWED], the President said -- or excuse me -- [PERSON] said [DATE] the President has confidence in the Director. So, again, I am sorry for not understanding this, but what has happened in [DATE] to shake the confidence? Was [PERSON] lying at that point? Or did something happen in [DATE]? Of course, you'd love to add that in. But certainly not. Again, I think one of the big things that took place was the process in the hearing on [DATE] where, again -- not to sound like a broken record, but since you guys keep asking the same questions, I guess it is only fair that I keep giving the same answers -- but you have somebody, the Director of the [ORG], who reports to the Deputy Attorney General, going around the chain of command. That is simply not okay. That is not something that is allowed in the justice system, nor should it be. That is a huge problem. That, along with the corrections that had to take place over [TIME] I believe, [TIME], those are all big problems and another, I think, kind of final piece that pushed the President to make the decision that he did. Does he regret not doing it earlier, like on [DATE] or [DATE]? No, I believe the President wanted to give Director [PERSON] a chance, but he feels that he made the right decision, certainly. Why did he do as he did it, if I could ask? Why did he have [CARDINAL] of his long-time security advisors hand-deliver a letter to the [ORG] when the [ORG] Director was, in fact, in [GPE]? Did not he deserve a phone call or a face-to-face conversation? Why did he decide to do it like that? He followed the proper protocol in that process, which is a handwritten notification. And at the same time, no matter how you fire someone, it is never an easy process, and so he felt like following protocol was the best thing to do. Does he plan to speak to him? I am not aware of that conversation. Was the President aware that [PERSON] asked for more resources in the [GPE] investigation? And did that factor into his decision to get rid of Mr. [PERSON], the Director? Not that I am aware of, and I think that would be a better question for [ORG]. Can I ask a follow-up? On the campaign trail, President [PERSON] frequently said lock her up, and he criticized [ORG] for not being harsh enough on [PERSON]. He actually praised Director [PERSON] in [DATE] for having the guts to reopen the investigation. Why was he moved by a letter that said that Director [PERSON] was, if anything, too harsh on [PERSON]? Why does that move the President to fire him? Again, I think you are looking at [CARDINAL] very different positions. The President was wearing a different hat at that time. He was a candidate -- not the President. Those circumstances certainly change when you become the President. And again, when you go around the chain of command in [ORG], when you, like I said before, throw a stick of dynamite into [ORG], that is a big problem and it is one that cannot be ignored. But he already knew that, did not he, [INTERVIEWED]? He already knew what Mr. [PERSON] had done. I think that this was -- my understanding is [DATE] was the first time the Director had openly and publicly made that statement and made that clear. The statement [DATE] on the President's meeting with Foreign Minister [PERSON] did not include anything on the reported incidents of violence in [GPE] against people in the LGBT community. Is the reason why that was not included in the readout is because the President is not informed on the issue? I am sorry? Could you speak up a little bit? Sure. Is the reason why that was not included in the readout is because the President is not informed about the reports of anti-gay violence in [GPE]? Look, I mean a lot of times there are parts of the conversation that are not specifically included in a readout. But I am not aware -- I have not had that conversation, so I do not know. I was not part of that meeting, so I cannot speak to every detail. And I'd have to refer you to the readout on the specifics of what I know was discussed. Has the President been briefed on this issue generally? Was [GPE] -- Has the President been briefed on this issue generally? That is something I will have to get back to you on. I am not [PERCENT] sure. You said you want the [GPE] investigation to continue at [ORG]. Would [ORG] oppose the appointment of a special prosecutor to continue to look into -- to continue the investigation? We do not think it is necessary. You have got a [ORG] committee, a [ORG] committee, and [ORG] all working on this. I do not think that there is a necessary need at this point to add that. You have got the Deputy Attorney General, who I would say is about as independent as it comes due to the fact that he has such bipartisan support. What gives you such confidence that the rank and file within the [ORG] lost faith in the [ORG] Director? There is a special agent who is inside, who wrote us, who said: The vast majority of the [ORG] is in favor of Director [PERSON]. This is a total shock. This is not supposed to happen. The real losers here are [CARDINAL] front-line people in the organization because they lost the only guy working here in [DATE] who actually cared about them. So what is your response to these rank-and-file [ORG] agents who disagree with your contention that they lost faith in Director [PERSON]? Look, we have heard from countless members of the [ORG] that say very different things. In fact, the President will be meeting with Acting Director [PERSON] [TIME] to discuss that very thing -- the morale at the [ORG] -- as well as make an offer to go directly to the [ORG] if he feels that that is necessary and appropriate. And we will certainly provide further information on that meeting for you guys. The organization that represents [ORG] agents is asking for a voice in the selection process of Mr. [PERSON]'s successor. Is that something the President supports? I have not had that conversation, but I know, at this point, it is being run through [ORG]. And so I would refer you to them on what that process looks like at this point in time. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED]. Who did the President consult before making the final decision to fire [PERSON]? The President spoke with a number of individuals, but at the end of the day, it was the President's decision. And in between [DATE] night and [DATE], when he decided to fire the [ORG] Director, did he speak again with the Deputy Attorney General or the Attorney General? I know that they spoke on [DATE], and I believe the next follow-up was actually in writing. They may have spoken, as well, but I'd have to double-check. Just to be clear, so is it accurate to pull away from the information that we have that [DATE] [TIME] the President made the final call, said I want this in writing as a recommendation, and then took that recommendation as the evidence that he wanted to provide to fire [PERSON]? My understanding is the decision was actually made on [DATE], but the first conversation that he had was on [DATE], when there was an oral recommendation made, and the President requested that he see that in writing to review it further. [INTERVIEWED], thank you. You say you want to move on and focus on the thing that [NORP] care about. So let me ask you about that. You are somewhat halfway home on healthcare. You still have tax reform to do, a spending bill, debt ceiling, and infrastructure. That is just a handful. Pretty big list. Pretty big list, right? But what happened [DATE], you could argue, just widened the divide and made [GPE] politics more toxic. So how do you go about accomplishing all of those things with, now, the heightened political environment that we are in? Frankly, I am surprised that it did create a divide since you have had so many [NORP] and [NORP] repeatedly calling for Director [PERSON] to be gone. Frankly, I do not think it matters what this President says, you are going to have [NORP] come out and fight him every single step of the way. I think that is one of the things that is wrong with [GPE], and I think that is one of the reasons that we have got to get back to focusing on those issues and, frankly, draining the swamp a little bit further. Was he surprised by the [NORP] backlash? Did he anticipate it, considering some of the past statements? How could he have, considering the fact that most of the people that are declaring war [DATE] were the very ones that were begging for Director [PERSON] to be fired? If [PERSON] had won the election -- which, thank God, she did not -- but if she had, and she had been in the same position, she would have fired [PERSON] immediately, and the very [NORP] that are criticizing the President [DATE] would be dancing in the streets celebrating. So it is just the -- I think, the purest form of hypocrisy. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED]. [CARDINAL] questions. [CARDINAL], there is a report in [GPE] that indicates the President has made a decision not to move the [GPE] embassy from [GPE] to [GPE]. Can you confirm that? Has he made a decision on that? The President has not made a decision yet, and is still reviewing that. Also, President [PERSON], in his speech, I think, [TIME], warned the President against moving the embassy to [GPE]. Does that warning and warning from other [NORP] leaders play into his decision as he is considering this move? I am not going to get into the decision-making process here. All I can tell you is that he is still reviewing it, and as soon as we have a decision, I know we will be happy to report back to you guys. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED]. [CARDINAL] questions, both related to the selection of a successor to Director [PERSON]. When President [PERSON] chose a [ORG] director, he had a blue ribbon panel advising him. Presidents [PERSON] and [PERSON] interviewed several candidates. Is the President going to follow this pattern, or does he have some individual in mind at this point? Right now, I know that there are several individuals being considered, and the first step will be determining the acting -- or, excuse me, the interim director. And that is being handled through [ORG], and I would refer you to them for right now. And the other question I was going to ask was -- Oh, yeah, I forgot you have got [CARDINAL]. I have got [CARDINAL]. I am pretty nice, [PERSON], are not I? [PERSON]? [PERSON]. But that is okay. He does not get a question anymore. It is a [NORP] baby. Who is [PERSON]? Her daughter. Who is had a birthday. Just want to make sure we got that in again. Happy birthday, [PERSON]. [PERSON]! Gone with the Wind, come on, [PERSON]. I was going to say it is a fact that [ORG] generally prefer people who have been agents themselves or have a background in the [ORG]. [CARDINAL] former agents have been director in [DATE]. Will the President consider current or former agents for the position? I would say that he is not ruling anything out at this point. But again, as of [DATE], [ORG] is handling the first step in this process. Should the Attorney General, who has recused himself from the [GPE] investigation, have any role in the selection of a successor? And given the fact that in his [DATE] interviews, the President himself said he had confidence in Director [PERSON], at this podium the [NORP] people were told he had confidence in Director [PERSON], can people take at face value what the President says about personnel issues like this, or his views on things, if [DATE], he is out? Absolutely, you can take full confidence in the words of the President. In terms of whether or not Attorney General [PERSON] should have a role -- look, the [ORG] is doing a whole lot more than the [GPE] investigation. I know everybody in this room and probably most of the media around the world would like to think that is the [ORG]'s sole responsibility, but that is probably [CARDINAL] of the smallest things that they have got going on their plate, and the [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] employees that work there. And so he should absolutely have a role in seeing who runs that agency and that department. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED]. Does the President have confidence in the Acting Director? Yes, he does. Okay. And secondly, you mentioned earlier that you are encouraging the [ORG] to move on from the investigation. Is it appropriate for [ORG] to be directing the [ORG] what to do with any investigation they are currently investigating? I do not think that that was the nature or the intent of my comment, was not to direct the [ORG], but I think it is simply -- we are fully compliant with helping this process move along. We'd like to see it completed so that, frankly, all of us can move on and focus on things that [PERSON] listed earlier, like tax reform, like healthcare, like infrastructure. Those are big programs, big priorities for this administration. And, frankly, what we'd like to be the [CARDINAL] thing that we are talking about here, [DATE], [DATE], is not [ORG] investigations but things that, frankly, affect [NORP] voters and [NORP] taxpayers [DATE]. What exactly precipitated the [DATE] meeting? Was that because of the hearing [DATE] and what he said there? Or did the [DATE] meeting that the President had with the [ORG] officials come out of a longer process of consideration of [PERSON]? The [ORG] officials were here for other business, not specifically to meet with the President on that. The topic came up, and they asked to speak with the President, and that is how it moved forward. Did the President previously talk to Attorney General [PERSON] or Deputy Attorney [PERSON] about the possibility of going this way with [PERSON]? Not that I am aware of, no. Did it come up in the discussion process before the confirmation that the President was considering nominating [PERSON] -- did he talk about [PERSON] with [PERSON] then? No, not that I am aware of. The President's statement that he talked to [PERSON] about whether or not he was being investigated raises several questions. Can you talk about why you are not willing to add any more to that about who asked for that and why that was discussed? Who asked for what? I am sorry. About whether or not -- I mean, the President seems to be trying to exonerate himself in this. I mean, can you talk about why you will not add anymore to what that conversation was, how that took place, when it took place -- The [CARDINAL] occasions -- could you clarify those [CARDINAL] occasions and who initiated? Again, I am not going to get into the specific details. I will check and see if we have follow-up on that. But at this point, I am not going to comment any further than what was spelled out in the letter. Why was it in the letter? If you do not want to clarify or comment, why was it put in the letter in the first place? Look, I think it was something that is far above my pay grade -- was decided to be included. And again, I am not going to get into the specifics of that. Thanks, guys, so much.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "pelosihousegovnewspressreleasestranscriptofpelosipressconferencetoday93", "text": "[INTERVIEWED], it looks like the terrorists in [GPE] have been planning this for [DATE]. What does that say about the [GPE] ability to interdict and intercept people with bad intents like this? Well, we had a briefing [DATE], and we had some more questions about that. I do not think we have heard the whole story yet. Our responsibility is to protect the [NORP] people any way that we can. We also have to protect our civil liberties in our country, and we have to keep that balance. But according to what we heard, it would have been very hard to - we will see. We have to learn more, but from what we heard [DATE] - was that [DATE] when we had the briefing? Time has gone by. It would've been very hard to detect. Still - do you feel let down? Well, this is an unfolding case and revelation. We will see what else is there. [INTERVIEWED], have [NORP] responded to your call to get rid of the Dickey Amendment in the omnibus? And if that is not removed from the omnibus, will [NORP] be able to reach a deal? Well, I think of it more as an incentive for [NORP] to vote for the bill. This is, after all, a compromise. And we know we have a responsibility to keep government open, and that is what we are striving to do, in spite of some of the bad riders that are still in the bill from [DATE] gone by that have, shall we say, ossified within the process. But I think it is a gift to them to say, 'You want our votes? Here is a way to get them.' I think of it more in the positive. [INTERVIEWED]? Yes, [PERSON]. Are you going to ask about the [ORG]? Actually, I was not . I thought you were going to ask me - you know, the [ORG] and the [ORG] play in [DATE]. You know, the [ORG]. You know which team is the much better, right? Yeah, yeah. See? When the [ORG] are winning all of these games straight, he does not want to talk about it. We do not have a basketball team in [GPE]. So But we have one - [ORG]. And we are very proud of [PERSON]. But they play in [GPE]. Yeah, but that is the San Francisco Bay area. And they are coming So, back to my question, the Speaker has said that they are considering - they are working on the tax extenders bill and the omnibus side by side. Is there a possibility, if you get trade-offs - if they do in fact cleave these bills apart and they are separate pieces - if you get something in tax extenders, in Child Credit [Tax] or you get guns here - that that is considered this macro sense because What is the question? That if the negotiation is being worked out that way - that you are looking at these [CARDINAL] pieces of legislation side by side and it is not horse-trading on just one bill, horse-trading on the other because then they - because they want to get as many [NORP] as possible So, the question is? The question is - is that how the negotiations are working? That if you get something in tax extenders, they get something in the omnibus, and vice versa? Well, we will see how it goes. I thought you were going to say if they joined them together - so let me anticipate that. I would not vote for it. I would not recommend that anybody else vote for it. So that is not a way to keep government open, unless they have all of the [NORP] votes to do it. But they obviously want to get as many [NORP] as they can for the omnibus. You guys have said consistently that it looks like they are going to be Ok, but you have already had your question. Next? [INTERVIEWED], I am wondering if it is starting to look unlikely that you can get a big deal on extenders and perhaps you will end up with just a [DATE] extension? No, they could have a [NORP] extender bill. I am only speaking for the [ORG] [NORP]. And when they say, 'Oh, I am holding up the extender bill, ' I have never been for it, I was not for it before it had Big Oil in it. I think it is far too expensive. I think the extender bill that is out there - as I said - is destructive of our future. It is the wrong way to go, to have [MONEY], maybe [MONEY] in permanent tax extenders. There is no reason we have to go down that path. And yes, there are a couple good things in there about Child Tax Credit and the rest. I negotiated those - as I said before - with President [PERSON]. It was historic - the levels to which we took that. But, it is time to have indexation for that. They do not want to hear about that. So, from my stand point - and some of my Members even think, with extenders - indexation in it, they would not be for the bill because it is too big. It undermines our ability to get something done for the future. So, as I said to Senator [PERSON] - you are either saying, 'I am holding it up or I am not in the loop. I cannot be both, but, I do not even want to be in the loop on that bill.' And then, to add the ban - lifting the ban on the oil and all the money that means for the oil industry - while they cannot index for children - it is just too big, it is unfair, and it does not have support of [ORG] [NORP]. But, it could have the support of others. I am not speaking for anyone except [ORG] [NORP]. This is going to be the last question. [INTERVIEWED], some of the budget-watch groups have said that if this extender package goes through, this [NORP]-controlled [ORG] will add [MONEY] to the debt. Are [NORP] being dishonest? And to that matter, [ORG] as well? How much deficit control has been going on [DATE]? Well, I am not saying anyone's being dishonest. I am just saying they have a different view of what adds to the deficit. What I do know is a stimulus to the economy is to invest in Child Tax Credit, earned income tax credit because people spend that money immediately. It injects money into the economy. But then, if you review the list of some of the things that they have - and some of them are not - I mean, [CARDINAL], small businesses - we created that. But you should not be having it permanent and unpaid for. That is the issue. It is not the issue of - now, some of them are terrible, and they are permanent and unpaid for. So, they have no justification. Others of them - okay, if we are going to have to. We have to pay for 9/11. What is that? [MONEY]. We have to find the money to pay for 9/11, for the health and the compensation of people who - in an emergency, so that should make it not have to be paid for - in an emergency, risked their lives, have consequences, health and otherwise - that we owe them this compensation. We have to find the money to pay for that, but [MONEY] permanent, unpaid-for tax breaks - I mean, I am glad to hear you say that there are some people who are concerned about the budget because I have not heard many of them speak up. But, this is not the right way to go. But, they have the majority, and this is their vehicle. And so, there are some negotiation going on with them on it, and I am not part of that because I do not believe in it. I think it is the wrong way to go. My Members share that view. By the way, my Members are the most vocal on this because I listen to what they have to say. I notify them of what I hear. I do not tell them what we are going to do. I hear what they say back, and they do not even want us negotiating on it for anything because they think it is the wrong place to go. And I think if the [NORP] people understood that all this talk about the budget and the rest - and this is a President who deserves so much praise. When he took office, the deficit was [PERCENT] higher than it is now. It has come down [PERCENT] - what was it? [CARDINAL] - it is like [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL]. So, he is worked very hard to take down the deficit. Now, the [NORP] come in with this and say, 'We have the majority. If you want some of these extensions to happen, you have to go big.' And big means unpaid for, permanent - take it off the table. So, the baseline is different for how we want to invest in the future. Take it off the table, so that these are all taken care of in any discussion we have about simplification or fairness in the tax code that really creates growth, creates more good paying jobs in our country and has many more people participating in the prosperity of our country.' It is about trickle down, trickle down, trickle down. And this is their current manifestation of trickle down, but they have the majority, and so they need to be negotiated with, of course. And the president has his signature, so that gives him leverage in that discussion, but I made it clear - do not count on our votes for that. [INTERVIEWED], could you verify if the Child Tax Credit is added to this bill that you say is too big and destructive, could you still support it? It is in there, it is in there. The Child Tax Credit is in there. But indexing it. They are not going to index it. Instead, they put 'Big Oil' in there. So in others, when you see the bill and you say, 'Well, how can we give better balance to this bill by indexation?' They come in and say, 'No, not indexation - let us go on the other side and do big oil.' There is not even an attempt. But you know what, if they have the votes, this is what they want to do, we do not want to give our imprimatur to it. We will not be accomplices. Does [ORG] agree with you guys? You will have to talk to them. In other words, we have shared values on this and at some place, this bill will be improved by the negotiation that [ORG] will have because they want to sign something. We do not need to be for it. They will have enough [NORP] votes supporting their special interest friends to pass this thing in [TIME]. And that is why I do not want it joined to the omnibus bill - because they do not want to support the omnibus bill, I do not know what happens to the whole package because of that. I think we are on a path - our responsibility is to keep government open for the [NORP] people. They have frivolously indicated that they'd be willing to shut it down, so we have to work hard with the new Speaker, extending the hand of friendship - any suggestions or opportunities we may have to work together - we have that responsibility to find our common ground and that is what we are doing. Somebody had this idea about this big other package. They could not have been thinking of the [ORG] [NORP] as supporters of that when they came up with that. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentstherecordconferencecallpresssecretaryjoshearnestdeputynationalsecurityadvisor", "text": "Yes, I'd just say [CARDINAL] quick things before we go to questions. [CARDINAL] is just to piggyback on something [INTERVIEWED2] said. Both candidates, as you know, have made public their commitment to signing the BSA, and reiterated that commitment [DATE]. And they continue to pursue a conclusion to their election process based on the audit that was agreed to and the commitment to form a government that can bring together [GPE]'s different political factions. And so that is ongoing, and we have urged them to conclude that as soon as position so that we can conclude the agreements that [INTERVIEWED2] referenced. Just [CARDINAL] quick scheduling things that I left out from [DATE]. This was also in that window between the [GPE] meeting and the [ORG] meeting. In addition, to seeing King [PERSON], the President was able to check in with the [ORG] Aspirant countries, and that includes [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE]. And then he was able to have a check-in with [ORG]'s Enhanced Partners. This is something that we focused on in terms of making [ORG] a hub of a truly global security architecture. And [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE] were those Enhanced Partners. And those are just brief check-ins, but they are a key priority to [GPE] that we reiterate [ORG]'s open door and to build these Enhanced Partnerships. Hey, [INTERVIEWED] and [INTERVIEWED2]. Thanks for taking the call. I just want to quickly clarify the President did, in fact, go to that meeting on [GPE], correct? He was just late for it? Yes, he went to the meeting. He was [TIME]. Great. Fantastic. And can you talk a little bit more about these sanctions that you are looking at, kind of what sectors are they going at and really where are they going to target? Sure. I do not want to get ahead of the process of developing these sanctions -- or sorry, in the process of finalizing these sanctions. They have obviously been worked on steadily for some time now. Clearly, the last round of sanctions that we did focused on sectors of the [NORP] economy that would have maximum impact. And so we did sanctions on the arms and financial and energy sectors. We have broad authorities to look at a range of different sectors. So [GPE] is preparing our own additional sanctions. We have very active discussions with the [NORP] that have been ongoing for [DATE] now so that we can share our thinking and have an understanding of their thinking. They are working at [ORG] on their own measures. I think the key point is that [GPE] must continue to face costs for its own escalation. If [GPE] escalates, we stand prepared to escalate our pressure. And that is I think what the leaders are committed to in the face of [GPE]'s continued support for their proxies and to separatists in [GPE], as well as their personnel moving overtly into [GPE]. So, again, we are working this in coordination with the [NORP]. We believe that there needs to be a cost. At the same time, if there can be a peaceful de-escalation, that is preferable. And that is something we would support, provided that President [PERSON] and the [NORP] government is committed to an agreement. And we'd of course have to see follow-through from all sides, including [GPE] and this effort that it is been backing. Hi, thanks for doing the call. Prime Minister [PERSON] [DATE] mentioned that he would be willing to consider paying a ransom, given the imminent execution of a [NORP] citizen. Obviously, President [PERSON] has been very clear in saying that he is not willing to pay ransoms. How will he respond to the Prime Minister [TIME]? Well, I do not think that that is right. Prime Minister [PERSON] has been very firm in sharing our view that it is the wrong thing to do to pay ransom to an organization like [ORG] for a number of reasons. [CARDINAL], that it incentivizes additional kidnappings; [CARDINAL], that it provides them with a key funding source. And, frankly, part of what has allowed [ORG] to grow in [DATE] is access to funding in part through very large ransoms that have been paid. And, [CARDINAL], we just as a general matter do not provide funding to terrorist organizations. So we believe we are in agreement with Prime Minister [PERSON] on that issue. And at the same time, we have urged other governments to adopt a similar approach -- because, tragically, we fear that ransoms incentivize further kidnappings. And so while we certainly understand the sentiments of families and loved ones who want to do whatever is possible to gain the freedom of those who are held hostage, we do that through every resource we have -- military intelligence, law enforcement, diplomacy -- but we do rule out the payment of ransom. And that is a position we have shared with [GPE]. Hi there, thanks for doing this. I wanted to go back to the [ORG] response that you talked about. You said Prime Minister [PERSON] and the President had a chance to talk about a range of ways in which countries could contribute. Did they talk specifically about military action and whether the [NORP] would support [GPE] if President [PERSON] decided to expand airstrikes into [GPE] or elsewhere? And what was the response to that? And then also, on [GPE], could you talk about whether, specifically, direct assistance in the form of weapons for the [NORP] was discussed and what the response was of the [NORP] for that? On the discussion with Prime Minister [PERSON], I do not want to get into specific operational details that may have been discussed, and I certainly do not want to speak for [GPE]. However, I think it is fair to say that the President discussed the range of different tools that it is going to take to confront [ORG]. And we are already doing that through our military action in [GPE], through the strikes that we are taking, but also through intelligence, through the provision of humanitarian assistance, through efforts to crack down on the transitive foreign fighters, through political support for the [NORP] government, and through arming and equipping and training and advising security forces on the ground -- the [NORP] security forces and the [NORP] forces in [GPE]. And, of course, we have been engaged in support for the moderate [NORP] opposition. Thus far, [GPE] has been with us in a range of ways in [GPE]. They have done humanitarian airdrops with us on Sinjar Mountain, for instance; and most recently, in [GPE]. They have provided important intelligence support. They cooperate diplomatically. And so we are discussing the full range of options. Prime Minister [PERSON] spoke to this himself [DATE], and he was looking at the full range of options. So I will let them speak for their own decision-making process. But as you saw in their joint op-ed [TIME], and as was reflected in their conversation, he is very seized with the threat and committed to working as a part of a broad coalition that works in many different ways to confront the threat from [ORG]. On [GPE], the capabilities discussion has focused on, well, both short-term assistance to [GPE] that can fill immediate needs. And we have been focused on non-lethal in our efforts to do so, although things like body armor, night-vision goggles are filling direct requirements that help the [NORP] security services. The [ORG] discussions have also been very focused on supporting the professionalization and modernization and greater capacity of the [NORP] security forces in both the short and long term, and what can we do in training and exercises and equipping to meet that goal. And that is the focus of the discussion [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED2], I do not know if you want to add anything about [ORG]'s partnership with [GPE] on the security side. Yes, so let me just add that after hearing from [PERSON] [DATE] and going around the table among [CARDINAL] [NORP], I think we will be prepared [DATE] to make some announcements about steps that [ORG] is actually prepared to take with regard to supporting [GPE]. But there is a range of things [ORG] can do. Most security assistance, weaponry, body armor and so forth comes from nations, not the [ORG] as a whole. But the [ORG] can perform a very useful and efficient clearinghouse role, both for humanitarian assistance and for security assistance. And I would expect that we may have more to say about that [DATE]. But more broadly, [ORG] has had a something like [DATE] partnership with [GPE], as it has with [CARDINAL] other countries. And [NORP] forces have served with [ORG] in [GPE], in [GPE] and so forth. So [CARDINAL] thing we can do going forward is, based on that partnership, continue to build the capacity of [NORP] forces not for the purposes of working together in [GPE] and [GPE] now, but actually for the purpose -- the fundamental purpose of defending their own country. So [ORG]'s existing relationship by way of this partnership really gives us the platform with which to continue our support to [GPE]. And I expect there will be news on that [DATE]. Great. And again, I should just note that, given the summit is ongoing, [DATE] we would expect a range of announcements on issues related to [ORG] capabilities, support to [GPE], and other issues on the agenda. So we are checking in midway here, so that is the important context that [INTERVIEWED2] gave. Hey, guys. Thanks for doing the call. To go back to [ORG], in the [PERSON]-Cameron op-ed [TIME], it seemed like they were speaking directly to [ORG] members. And I am wondering if you are seeking any kind of concrete deliverables or statements from [ORG] on the [ORG] threat. And then also, if you could talk about anything that they are asking of individual countries on the sidelines of the summit. I'd say a couple of things, and [INTERVIEWED2] may want to add. There is a couple ways of approaching this. [CARDINAL] is individual countries and [CARDINAL] is [ORG]. With respect to individual countries, we will be able to have conversations on the margins of this summit as the President did with Prime Minister [PERSON] about contributions that they can make on an ongoing basis to an effort to confront [ORG]. A number of [ORG] members have already stepped up -- countries like [GPE] and [GPE], as well as [GPE], [GPE] -- in things like supporting the [NORP] and the [ORG] with arms and equipment. A number of them have conducted airdrops; [GPE], for instance, as well. So we will be exploring with individual [ORG] members what contributions they can make to a broad effort to degrade and ultimately defeat [ORG], which, again, will cover many different aspects. Those discussions I think will -- [DATE], as you have seen, [GPE] has been a key agenda item, and [GPE]. At the dinner [TIME], which is a wide-ranging discussion, I would expect the threat from [ORG] to be subject, as well as [DATE] as [ORG] is discussing the current threat environment more generally. So I think there will be additional opportunities for the President to engage the leaders on the issue. Separately, Secretary [PERSON] and Secretary [PERSON] are here, as well as [PERSON]. And they will be able to have discussions with their counterparts on this issue. In terms of [ORG] as an [ORG], there is an existing [ORG] capacity to provide support to [ORG] as well. So that is an essential area of cooperation. Although, again, when we talk about a more --a broader, multi-faceted effort to confront [ORG], clearly different member states would bring to the table different resources. And so those will be discussions that we will be having individually with different heads of state and foreign and defense ministers. But, [INTERVIEWED2], I do not know if you want to add anything to that. The only thing I'd add, [INTERVIEWED], is that this is an [ORG] where summit after summit for [DATE] the discussion has been very much focused on [GPE]. And as that mission is about to transition over completely to [NORP] lead, while we are prepared to continue in [GPE], what you see the [ORG] doing at this summit is looking in [CARDINAL] direction at a time. So it is looking east to the challenges presented by [NORP] aggression, but it is also looking to its southeast, where [GPE] and [GPE] border the [ORG] immediately with the international border with [GPE]. And then also to continued instability to [ORG]'s due south across North Africa. So you have got [ORG] doing [CARDINAL] thing at a time and looking in [CARDINAL] direction at a time. So this is a pretty intense discussion as we move through the agenda. I think the diagnosis of those problems will really culminate at [TIME] [TIME]. MR. [PERSON]: I will just add [CARDINAL] thing to that. I know there was a lot of talk [DATE] about sort of the President's comprehensive strategy for confronting [ORG]. And a core component of that strategy was engaging in conversations with our allies and with regional governments, all of whom have a role to play in confronting this threat. And, obviously, the kinds of conversations that are happening at the presidential level over the course of [DATE] and [DATE] are a core component of that aspect of the strategy. Great. Thanks, we will take the next question. Hi. Let me ask you a little bit more about the idea of a diagnosis. I do not think there is any question, as we have heard expressed from everybody -- from the President to [PERSON] and throughout many of the leaders -- about the problems and how they exist. But when you talk about a diagnosis, what are you sort of drilling down on? I think as a general matter, across a range of issues [DATE], we are looking at challenges and threats. And the nature of the summit is then [DATE] there is focus on outcomes associated with that threat. And the diagnosis of the current threat from terrorism has clearly shifted. [ORG] has been focused on [GPE]. That tracks with our focus over [DATE] on [ORG] core in [GPE] and [GPE]. And we have been able to significantly degrade [ORG] core in [GPE] and [GPE], decimate its leadership ranks, reducing the threat that they pose. At the same time, we have seen the threat of terrorism evolve as different groups emerged in places like North Africa. And then, with [ORG], you have an organization that is the legacy of the [ORG] and [GPE] organization, which changed to [ORG]. And they represent an acute threat in [GPE] and [GPE] [DATE]. So essentially, we have to step back and make decisions based on threat assessments and where the threat is coming from. And we have been able to dramatically reduce the resources dedicated to [GPE] and [GPE] as our troops have come home. That brings up additional resources as necessary to deal with other threats. But the [ORG] has to weigh a variety of demands. They, too, have removed a lot of resources from [GPE], so a lot has been freed up. But there is a need to reassure eastern allies, and we have done that through our own initiative to have more rotational deployments and have a continuous presence in the frontline states. They have to look south to the threat of terrorism, as well. But, [INTERVIEWED2], you may want to jump in, too. Yes. So, I mean, [INTERVIEWED] actually said it well. This is really an inflection point for the [ORG]. So after [DATE] of doing basically the same fundamental big chore, which was [GPE] and the fight against [ORG] -- which, by the way, [ORG] went to [GPE] in the wake of 9/11, and it is the only time in the [DATE] history of the [ORG] that its mutual defense clause, Article 5, has been invoked. So [ORG] has been all about that now for [DATE]. But as that mission winds down, this is a step back and a reflection and a diagnosis of opportunity for the [ORG], because it faces new challenges. [DATE], we were not worried about [GPE] and [GPE] in the way we are [DATE]. [ORG], obviously, has gained prominence. And instability across North Africa continues, sustained. So this is a bit of a point of, step back, look at what is happening immediately on [ORG]'s borders, and then let us figure out what we can do about it. Now, [DATE], that will be the big deliverable. There will be a series of -- we believe leaders will take a series of concrete decisions about what is next for the [ORG]. And you saw a bit of a preview of that [DATE] when the President was in [GPE], but then most prominently [DATE] in [GPE]. And this is going to feature [ORG] taking on these challenges that it now faces and adapting to new realities. And it will have something to do with the way [ORG] postures itself; something to do with how responsive [ORG] is; something to do with how [ORG] deals with its partnerships, and how it deals with these problems immediately on its periphery. So this is -- I do not think this is just any summit. This is a summit where [ORG] really has to do some reflection, look at new realities, and adapt. [INTERVIEWED] was talking earlier on the call about how different [ORG] nations may be able to bring different resources to dealing with [ORG]. That kind of suggests that you are getting sort of a receptive attitude when it comes to dealing with that broadly, with [ORG] partners. Is that the case? Are you feeling that these [ORG] partners are receptive to this type of mission? Yes, [PERSON], I think the evidence for that is what has already been done in [GPE] because of the threat from [ORG]. So, for instance, you have seen [ORG] countries join us in humanitarian airdrops, you have seen [ORG] countries join us in providing arms and equipment to [NORP] and [NORP] forces. That includes a range of countries, even [GPE], for instance, which has not been as involved in [GPE] over [DATE] as, say, [GPE] has stepped forward to do that. So I think when you look at the bigger [ORG] countries, they are seized with the threat, in part because there is a foreign fighter flow that has led many [NORP] citizens and passport holders into [GPE] and [GPE] to fight with [ORG], and then that could, of course, put a threat back into Europe if they return home. So we do believe that there is a receptivity of nations that provide support and to play a role in efforts to confront [ORG]. We believe that is manifested in what is already taken place in [GPE]. And as we are working to build a broad coalition to set in place a type of effort that will shrink [ORG]'s space; take the fight to them, including partners on the frontlines like the [NORP] security force and the [NORP]; degrade their capacity; and then ultimately defeat them -- that is a project that is going to require regional buy-in from the neighbors and international buy-in from some of our key allies. And so I think that that is the message that is well understood here at [ORG]. At the same time, different countries are going to make different types of commitments, and that is very clear. So there are some [ORG] member states who will be focused on intelligence and law enforcement support. There are some who can do more in working in coordination with us on efforts to go after [ORG], or to do the type of humanitarian airdrops that we have done in [GPE] which require military coordination, because obviously that is dependent on intelligence, ISR, and aircraft. So these are all conversations that we will have over [DATE]. Again, importantly, you have Secretary [PERSON], Secretary [PERSON], and [PERSON] all here. Then you are going to have Secretary [PERSON] and Secretary [PERSON] traveling on to the region for discussions with key partners there. [PERSON], the President's counterterrorism advisor, is also going to be traveling to the region. So there is a significant amount of consultation that is taking place. And all of that will inform the President's approach to building the type of coalition that can confront this threat not just in [DATE], but as is necessary going forward beyond that. We have got time for a couple more questions. Hi, everyone. Thank you for doing the call. On the subject of airstrikes in [GPE], [DATE] Prime Minister [PERSON] and the President were on the same page before the [ORG] vote forced the Prime Minister to sort of back away. So I am wondering now if you think the [GPE] and the [GPE] are back in sync, or maybe moving back in sync on the question of the way forward in the region. And I know you get asked this question periodically, but it seems like a good time for a check-in. Do you think the phrase special relationship still applies? [PERSON], it always applies. No, it is definitely a special relationship. There is no country that we are more in sync with in terms of our values and our foreign policy and our security cooperation around the world than [GPE]. And I think that is the spirit that illuminates the discussion that the President had with the Prime Minister. And that is why coming into this summit hosted by [GPE], the President and Prime Minister staked out the agenda for the summit in that op-ed [TIME]. With respect to the subject of [DATE] versus [DATE], first of all, I will leave it to [GPE] to define their efforts in this space. Clearly, Prime Minister [PERSON] has engaged his parliament in discussions of the threat. And so you saw him put forward a presentation about the threat that [ORG] poses. He has not made decisions about things like airstrikes. That is something that they will have to review as they consider the different ways in which they can contribute to this effort. But clearly, he is engaged in that discussion here. And I think that there is a unique nature to this situation given the fact that you have foreign fighters from -- including from [GPE], who have been with [ORG] in [GPE] and in [GPE]. And tragically, you have heard the [NORP] confirm that they believe a [NORP] national was involved in these barbaric beheadings of the [CARDINAL] [NORP] that we tragically lost. That speaks to the fact that this is a threat that could potentially impact them, as well as the people of [GPE] and [GPE], just as it could potentially impact [GPE] interests and [GPE]. In terms of [DATE], it is always worth noting that, look, [GPE] made clear our willingness to use military force. On the specific issue of chemical weapons, [GPE] and [GPE] joined with us in that determination. Clearly, there was a change after the parliament vote here in the [GPE] But at the end of the day, with that threat on the table, the [NORP] regime went from denying it had chemical weapons to agreeing to remove them, and their declared weapons have since been destroyed. This is a different beast because it is been a threat of terrorism that crosses [CARDINAL] borders -- it is [GPE] and [GPE] -- and that could pose a threat beyond those countries. And that is what illuminates the discussion here at [ORG]. [INTERVIEWED] could I just add on that one -- on [ORG]. [CARDINAL] thing that is amazed me as an [NORP] living in Europe is that they are seized with this question of the potential of returning foreign fighters from [ORG] and other extremist groups in the [GPE]-Iraq theater back to Europe. And they actually cite very prominently the attack on [DATE] at [FAC] in [GPE] as the first solid example, proven example of a [NORP] fighter who went to [GPE], gained his -- had his training, gained his sort of street cred, returned and committed an act of -- at least a crime -- act of terror on [NORP] soil. They are very seized about this because they understand there are [CARDINAL] more who are on that path. Now, it does not mean they will all come back and commit acts like this, but even if a fraction of them do, they know they have got a serious security threat. I just wanted to clarify -- [CARDINAL] thing you have not mentioned in trying to get deliverables is trying to get direct military action from [ORG] partners to fight [ORG] in [GPE] or [GPE], and I wanted to see if [DATE] you are hoping for some concrete commitment from the countries here for direct military action against [ORG]? So, look, on that question, we are engaged in discussions with different countries about what role they can take. Direct military action is obviously the far-end of that spectrum in terms of engagement. I think this is something that is going to be ongoing over [DATE] as we talk here and we talk to countries in the region. So in terms of those types of pronouncements, that is not something we are seeking as an outcome of this summit. This summit I think is more a chance to get a sense of the commitments countries will make. They will then have the ability to make decisions and announcements about their own commitments. But we also feel like it is a very important piece of this puzzle to talk to the countries in the region. We have been consulting with them, but with Secretary [PERSON], Secretary [PERSON] and [PERSON] all traveling to the region, that can also give us a sense of additional countries that could contribute in a variety of ways. And then we can get a sense of what is the picture across this coalition of what nations are prepared to do. And again, that spectrum includes direct action, it includes arms and equipment and training for security forces on the ground -- including [NORP] security forces, [NORP] forces, the moderate [NORP] opposition. That includes support to the [NORP] government and its government formation process, and diplomatic support for an inclusive [NORP] government, which is essential to getting a buy-in from [NORP] tribes and others inside of [GPE] to work to evict [ORG] from a territory that they have claimed. And then that includes intelligence resources, law enforcement resources both to get a better understanding of [ORG]'s operations, but also to deal with the challenge of foreign fighters that the President will also be addressing at the [ORG] session. So there is a range of ways that nations can contribute. And actually, the last point I'd make is dealing with the significant humanitarian crisis in both [GPE] and [GPE], which a number of nations have already committed substantial resources to. So there is a spectrum. And again, I think we will have a better sense coming out of this summit as to how key nations are thinking about this and what they are prepared to do. And then we will get a sense -- an additional sense in the region over [DATE]. All of that will inform our own approach, and we will be looking for nations to make their own decisions and announcements about the type of support that they are willing to make. I think for [DATE], the outcomes are really focused on [ORG] as an [ORG] and what they are going to do on a range of issues. That, obviously, includes the threat from [ORG]. It also prominently includes issues like support for [GPE]; issues around [ORG] capabilities; and issues around how do we structure and resource the [ORG] going forward so that it can meet all these various challenges. So with that, I think we will wrap up here. The President will have the dinner [TIME] and then move back into meetings [DATE]. And you will have the press conference from him [DATE] after the conclusion of the summit and his bilateral meeting with Prime Minister [PERSON]. And we will keep you updated on any additional developments in the interim. Thanks, everybody.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforbesmagazineeditorrandalllaneandchiefproductofficerlewisdvorkin", "text": "{INTERVIEWER1]: You have always talked about having fun as a key to business. Are you having fun? I am having fun. I am enjoying it. We are accomplishing a lot. Your stock market is at an all-time high. Your jobs, your unemployment is at the lowest point in [DATE]. We have fantastic numbers coming out. And I think we will have, over the course of the next, fairly short period of time, and more importantly over a long period of time, we are going to have great numbers coming out of our country. What is your personal thought? I enjoy success. And we are having tremendous success, as a country. We have some difficulties with respect to [GPE], the Middle East. I inherited-- and I have said it often--I inherited a mess. The country was having many different problems. Among them, the Middle East, [ORG], which we have done more with respect to [ORG] in [DATE] than we have done in [DATE]. But we have really done, we have done, I would say [DATE] in [DATE], to be specific. But we have done a really, really good job with the military. We are building up our military. We just had an [MONEY] budget, which will be approved. We are , you know, there is been few times where the military was more important than what it is right now. And, in addition to that, which is by far the overriding element, it is lots of jobs in [GPE]. So, what the country is doing, we are doing very well. And on an economic front, we are doing very well. {INTERVIEWER1]: Now that we are [DATE] from the big upset and the big win, do you think your business background prepared you for this job? And were you ready, now that you have [DATE] in? Well, I think it helped. It is certainly a different kind of job than, really there is anywhere. Because you have so many skills necessary. But certainly the campaign was successful. What people do not realize is that I spent much less money than [PERSON]. So right there, perhaps that is business. You know, if you look at the numbers it is astronomically different. {INTERVIEWER1]: Yeah. I do not think anybody's ever written that. You know, in [DATE], if you spent less money and won, that was supposed to be a good thing. [DATE] nobody talks about it. But I spent much less money and won. I think that is --so we start off there--I think that was good. I also think that, yes, being in--[TIME] I had dinner with all of our generals and admirals, at the highest level. You probably saw that. {INTERVIEWER1]: Yeah, I saw the picture right here. Yeah. It was lovely. It was fantastic. But I talked about business. I said, Your equipment is coming in too slowly and at too great a cost. And I actually got involved in negotiating, as an example, the F-35 fighter with [ORG]. You may call [PERSON]], the head of [ORG], who you know, I think. {INTERVIEWER1]: Mhmm. And she is a terrific person. But I developed a bidding system between [ORG] and [ORG]. And I was able to reduce the price of the [ORG] by [MONEY]. By [MONEY]. And this took me, actually, a very small amount of time. And I read a story, and this when I was president-elect, had not come here yet. And I called the military. I said, What is the problem? We met with the generals. I then met with [ORG]. I then--the generals were unable to get anything off the price. And in fact, they wanted to raise the price and claim extras. And I met with [PERSON] [[PERSON]], from [ORG]. I then went and had a very frank discussion with her. I then met with [ORG], and I said, Well, we are going to come out with a competing plane. And then went back to her. And I went back and forth. And the end result is [MONEY] have been taken off the cost of the plane. {INTERVIEWER1]: Well, again, you are negotiating with them. You have obviously a lot of negotiation skills that you bring. And that is [CARDINAL] thing. There are many, many things that I was too late into the game for the President [PERSON] aircraft carrier. But it took too long to build, and it was way over budget. And you know, those things, we are being much more conscious as a country about things such as that. So you have had pain points in business, obviously. Well, I do not know. If you-- Pain points? In other words, obstacles that you have to overcome. Oh, sure. You always have obstacles. So, if you take away the politics of being president, and what you are trying to do with the economy, what are the obstacles that you are finding that you necessarily did not find in your business life? Well, you have [ORG]. That is a big obstacle in many cases. You have, in some cases, well-meaning people in [ORG] that truly feel strongly about something. And I understand that and actually do not mind that. And then of course you have grandstanders and others that want to try and make a point or want to do something that really is not necessarily in the best interests of the country. And those people I fight. And what people do not know is that I have had just about the most legislation passed of any president, in a [DATE] period, that is ever served. We had [CARDINAL] bills passed. I am not talking about executive orders only, which are very important. I am talking about bills. We have had a tremendous amount of legislation passed. Like [ORG] accountability, which nobody could get passed. Meaning people are accountable now, because before you could not do anything if you caught people who worked there doing very bad things. But many, many bills have been passed. And now we are going for taxes. I will get health care. I am [CARDINAL] vote short of health care. I will get health care. And I think block-granting it back to the states is going to be a great thing to do. I think it'll be great for the people. Smaller government, great for the people. They will be able to handle it better. But we are one-- {INTERVIEWER1]: Are you talking about the Graham-Cassidy bill? Yeah, I like it very much. I do. I like it. It is block-granting. It is granting the money back to the states. {INTERVIEWER1]: Right, right. And you have a smaller form of government that is going to be able to do--if they do a proper job--that will be able to do. There are certain states where they are very well run. And I could name them. I could name certain states where they really--they will do miracles with that money, in terms of health care. It will be far better than it is. Because [ORG] has failed, badly. So I am working on that now. But we actually, I would say, I either have the votes or I am [CARDINAL] vote short. And I believe we will get health care done sometime prior to the election. {INTERVIEWER1]: With [ORG], until you come up with something different, do not you feel there is a lot of things going on with [ORG] right now, where, do not you feel you need, as CEO of [GPE], an obligation to make it run as good as it can while it is still the law of the land? Well, that is an interesting, that is a very interesting question. It is a failed concept. It is [CARDINAL] of pages. It is been amended by additional [CARDINAL] of pages. It is a total mess. The premiums are going up, you know. {INTERVIEWER1]: But while it is still the law, do not you think, you know, we are cutting back on advertising, we are shrinking the window of signing up, so-- Well, we are actually, what we are doing is trying to keep it afloat, because it is failing. I mean the insurance companies are fleeing and have fled. They fled before I got here. But with that being said, no, [ORG] is [PERSON]'s fault. It is nobody else's fault. In fact, if you go back to-- {INTERVIEWER1]: Yes, but now it is your administration's responsibility. Yes. But I have always said [ORG] is [PERSON]'s fault. It is never going to be our fault. With that being said, I think the [NORP] want to make a deal. At the same time, I think I have a deal with the [NORP]. So I have the best of both worlds. That is business to a certain extent-- {INTERVIEWER1]: Right. --when you asked the business question. And as you have noticed, I am very able to make deals with [NORP] if I have to. {INTERVIEWER1]: Who have you found so far are better deal-making partners, the [PERSON]-McConnell set or the [PERSON]-Schumer set? Well, the [NORP] have something called the filibuster rule. Which is a disaster. And if they do not get rid of that, it is always going to be very tough for them. You know what that is. {INTERVIEWER1]: Yes, well, of course. The filibuster rule is-- {INTERVIEWER1]: It is a disaster when you are in the majority. It is a friend when you are in the minority. Well, you need [CARDINAL] [NORP] votes every time. I mean, they literally need [CARDINAL] [NORP] votes. And, they keep it for the sake of history. But history is that, in [DATE], when it all began, what it actually, when they started voting, it was [DATE], the first votes, that was a simple majority. And we should go back to a simple majority. If we had the filibuster rule, if we had the [CARDINAL] votes for Justice [PERSON], he would not be sitting on the bench right now because for the judges that has been taken off. And part of my plan is that the [NORP] would take it off in [TIME]. And the Republicans-- {INTERVIEWER1]: Well, they did not when they had a majority. Well, they were going to. Well, they did it for the judge. Do not forget, [PERCENT] of that work was done before we got there. So I think the filibuster rule is very bad. At the same time, I think if we pass taxes, I think we will have health care and taxes before. I believe we will have a great infrastructure bill before, which is easiest of all of them. In fact, I think I will have more [NORP] votes for infrastructure than I will [NORP] votes. And I also have another bill that I think will be very--an economic development bill, which I think will be fantastic. Which nobody knows about. Which you are hearing about for the first time. But I am going to do that. But before-- {INTERVIEWER1]: What is that? What does that mean? Economic development incentives for companies. Incentives for companies to be here. Incentives for companies to do things. What kind of incentives? And it'll be a great bill. It is something I have had. I just do not want to do it before I do health care-- {INTERVIEWER1]: So business, like [ORG]? Business incentives to create jobs, keep jobs? So that when companies leave our country, they get penalized severely. So that when companies stay in our country, they are incentivized. But there will not be any more companies, and it is really stuck. I hope you have seen--again, this is an interview where I am doing the talking, I guess--but I hope you have seen that companies are moving back into our country. You saw [ORG], [CARDINAL] plants. Other companies, car companies are moving back into our country. They are expanding their plants. {INTERVIEWER1]: So is it a carrot-- We have a lot of-- {INTERVIEWER1]: So is it a carrot to get companies to stay and/or grow? Or is it a stick that you penalize? It is both. It is both. It is both a carrot and a stick. It is an incentive to stay. But it is perhaps even more so--if you leave, it is going to be very tough for you to think that you are going to be able to sell your product back into our country. {INTERVIEWER1]: How comfortable are you, as a businessperson, having the government involved in a business decision about where a company wants to locate? And where a company wants to put jobs. Very comfortable, because there is no tax if you stay. There is no tax. We have to protect our companies. And if you looked at what is happened, they have been ravaged by the stupidity of politics and, frankly, the stupidity of politicians. They have been ravaged. And we have to protect our companies. We have to protect our workers. And the only way you are going to do that is you have to create rules. I mean, when you talk about, [INTERVIEWER1], when you talk about fairness, do you think it is fair that some countries charge us [PERCENT] tariff, or tax, to sell a product in their country? And yet the same product coming out of that country coming into our country comes into our country for no tax. See, that makes it unfair for our companies. And what I want to do is reciprocal. See, I think the concept of reciprocal is a very nice concept. If somebody is charging us [PERCENT], we should charge them [PERCENT]. Right now they charge us [PERCENT], and we charge them nothing. That does not work with me. {INTERVIEWER1]: You are also taking steps with the corporate tax rate. Which I think there is a lot of consensus on that. Yes. {INTERVIEWER1]: In terms of the individual tax code, you campaigned on tax reform that does not increase the deficit. Are you sticking with that? Yes. This will not increase, this will lower the deficit, because I think we are going to take off like we have never taken off before. This is going to bring jobs back. This is going to bring [MONEY] back. {INTERVIEWER1]: The corporate tax cuts. Yeah, well, the offshore money. {INTERVIEWER1]: Offshore money, right. That is part of it. {INTERVIEWER1]: But in terms of individual tax-rate reform, without spending cuts, even with dynamic scoring, it is going to increase the deficit. So are you committing to then having offsetting-- Yes. {INTERVIEWER1]: --spending cuts? First of all, we are going to have some spending cuts, okay. We are going to really have some spending cuts. But I will tell you that most of what we are going to do is we are going to gain. Look at GDP. So GDP [DATE] was [PERCENT]. Most of the folks that are in your business, and elsewhere, were saying that would not be hit for a long time. You know, [PERSON] never hit the number. {INTERVIEWER1]: He hit [PERCENT]. He hit [CARDINAL] a couple quarters. He never hit it on a [DATE] basis. Never hit it on a [DATE] basis. That is [DATE]. I think we will go substantially higher than that. And I think [DATE] would have been phenomenal, except for the hurricanes. The hurricanes were very very--actually there was some really good things on the jobs report that just came out. You saw. {INTERVIEWER1]: Yep, yep. The hurricanes had a huge impact on and, you know, as soon as I saw the first hurricane I said, That is bad. Then I saw the second, the third, the fourth. But the hurricanes will have an impact of, could even be a point. I was saying [CARDINAL] a point, could even be a point. But that is somewhat artificial. Now, we are going to have some great success. What I am saying, though, is that the tax cuts will spur business. Companies will stay in our country--they will not be leaving. Companies will be hiring people. They will be expanding. They will be building new plants, and that is what it is all about. It will be a great spur, so through growth, our deficits will come down. {INTERVIEWER1]: [DATE] you said twice, both on the South Lawn and in [GPE], that you will not personally benefit from this new tax reform. Do you still hold to that? Well, what I say is that the, this whole concept, everybody benefits if the country does well. We all do. You guys benefit. Everybody benefits if the country does well. We are the highest-taxed nation in the world--now some people like to say developed nation, but I have not found too many that are higher. We are the highest-taxed developed nation in the world, probably the highest-taxed nation in the world. It makes it very uncompetitive when you are paying [PERCENT] [PERCENT], if you start including state taxes and other things that many businesses have to, depending on what state they are in, and in [GPE] you are at [PERCENT] and in other countries you are at numbers far lower than that. So, we are bringing it to [CARDINAL], I was thinking in terms of [CARDINAL]. {INTERVIEWER1]: The corporate tax, the corporate tax rate. Actually. The corporate tax rate. I was actually saying [CARDINAL] for the purpose of getting to [CARDINAL]. {INTERVIEWER1]: Right. But it was a spread that I did not like. You know I did not want to be talking about, so we started at [CARDINAL] with the understanding I am not negotiating. I actually wanted the [CARDINAL], so that, because as you know, this will be a negotiation-- {INTERVIEWER1]: Sure. --for [DATE]. {INTERVIEWER1]: But in terms-- But I wanted the [CARDINAL] in order to get to [CARDINAL]. {INTERVIEWER1]: But in terms of the tax reform and what is on the table so far, there is a lot of people saying, Oh, [PERSON]'s not as rich. You are worth many [CARDINAL], we have looked at you for [DATE], and we all know that. The estate tax, the death tax ... Did you say [PERSON]'s not as rich? What? {INTERVIEWER1]: No, other people are saying that. We say [PERSON]'s worth [CARDINAL]. You say you are worth more than we estimate, but the point is, if the estate tax in the current plan is going away, that is [MONEY], even on our number, that benefits you. How do you square that and being able to sell that to the [NORP] people? Well, we are going to have to see what happens. We are going to have to see what happens. The estate tax is for many, many family companies where people are forced to sell their businesses. That includes farms. But it includes a lot of businesses, any business--not even small businesses only. Large businesses also, where the estate tax is so onerous that families are forced to sell and some cases have fire sales and not get proper pricing. And in many cases, those businesses do not do very well after the family leaves. So that is the primary reasoning behind the estate tax. But we will be talking about estate tax. We will be talking about all of it. You know, it will be a very serious set of negotiations going on over the next period of time. But the estate tax is really for those businesses, of which there are many, that are forced to go out of business or forced to sell for that reason. {INTERVIEWER1]: Yes, but you could raise that threshold higher. I think the point that for someone like yourself, as president--the first businessman president--how do you push forward a bill that would, right now, as written, give you and your family [MONEY]' worth advantage just on that clause alone? Well, the big advantage that I would get is if the economy does well. That is a great thing for me--politically and otherwise. But the economy is a very--you know it is very interesting, [INTERVIEWER1]. I built a great business, but it does not mean anything to me. My children are running it. It does not mean anything to me anymore. I do not even think about it because this is so big, what I am doing now, so big and so, so important because this country was going in the wrong direction. We were heading toward a really bad situation. And if you remember, when I got elected, the stock market dropped and then they heard my speech, and it dropped. And then it went up more than it dropped. It went down [CARDINAL] points, and then it went up a lot--whatever it was, much more than that. And then since then, it is gone-- {INTERVIEWER1]: Yeah, you are up [PERCENT]. How much? {INTERVIEWER1]: Up [PERCENT], right? No, [CARDINAL] since the election. You have to go since the election. {INTERVIEWER1]: Depends which index, but yes. Since [DATE] it is [PERCENT]. It has gone up since [DATE] [MONEY]. If [PERSON] would have won, the markets would have gone down substantially. Instead of [MONEY]. It was interesting, I just saw the number [DATE], [MONEY]. It was just announced that since [DATE] [DATE], the markets have gone up [MONEY]. They have gone up [PERCENT]. Because the Nasdaq was [CARDINAL], et cetera, et cetera. [CARDINAL] of your sons, I believe it was [PERSON], told [ORG] that he would give you [DATE] reports on the your business, on your former business. Is that happening? I have not seen a report. You know, I have, I built, I think the thing that I--look obviously people know I have been very successful but I built a truly great company with truly great assets and very little debt, and I do not think that is been recognized to the extent it should. And I do not care about it so much anymore because this is--you know, I am here. {INTERVIEWER1]: But do you talk? Do you check in on how they are doing? You know what? He may be doing [DATE] reports. I have not seen any yet. I know he is , you know, he is doing a very good job because I know the kind of person he is. He is running it with [PERSON]. And they are doing a very good job, I would imagine. But it is very good stuff that they are running. {INTERVIEWER1]: Again, between your business success and then this big tax bill, do you think the [NORP] public has a right to know how you will personally fare with this new-- Yeah. Yeah, I think so. {INTERVIEWER1]: And then to that-- You see, you have to understand, if what I do is good for the middle class, that is also good for me, and then if I do what is good for the upper class, that is good for me. Do not forget--the companies that we are talking about--many people own some of these companies. And sometimes wealthy people own them, and sometimes poor people own them. But when we make life and business better for companies, that is a great thing for everybody, including me... . But people are dying to know if I have any benefit. {INTERVIEWER1]: Right. And I ask them, and I tell them, most important, this is a jobs bill. This is a jobs tax cut and reform. It is a tax cut. It is a massive tax cut. {INTERVIEWER1]: Right. Will be the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. It is a massive tax cut, and it is a reform. It is both. {INTERVIEWER1]: So it is a massive tax cut, but then that runs against your pledge to not increase the deficit because you cannot , you know. No, because, no, because a tax cut will spur growth. {INTERVIEWER1]: Yes, that is true, and there is dynamic scoring The growth, the growth will be so much that it'll be-- {INTERVIEWER1]: Yes, but history has shown that you cannot just cut. It does spur growth, but it will not pay for itself. History has shown that. Well, history has also shown the opposite. I mean, you have had it both ways. It has shown both ways. {INTERVIEWER1]: Which time have you been able to cut and out of growth cut-- Well, during [PERSON], during [PERSON], during his cuts, he--tremendous growth. {INTERVIEWER1]: It spurred growth, but it also ballooned the deficit. My feeling is that we are losing so much business, and so many companies are leaving our country, and so many companies are doing so badly. Look at our steel industry. Look what is happening with our steel industry. Now I am going to give them additional help, as you will see later from economic development plans, because we are not going to let these industries be taken advantage of by the other countries. What has happened and what will be happening is not only will we have massive tax cuts and reform. Not only will we have the largest regulation cuts in the history of a presidency--there has never been a president who has cut regulations anywhere even close, and I am not nearly finished. You know the ones I have done. And I am actually doing one [DATE], which will be massive. But we have cut. Now, I believe in regulation, by the way, but it is got to be reasonable regulation. It cannot take [DATE] to build a highway-- {INTERVIEWER1]: Right. --to get approved. {INTERVIEWER1]: Right. It cannot take, to put up a structure someplace, [DATE] before you find out that you are not allowed to build it. You know, that is what is been happening. You saw what I did with [FAC], [FAC], approved within [TIME]--approved. In fact, the one is now built, and the other one's under construction. [CARDINAL] jobs. Now we are going to have massive growth. We are going to have massive job production. We are going to, I think very, very importantly, help the companies because I am going to be following this up with a bill that makes it more fair for our companies. [CARDINAL] of the unfair, probably the--I will not even say the worst aspect, but one of the bad aspects--was taxes, but we have worse because some countries treat our companies so unfairly that it is almost impossible for them to compete. And we will be straightening that out in a different bill which will be coming, which I have never really discussed publicly very much, but which will be coming fairly soon after the tax cuts... . We have cut, we have cut regulations, or deregulation, but we have cut regulations more than any president ever in history, and it is not even close, and this is [DATE]. And there is more coming. I do not know if you saw when I held up that highway chart [DATE]. {INTERVIEWER1]: Yes. Where it took [DATE] [DATE]. We have highways that have been under negotiation for [DATE]. Roads, bridges--you know you cannot build. [DATE] are over. We are trying to get it down to a maximum of [DATE], so that instead of [CARDINAL] it'll be a maximum of [CARDINAL]. And, by the way, they may not get approved. But if they do not get approved, you are going to know fast. You are not going to be going [DATE] and then find out you cannot build. So besides your own vision for [ORG] and the success that you provide, you have always said talent matters. Talent you bring in matters. How do you feel that you have done so far with managing the talent that you have brought in to [ORG], to your administration? Well, I think you have different kinds of talent. I have some that is terrific, that is unknown to the public for the most part, that has been incredible. {INTERVIEWER1]: Who have been your biggest successes? I have had a lot. I hate to point them out because then when I do not point somebody out they are disappointed. And then I have had some that I have been disappointed in. I have had some that I thought would be very good that I am not as happy as I thought. But I have had some-- {INTERVIEWER1]: Examples? --I have had some disappointments. Excuse me? {INTERVIEWER1]: Example? Well, I do not want to use examples now, but I have had some that I am not, that I have not been happy with and that frankly right now I am not that thrilled with. I was disappointed. I thought they'd be better. And I have had some that turned out better than I thought. {INTERVIEWER1]: What did surprise you about the ones that did not turn out better? Was it-- You never know when to fire. You can meet somebody, and you can see somebody sitting in front of you, and you can even look at their record to a certain extent. Do not forget one of your early questions is: How does this compare with the business? Well, it is a different set of skills. You need more skill for this. And you need more heart. You also need more heart. Because a lot of your decisions here are based on what is good for people, not just what is good for the budget or what is good for the pocketbook. But, so it is, there are tremendous skill sets from the world of business that are great. But you need additional skill. You also need political skill-- {INTERVIEWER1]: Where-- And you need political instinct. People in business, many people in business have no political instinct, or you do not know if they do. But I have had people that I am extremely pleased with, that I actually think have been better than I would have thought. And I have had some--I mean for the most part I got it right--but I have had some that I am disappointed. I have had some that I am still disappointed. You are very public about that. Do you think that is a positive? Yeah, I think it is positive. I think people understand it. That is the way life is, sure. {INTERVIEWER1]: Where are you [DATE] with Secretary [PERSON]? He came out of a great company. A company that has been around a long time. I do not mind opposing views, but he and I have some opposing views. I think we have to be a much, much stronger in stance. And, ultimately, my view matters. That is the way life goes. But I have a very good relationship with him. And generally speaking, we get along very well. {INTERVIEWER1]: There are reports out [DATE] over [DATE] about him calling you a moron privately. Has he talked, reached out to you about that? Do you believe that he said that? Well, we may have to, if he did that--which he says he did not , by the way, he said he did not . And they announced with [ORG] that he did not . I think it is fake news, but if he did that, I guess we will have to compare IQ tests. And I can tell you who is going to win. {INTERVIEWER1]: You have had a lot of turnover, you have had-- But so does everyone else. {INTERVIEWER1]: Yeah, you know we-- Well, one of the biggest advantages that I have, that somebody like me has, is that I was not in politics, so I have not gotten to know [GPE] for [DATE]. I do not know everybody here. I have had to make new relationships. So that is -- {INTERVIEWER1]: So was that hiring mistakes or was it management mistakes in terms of-- No, in some cases it was not a mistake. It might just be a different style. But overall I think I have got it right, and I think that there is always a lot of turnover, especially in [DATE] of [ORG]. But overall, I think I have a great group of people. [PERSON]: I just, I know you have a speaking engagement soon so [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] more [questions]. What time is it, [TIME]? That is all right. Feel free. [PERSON]: Okay {INTERVIEWER1]: Okay, thanks. A lot of your appointments--you say this, and it is true--it has taken you longer to get them through the [ORG], but you have also made fewer -- No, no, no, it is not taking me longer. {INTERVIEWER1]: It is taking the [ORG] longer to confirm It is taking the obstructionist people. {INTERVIEWER1]: Absolutely right. But you have also made many fewer appointments than other presidents at this stage. Is that an intentional-- That is because I do not need as many people. And that has to do with business also. And I have said that loud and clear, but nobody wants to write it. {INTERVIEWER1]: So is it that you are not going to make those appointments, ever? I am generally not going to make a lot of the appointments that would normally be--because you do not need them. I mean, you look at some of these agencies, how massive they are, and it is totally unnecessary. They have [CARDINAL] of people. And you look at--so the appointments, I have made some great appointments. You take a look at the appointments we have made. But [CARDINAL] things that nobody mentions that I think are very important: judges. I have many, many judges in the pipeline. Already we have had approved a number. Federal judges. I am not just talking about Justice [PERSON], [ORG], I am talking about many federal judges. And I will have [CARDINAL] federal judges. I am getting praised--right, I mean, are you disputing that? It is [CARDINAL]. That does not include the court-of-appeals judges, which will be [CARDINAL]. So we have had a tremendous amount of judges. Many are in the pipeline, and we are being praised for the quality of the people we are putting on the court system. That is a very big factor. In addition, so if you look already in [DATE], numerous judges have already been approved. Many are in the pipeline. Others are now, as we speak, being chosen. And our system is working very, very well. We will have made a stamp on the court system the likes of which I do not think anybody has ever been able to do before, because we have so many. Who do you call, who do you pick up the phone and call and say, I need to talk. I have a question. Well, I have friendships, I have relationships. Largely the relationship is where I am--in other words, now it is very much of a [GPE] relationship. I deal with people here. It is a very fair question. I do like to call friends. I do not have much time, believe it or not. I am definitely a working president. I come in early. I start very early. [DATE] I have already spoken to the head of [GPE] and the head of other countries. And you know, I mean, this is very much of a, in fact I have my actual working desk inside. This looks very nice, do not let that fool you. But more family, I think, than anything else. Plus I have some very good friendships in business. And I do like to get opinions. I am somebody that very much accepts opinions from people that I know understand what is going on in the world. Is it at times lonely? It is a lonely position, because the decisions are so grave, so big. If it is a big--like, if you buy airplanes, it is [MONEY]. It is not like you are buying a plane. It is [MONEY]. But that is not--the decision I made on [GPE], for example, going in and firing [CARDINAL] rockets, missiles, into [GPE]. When I had to give the go-ahead for that, that is a very hard decision to make. You do not know. Every one of them hit their target with incredible technology--Tomahawks in that case, but incredible technology. And I was actually sitting with the president of [GPE] at the time, having dessert in [GPE], at [FAC]. But you know those decisions are tough decisions. It is lonely. And you have to make them yourself. And the military is--we have the greatest military. And by the way, our military is getting so much stronger, so much better. And rapidly. But I will tell you, you make those decisions all by yourself. Did business prepare you for that decision? No, nothing prepares you for that. Nothing prepares you for-- when you send missiles, that means people are going to die. And nothing really prepares you for that. {INTERVIEWER1]: So where are you and [GPE] right now, and what is the endgame? You spent your whole life negotiating, but you have not left any room for negotiation. So where do we go? There is not that much room left. There is not that much room left. Look, this should have been taken care of by [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] previous administrations. It certainly should have been taken care of over [DATE]. And [DATE] makes it a more difficult situation. And right now, I mean President [PERSON] told me--sitting right there, the [CARDINAL] of us. He said that the previous--in the meeting we had prior to my coming into [FAC]--he said that was his toughest decision. But I said, but you did not make a decision, because you did not do anything. You let it go on. I just, I feel strongly you cannot allow him to have nuclear weapons. {INTERVIEWER1]: And you have kind of shut off, again with Secretary [PERSON]. You have told him, stop wasting his time with diplomatic-- He was wasting his time. {INTERVIEWER1]: Let us hypothesize that there could be a good-cop, bad-cop scenario. How can somebody who is under you be taken seriously as any kind of cop if his boss has undermined his authority? Well, I am not undermining. I think I am actually strengthening authority. But in the case of [GPE], they have been talking for [DATE]. Obviously, that does not work. {INTERVIEWER1]: Similarly, you inherited a lot of deals. [GPE], [ORG], [GPE] ... [ORG], I am very proud of the fact that-- {INTERVIEWER1]: But do not you think, just the question-- Yes. {INTERVIEWER1]: Do not you have an obligation as CEO of [GPE], even if you do not agree with these deals, to continue some of these deals-- No. {INTERVIEWER1]: Otherwise every administration is just undoing each other's deals. Well, [ORG] was not a signed deal. It would have been a disaster. It would have been a large-scale version of NAFTA, which is a disaster. I inherited the NAFTA. It is a disaster for this country. {INTERVIEWER1]: A lot of business loves, thinks NAFTA has been great, so-- No. You take a look at your car manufacturing plants, go down to [GPE]. [PERSON]: [TIME] minutes, we are wrapping up. [TIME]. If you take a look at your car manufacturing plants, [INTERVIEWER1], NAFTA has been a disaster for manufacturing in this country. We have lost so much of our car business to [GPE]. [ORG] is a disaster as a deal. Now we are renegotiating it. I happen to think that NAFTA will have to be terminated if we are going to make it good. Otherwise, I believe you cannot negotiate a good deal. It is a terrible deal for our country. It is been a terrible deal. It was a mistake. [ORG] would have been a large-scale version of NAFTA. It would have been a disaster. It is a great honor to have--I consider that a great accomplishment, stopping that. And there are many people that agree with me. I like bilateral deals. {INTERVIEWER1]: But we are in a multilateral-- We would have gone into a hornet's nest. No, no, but you can have it this way and do much more business. And if it does not work out with a country, you give them a [DATE] notice, and you either renegotiate or not. But TPP would have been a disaster for the country. Well, let us look at it differently. I also took things and made them happen that were not going to happen, like the big pipeline deals. Those were deals that were not going to happen--48, [CARDINAL] jobs. Those were deals that were not going to happen that I made happen, and I made them happen immediately. {INTERVIEWER1]: Is there a focus on deals versus policy? We are in a multilateral world--at least take something like the Marshall Plan or foreign aid. Are you still talking about cutting foreign aid even though a lot of people acknowledge that the Marshall Plan was actually great for [GPE] overall? As a single deal, it might not look great, but as a policy, it was incredibly effective. For me, it is [GPE] first. We have been doing that so long that we owe [MONEY], okay? It is [GPE] first. We have to build up our country. I got elected. It is called Make America Great Again. We have debt. We have deals going. I mean, the deal we made, as an example, the trade deal we made with [GPE], is a terrible deal. We are renegotiating it. It is a terrible deal, and we are renegotiating that deal right now. At the same time, we are helping them militarily. But they have to treat us fairly, and other countries have to treat us fairly. As an example, we defend [GPE]. I am very good friends with many of the people in [GPE], including the king. I have great respect. [GPE] is a very wealthy country. Why are we defending them, and not being properly taken care of economically? It does not make sense. Nobody ever thought of it. There are many countries that are extremely wealthy that we defend. Why are we defending them, and spending money to defend them, and they are not reimbursing us properly and fully? And I am doing that. At the same time, we will have better relationships than we have right now. You know, I have very good relationships with the leaders of countries. {INTERVIEWER1]: In terms of [GPE], [ORG] reached out to [CARDINAL] states and confirmed that [GPE] was meddling with their elections. Do you think [GPE] meddled in the [GPE] election in [DATE]? Well, they just announced that there was no vote change, number [CARDINAL]. {INTERVIEWER1]: I do not think the question has ever been messing with the total tally. Really it is been influence. They just said there was no change in vote. They just said that. They also just said that there has been absolutely no collusion. They just said that. [DATE]. [DATE]. [ORG]. There has been no collusion. I did not speak to [NORP]. Everyone knows that that was just a statement put out by the [NORP] so that they could have an excuse for losing an election that in theory they should have won because it is very easy for the [NORP] to win the electoral college. And not only did not they win, it was [CARDINAL] to--what was it?--223, if you could get the right number. It was [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL]. That was an excuse for the [NORP] not winning the election. [Ed. Note: [PERSON] received [CARDINAL] electoral votes.] {INTERVIEWER1]: But now that you are in this seat, does it bother you that the [NORP] tried to meddle with the election? It would bother me greatly if that is the case. It would bother me greatly. And I look forward to seeing what the final reports are. And hopefully they will come out soon, so if there are suggestions, we can do those suggestions prior to the [DATE] election. But it has been taking so long, all of the various studies and reports, but I would like to see what everybody comes up with, so that we can, if there is something to do with respect to the [DATE] elections, which are right around the corner, we will have time to do it. Do not forget, we have those elections now in [DATE]. There is not that much time. So I would like to see that, because I do not want [GPE] messing with our elections, nor do I want anybody or any other country messing with our elections, that is for sure. [PERSON]: I am so sorry, we do have to wrap up. If you have [CARDINAL] closing question to just kind of tie everything together. So [GPE], hurricanes--nothing like that happened in your business of that magnitude. What were you able to bring from your former business career that helped you deal with that kind of thing? Well, I have gotten very high marks for the hurricanes. And I think I really feel that the reason is because of what I have done, to a certain extent, in business. We mobilized. I put some excellent people in charge of [ORG]. We have some excellent people that I worked with. We had fast mobilization. We had mobilization before the hurricanes even hit, which other people did not do. You probably noticed that in terms of signing emergency orders, they were signed immediately as opposed to waiting for long, long periods of time, and then, by that time, it was too late. And you had catastrophes that had lasting damage. I think, yeah, I think that there is a natural business instinct for that. And we worked closely with the governors, and we have had some really great governors to work with. Governor of [GPE]. The governor of [GPE]. We have really had some, I think, great relationships, but the mobilization went very, very well. And you look at what is going on in [GPE]. They are rebuilding. They are going to be back very soon. [GPE] is going to be back, way ahead of schedule. I have done a very good job in [GPE]--have not been given the same kind of credit, but if you speak to the governor of [GPE] and other representatives, you will see that they were thrilled. [GPE], [GPE]--people do not even talk about it, but the governor of [GPE], Governor [PERSON], gave us an A+. He said the job we have done has been incredible. He said that [DATE], very officially. Governor [PERSON]. [PERSON], terrific guy. But yeah, we have gotten very high marks for that. Then we had the tragedy in [GPE], which is a whole different thing. That was a very, very sad occurrence. I was there. I was in the hospitals. I met some incredible people, though horribly wounded. They were horribly wounded. But it, in [CARDINAL] sense, taught me how great our country is, the fact that they can get back on their feet so quickly Thank you. Yeah. We have some great--the people of this country are just great. I mean, more than anything else, all of the hurricanes, the [GPE] tragedy, it teaches me how great the people of our country are. {INTERVIEWER1]: Do you support these initiatives about the bump stock? Oh, we are going to look at that very closely. This has just come up. And we are going to take a look at that very closely. {INTERVIEWER1]: Last question, related to what [INTERVIEWER2] just said, you have pretty much never had a boss. In some ways, now you do have a boss--the [NORP] people. How has this changed? I have [CARDINAL] bosses. {INTERVIEWER1]: Right. So how has this changed how you operate as an executive? It does not change, because all I want to do is the right thing. You will see that I will make decisions that are not politically popular, but they are the right thing to do. So I do have [CARDINAL] bosses, but it does not matter, because I am going to do the right thing. I think that is another thing that maybe you will do more as a businessperson than you would as a politician. A politician is going to do the politically correct thing. I am going to do the right thing for the country. [PERSON]: Thanks guys. Thank you. Thank you very much. {INTERVIEWER1]: Thanks. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED1]. Appreciate it.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithchriswallacefoxnewssunday3", "text": "[INTERVIEWED], welcome back to [ORG]. It is great to be with you. It is been a while. Better late than never. You are trying to pressure [ORG] [NORP] to consider Judge [PERSON]. But [ORG] [NORP], the [ORG], is applying pressure of its own. And [DATE], [CARDINAL] [ORG] [NORP], [PERSON] and [PERSON], reversed themselves, and said they no longer support even holding confirmation hearings. So far, there has not been a break in [NORP] ranks. Well, I think that things will evolve as people get familiar with Judge [PERSON]'s record. As it becomes apparent that the overwhelming majority of the [NORP] people think that the President nominates somebody to [ORG], and the [ORG] should now do its constitutional job and give him a hearing. And originally, the [NORP] said they would not meet with him at all. Now, a number of them have already had meetings. And the questioning that they are having privately with Judge [PERSON] is something that should be done publicly. Through a hearings process, so the [NORP] people can make their own assessment. But I recognize there is pressure on the other side. Our goal is just to make sure that the [ORG] does its job and treats him fairly. Now, you talk about the [ORG] doing its job. You are calling for an up-or-down vote on Judge [PERSON]. Yes. But back in [DATE], Senator [PERSON] joined a filibuster on [PERSON], a [PERSON] appointee, which would have prevented an up or down vote. Is not there a fair amount of hypocrisy on both sides, frankly, including you? I think there is no doubt that [NORP] and [NORP] have gotten into a fix inside the [ORG], in which the confirmation process becomes too much of a tit for tat, or becomes politicized. I will point out though, [PERSON], that never has a [NORP] president's nominee not received a hearing, not received a vote. So, I do not object to [NORP] saying, Look, [PERSON] may be a fine man. He may be an excellent judge, but I just disagree with him philosophically on a whole range of issues, so I am going to vote against him. So, you'd be OK if he got defeated, as long as they go through the process? I think that if they go through the process, they will not have any rationale to defeat him. So my point is, go through the process, go through the hearings. I think if you do that, the [NORP] people and the majority of senators will determine that, in fact, he is qualified to be on the [ORG]. Some [NORP] senators say, Look, if a [NORP] wins in [DATE], well maybe we will consider [PERSON] in a lame duck hearing. Yes. Have you made a commitment to [PERSON] that you are going to stick by him through the end of your term? Or perhaps, let us say [PERSON] is the newly elected president, would you pull him and let her make the pick? As more senators meet with him, I think they will recognize the qualities of this individual. What I think we cannot have is a situation in which [ORG] simply says, Because it is a [NORP] president, we are not going to do our job, have hearings, and have a vote. But -- Because if that happens, [PERSON], then it is almost impossible to expect that the [NORP] -- let us say a [NORP] president won -- that the [NORP] would not say the exact same thing. They will say, Let us wait for [DATE], and we will take our chances on the next president. But just to button this up -- Yes. Are you saying you will stick with [PERSON] through the end of your term? Yes. No pulling him after -- Absolutely not. I want to ask you about an interview, and extensive interview you did with [ORG] recently. It says that you think that the fear of terrorism among politicians, among the press, among the public, is exaggerated. And then the article goes on to say, quote, [PERSON] frequently reminds his staff that terrorism takes far fewer lives in [GPE] than handguns, car accidents, and falls in bathtubs do. Do we make too big a deal of the terror threat? I do not think we make too big of a deal of the terror threat. My number [CARDINAL] job is to protect the [NORP] people. My number [CARDINAL] priority right now is defeating [ORG]. My number [CARDINAL] priority throughout my presidency has been going after terrorist networks that would attempt to do harm to -- So what you are point? -- [NORP] inside, or outside of [GPE]. My point is that, how we do it is important, that we have to make sure that we abide by our laws. We have to make sure that we abide by our values. And we have to make sure that what we do does not end up being counterproductive. So when I hear some candidates saying we should carpet bomb innocent civilians -- [PERSON] -- that is not a productive approach to defeating terrorism. When I hear people suggesting that we should ban all [NORP] from entering the country, that is not a good approach to defeating terrorism. Our approach has to be smart. But the pushback against this -- Uh-huh. -- when you say more people die in bathtub accidents, and I understand you are not saying it is not important, but you are saying we cannot overreact to it, is bathtub manufacturers are not trying to kill us, and they are not trying to up the body count -- I think it is fair to say that some of the sharpest criticism of you, from both sides during your presidency, has been the way that you have responded -- personally, not necessarily in policy -- to terror attacks. After [PERSON] was beheaded, you went out and played golf. After [GPE], you said it was a setback. Even as we grieve with our [NORP] friends, however, we cannot lose sight that there has been progress being made. After [GPE], you talked about gun control. Right now, people on the no fly list can walk into a store and buy a gun. That is insane. And some people wonder, I think the concern is, do you worry about terrorism and feel the threat of terrorism the way they do? And I would say this -- there is not a president who is taken more terrorists off the field than me, over [DATE]. I am the guy who calls the families, or meets with them, or hugs them, or tries to comfort a mom, or a dad, or a husband, or a kid, after a terrorist attack. So, let us be very clear about how much I prioritize this. This is my number [CARDINAL] job -- Then why is it -- -- and we have been doing it effectively. You are -- So why do people sometimes think you are diffident -- Well, I think part of it is that, in the wake of terrorist attacks, it has been my view consistently that the job of the terrorists, in their minds, is to induce panic, induce fear, get societies to change who they are. And what I have tried to communicate is, You cannot change us. You can kill some of us, but we will hunt you down, and we will get you. And in the meantime, just as we did in [GPE], after the marathon bombing, we are going to go to a ballgame. And do all the other things that make our life worthwhile. And you have nothing to offer. That is the message of resilience that we do not panic, that we do not fear. We will hunt you down and we will get you. [DATE], you said that [PERSON] private e-mail server did not jeopardize national secrets. I can tell that you this is not a situation in which [GPE]'s national security was endangered. Since then, we have learned that [CARDINAL] 000 of her e-mails contained classified material, [CARDINAL] of the e-mails had top-secret information. Can you still say flatly that she did not jeopardize [GPE]'s secrets? I have got to be careful because, as you know, there have been investigations, there are hearings, [ORG] is looking at this. And I have not been sorting through each and every aspect of this. Here is what I know: [PERSON] was an outstanding Secretary of [ORG]. She would never intentionally put [GPE] in any kind of jeopardy. And what I also know, because I handle a lot of classified information, is that there are -- there is classified, and then there is classified. There is stuff that is really top secret top secret, and there is stuff that is being presented to the president or the secretary of [ORG], that you might not want on the transom, or going out over the wire, but is basically stuff that you could get in open source. But [DATE], you were prepared to say, She has not jeopardized. Yes. Well -- And the question is, can you still say that? I continue to believe that she has not jeopardized [GPE]'s national security. Now what I have also said is that -- and she has acknowledged -- that there is a carelessness, in terms of managing e-mails, that she has owned, and she recognizes. But I also think it is important to keep this in perspective. This is somebody who has served her country for [DATE] as secretary of [ORG], and did an outstanding job. And no one has suggested that in some ways, as a consequence of how she is handled e-mails, that that detracted from her excellent ability to carry out her duties. [INTERVIEWED], when you say what you have just said, when [PERSON] said, as he did -- your spokesman -- in [DATE], the information from [ORG] is she is not a target, some people I think are worried whether or not -- the decision whether or not, how to handle the case, will be made on political grounds, not legal grounds. Can you guarantee to the [NORP] people, can you direct [ORG] to say, [PERSON] will be treated -- as the evidence goes, she will not be in any way protected. I can guarantee that. And I can guarantee that, not because I give Attorney General [PERSON] a directive, that is institutionally how we have always operated. I do not talk to the Attorney General about pending investigations. I do not talk to [ORG] directors about pending investigations. We have a strict line, and always have maintained it, previous president. So, just to button this up -- I guarantee it. You -- I guarantee that there is no political influence in any investigation conducted by [ORG], or the [ORG], not just in this case, but in any case. And she will be -- Full stop. Period. And she will be treated no different -- Guaranteed. Full stop. Nobody gets treated differently when it comes to [ORG], because nobody is above the law. Even if she ends up as the [NORP] nominee? How many times do I have to say it, [PERSON]? Guaranteed. Finally, we have seen in this campaign, I think both on the -- among some [INTERVIEWED] voters, and among some [PERSON] voters -- anger -- Yes. -- about [GPE], about Wall Street. Do you feel any personal responsibility that [DATE] after you came into office, there are [CARDINAL] of people out there who still feel cut out -- Yes. -- from the decisions that affect their lives? Well, there is no doubt that I feel frustrated about it. My whole, you know, operating assumption, in terms of our democracy, is the more people are involved, the more they know, the more they are involved, the more responsive our government is. So why do all these people, [NORP] and [NORP]? Yes, I think that, I think it comes out of a couple things, [PERSON]. Number [CARDINAL], we are still shell-shocked from what happened in [DATE]. We have now had [DATE] straight of job growth, and cut the unemployment rate down to [PERCENT]. But, people lost homes, lost jobs, lost life savings. And they still do not fully know how that happened, and was the system fixed in a way that they can have confidence in. I also think that -- So, have you fixed that in [DATE]? Well, actually we have done a better job than I think most people give us credit for. I do not mean fixed the system. Yes. I mean fixed the perception. Well, the perception is going to be changing over time, as people see results, as they get more confident. But, and this is the big but, nobody's going to be [PERCENT] satisfied -- in a democracy like ours -- with every outcome. And I think the danger, both among [NORP], and among [NORP], who increasingly just listen to each other. Or they just listen to people who already agree with them. [NORP], they have their own TV station. They are own radio -- Go ahead. You can say [ORG]. They have got their own publications, their own blogs. [NORP], same thing. Increasingly what happens is, we do not hear each other. And so what happens then is, when [NORP] promise to repeal [ORG], and it does not get repealed, they are outraged. Well, it must be because [NORP] were corrupt or unresponsive, or big money got involved. If [NORP] get frustrated, they say, Well, why did not we have a public option in our healthcare system? Or have a single payer system? Well, it turns out that [PERCENT] of people get healthcare through their jobs. They are pretty satisfied with it. They do not want big change on them. That is why it did not happen. It was not necessarily because there was some, you know, corruption, or venality, or that people were unresponsive to democracy. People disagree. I want, occasionally, people to step back and take a look. [GPE]'s got the best cards. We are the envy of the world. We have the most powerful military on earth, by [QUANTITY]. Our economy right now, is stronger than any other advanced economy. We have the best workers, we have the best universities. We are the most innovative. We have the most advanced scientific community. We have an incredibly diverse and talented population. This can be [DATE], just like [DATE] was, as long as we do not tear each other apart, because our politics value sensationalism or conflict, over cooperation, and we do not have the ability to compromise. And if we get that part right, nobody can stop us. [INTERVIEWED] -- I enjoyed it. -- thank you. Thank you so much, [PERSON]. Later in the program, we take a walk with the president as he discusses the highs and lows of [DATE] in office. And there is more from our sit-down with Mr. [PERSON] on our website, FoxNewsSunday.com. Up next, we will bring in our [DATE] group to discus what the president had to say. Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about whether the [PERSON] case will be handled fairly by [ORG]? Just go to Facebook or Twitter and we may use your question on the air. Here is what I know: [PERSON] was an outstanding secretary of state. She would never intentionally put [GPE] in any kind of jeopardy. President [PERSON] in our exclusive interview doubling down on his defense of [PERSON] in the private e-mail scandal. A look outside the beltway at [ORG], where we sat down [DATE] with President [PERSON]. And we are back now with more of our exclusive conversation with the president. We talked with Mr. [PERSON] in the library at the law school where he taught for [DATE]. He reminisced about that and a presidency that is winding down. Since I am sure this is a sentimental journey for you, I'd like to do a lightning round -- Sure. [DATE]. Quick questions, quick answers. Yes. Best day in [ORG]? [DATE] that we passed health care reform. And we sat out on [FAC] with all the staff that had worked so hard on it and I -- I knew what it would mean for the families that I'd met who did not have health care. Worst day in [FAC]? [DATE] we traveled up to [GPE] after Sandy Hook. No explanation needed there. No. Biggest accomplishment? Saving the economy from a great depression. Worst mistake? Probably failing to plan for [DATE] after what I think was the right thing to do in intervening in [GPE]. What you are going to miss most when you leave office? Other than Air Force One? No, that is a -- that is a -- that is an answer. Yes. Well, you miss -- what I will miss most is the breadth of interactions you have with the [NORP] people. When you are president, you meet people from every walk of life, every region and it gives you a unique appreciation for this unbelievable country of ours. What you are looking forward to most when you leave office? Being able to take a walk outside. I -- I have to ask, with all due respect, when you look at yourself in the mirror, and you have got a little bit more gray hair than you had, and you look back over [DATE], has it been a tough job? Has it aged you? You know, I do not think it has aged me spiritually or mentally. Obviously, I have gotten older. But I suspect that in some ways the job may keep you younger just because [DATE] is a new challenge. It is fascinating. It is an extraordinary privilege. I, you know, I -- I have no doubt that when I leave the office, after [DATE], [DATE], [DATE], maybe [DATE], you will start realizing that day to day burdens that you are carrying and you will probably be a little bit lighter. But, on the other hand, the degree to which every part of you is tested and engaged, that keeps you young. Now, we have ended up here and there is a plaque. [PERSON], president of [GPE], senior lecturer at [ORG], wrote 'Dreams From My Father' in this office. How about that? It is true that I -- I got an offer to come. I could write and teach a seminar and eventually I end up teaching here at the university. Can -- can we go in? We -- we -- we should go in. I will tell you that it was pretty [NORP] then. Oh, my Lord. And it is pretty [NORP] now. This -- quite a journey from [FAC], starting here. The [FAC] -- the [FAC] has better light. It is got more room too. It is got a little more room. I do not even think I had a -- a plant. Partly because I do not have a green thumb and I -- I was sure -- You -- you do not -- Unlike [PERSON] with her garden, I was pretty sure that -- Yes. Given what Dreams From My Father, what was your dream back then? You certainly did not think president. Finishing. Finishing that book. Finishing the book. Because I was -- I was a -- I was past the deadline. So what would you tell -- if you could go back [DATE] in time -- that law professor? What would you tell him that he did not know about how the world works? Well, first of all, that law professors back then would think I was crazy saying that somehow you might end up being president. You know what? What I would tell him is what I was telling some of those law students downstairs, that for all the frustrations of democracy and all the contention, it is not always a straight line, but if you put your shoulder to the wheel and you have faith in our democracy and our system, it works. So it is more complicated than people would have understood then? Absolutely. And, you know, I think that when you are outside of the system, you are properly outraged at this ineptitude of the government or this corruption or this issue that you feel deeply about. When you are in it, what you realize is, is that if you follow this process, if you are respectful of this process, then we can sort it out. And not everybody's going to be completely happy with it. But it will beat any other system given that we are human and given original sin. You know, this is going to work about as well as it can. [INTERVIEWED], thank you. Thank you. Thanks for talking with us. Enjoyed you bringing me back here.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithnadiabilbassychartersalarabiyatelevision0", "text": "[INTERVIEWED], thank you very much for your time, as always, and thank you for the interview. Thank you. The major obstacle to peace is the settlement activities. Would you request from Prime Minister [PERSON] a freeze on the settlements? I think the major obstacle to peace is going to be the politics of both [NORP] and [NORP] trying to take advantage of the difficult work that these [CARDINAL] leaders are going to have to do to define a state; that is what I think. I think that extremists, in some instances, will try to stop the peace. I believe there is a lot of forces at play in [GPE] that will try to stop these [CARDINAL] men from defining what a state will look like. And my job is to help them stay on the big picture and have the confidence necessary to make tough decisions. No question, the settlement activity is a problem. But there is a mechanism to deal with that, and that is [ORG], for the best word-is the trilateral commission, which we head, to deal with these roadmap issues. Now, we can solve those-we can work through those problems, but the key is to define a state. Now is the time. And I believe it is going to get done before my Presidency is over. And the reason I believe it is because these [CARDINAL] men, with whom I have spent a fair amount of time, are committed. The state will come into being subject to a roadmap. But the first step is to define what is possible; here is what a state will look like. And that is very important for both the [NORP] and the [NORP]. Well, in this case, what is exactly your strategy to implement your vision of a [NORP] state by [DATE]? Well, the key is for me to convince the [CARDINAL] leaders to work through the hard issues. I will help them, but in order for there to be lasting peace, they have got to come to the table; they have got to negotiate it. And what ends up happening in this process is that the leaders will commit, and then they will get their committees to work, and it gets stuck. And that is when I will have to work with [PERSON] to unstick it, just to keep it moving. [CARDINAL] thing is, is that they know that they have got a good partner in peace in me. They also know that I am not going to be in office [DATE], so there is a certain urgency to get this state defined. And my trip is going to be to just kind of keep momentum. The [GPE] conference was a successful conference for [CARDINAL] reasons: [CARDINAL], it was a chance for the [NORP] and the [NORP] to know that [GPE] is serious about helping them, and equally importantly, it gave the world a chance to come to the table. The rest of the Middle East was there, and that is an important movement. It is going to be important for both [GPE] and the [NORP] to know that an agreement they reach will be supported by the Middle East. And so part of my-one of the goals of my trip is to remind our friends and allies in the Middle East that they have got to be supportive of the Middle East peace process as well. They are going to want to know whether or not I am going to push. And I am going to want to know- and I am going to tell them, yes, I am, but we expect you to be constructive players too. Exactly, but, I mean, can you elaborate a little bit about this? I mean, what more can you do? I mean, support is enough? I mean, [CARDINAL] visit is enough? Will you be involved-- But you see, to get it to this place-I mean, a visit is important, but I am on the phone a lot, and [PERSON] is on the phone a lot. There is a little-look, visits are important, obviously. And there is a reason why the timing of this visit is what it is. I mean, there was an intifada when I first came into office. Secondly, the- that there is a philosophical change about a [CARDINAL]-state solution. I mean, I supported it as the first [NORP] President ever to support it. The [NORP], under [PERSON], came to the conclusion that this is in their interests. We are pushing a lot, let me put it to you that way. I repeat to you, though, that the notion that somehow [GPE] can impose its will on [CARDINAL] parties, I do not think it works. I think the-[GPE] can facilitate. And so you just got to-I hope that as a result of this interview and my trip, the people come away with the notion that [PERSON] understands now is the time to move. I mean, people know that you are close friend of [GPE]. What would you want to do to win hearts and minds of the [NORP], to assure them that [GPE] is a fair broker in the peace process? You know, I have heard that. I have heard that, Well, [PERSON] is so [NORP] he does not -he cannot possibly care about the plight of the [NORP] person. I would hope that my record, one of liberation and-liberation, by the way, not only from dictatorship, but from the disease around the world, like HIV/AIDS or malaria-is one that will say to people, he cares about the human condition, that he cares about each individual, that my religion teaches me to love your neighbor. I have spoken clearly about my belief that-I believe-I pray to the same God as a [NORP] prays-that the freedom agenda is really aimed at liberating people, and that the hope is, is that there will be an active, real [NORP] state so people can realize their dreams. But they are going to have to be-they are going to have to do some work. They are going to have to have security forces that protect the average person. They are going to have to have institutions that bring confidence for the [NORP]. They have to have the ability to attract investment. The [NORP] are great entrepreneurs, and if just given a chance, I am confident the business community will flourish. And most importantly, though, they are going to have to reject the extremists who murder innocent people. And by the way, we are engaged in a great ideological struggle. Absolutely. I mean, in retrospect, would you regret not being involved earlier in the peace process, [DATE]? I think that you would find that I have been very much involved in the peace process when you look at the facts. I mean, attitudinal changes do not happen overnight. And the reason we have been able to have this successful conference in [GPE] is because people's attitudes lined up in-kind of in the same direction. There was common interests; common ground has been now recognized. The [CARDINAL]-state solution was not accepted for [DATE] So this is the right time, you say? --for [DATE] of my administration. It took a while to convince people that the [CARDINAL]-state solution was in the security interests of both parties. And plus, there was a couple of difficult-there was a difficult situation, the truth be known. [CARDINAL] was the intifada, which made it awfully hard to discuss peace at that time. The other was the [GPE] invasion. It just-it created the conditions that made it more difficult to get people's minds in the right place to begin the process. And so now I think we have got the stars lined up, and I think we got a shot, and I am going for it. Great. I know he is telling me-- You are fine. Go ahead. Thank you, sir. Part of the visit, as well, is [GPE] and [GPE]. What exactly do you want from [GPE] regarding [GPE]? And would you ask for their cooperation in case of a military strike? First of all, I will assure [GPE] that I believe we can solve this problem diplomatically. Secondly, will-they are going to want more from me than I am going to want from them. They are going to want to know what this NIE was all about. Exactly. And I am going to remind them that at my press conference when I explained the NIE, I clearly said, [GPE] was, is, and will be a danger if they are allowed to enrich, because they can take the knowledge on how to enrich and convert it to a covert program. If they have had [CARDINAL]-a program once, they can easily start a program. And so I view the [NORP] regime as a danger. I also believe that the [NORP] people are not bad-they are good people-and that they can have a better way forward. We will tell our-I am sure the-our friends and allies will say: Well, what are you going to do about it? It is [CARDINAL] thing to define the problem, do you have a strategy? And if you say you can solve it diplomatically, what is your strategy? And I will explain the strategy of economic isolation, that-you know, it is sad; we really do not need to have to be in this position. If [ORG] would suspend their enrichment programs, like the international community has demanded, there is a better way forward for them. But they say that they need this program. And my answer is, is that if you need it, then why have not you been transparent and disclosed it and honest about it? And what were you doing with a military-secret military program in the first place? And so I view [GPE] as a danger; I truly do. And I do not view the people as a danger, I view the Government as a danger. Of course. But will it be harder for you to try to convince [GPE] what-the [NORP] position after the intelligence report? The fact that I am having to explain it means it is harder after the report. But I believe I will be able to convince them. What they want to know is whether or not I think they are a danger. They know [GPE] can be a danger. They want to know whether I think it is a danger and are we committed to helping people achieve security. And part of the trip is to tell people, yes, we have got-we are engaged to help you, if you want our help to enhance security. Now, look, nobody wants to be dictated to, and I am certainly not going to do that. I am there to reassure and to look people in the eye and say, I believe [GPE] is a threat, we have a strategy to deal with it, and we want to work with you. Did you ever discuss a military option with [GPE]? Will I ever do that? Did you, or will you? No, I have not , because I believe we can solve this diplomatically. On the other hand, as you have heard me say many times since you cover [ORG], that all options must be on the table in order to make sure diplomacy is effective. Absolutely. Secretary [PERSON] told [ORG] in an interview recently that the diplomatic option is still [PERCENT] in focus. Does that mean that you are going to still pressure [GPE] on the diplomatic front? And how far can you go before your patience will run out? Yes, definitely. We will continue to pressure them on the diplomatic front. And it is hard, because sometimes people are more interested in market share for their goods than they are for achieving peace. And so I have spent a lot of time with allies in Europe, for example, convincing them of the importance of working together to send a common message to the [NORP] regime. So yes, the diplomatic option is on the table, and it is active, and we are working hard. On the [GPE] issue-I do not know if I am allowed to ask one-- Keep going. I am sorry. All you got to do is ask; I will handle it. [Laughter] Thank you, sir. Thank you. On the [GPE] issue, I mean, we already talked about-you actually told me that you-patience with [PERSON] is running out. But we still have no [NORP] election. Yes. What does it mean? What can you do? Is it negotiation? Is it a military strike? Is it sanction against [GPE]? What can you do? Well, what we can do is make sure that the world understands our position and try to convince them that we ought to work together to say to the [NORP], let [PERSON] go forward. That is the President that the people want there in [GPE], and he ought to go forward. And that is going to be on my agenda when I talk to friends and allies in the Middle East, that-and we can collectively send the message to President [PERSON]. We have sanctioned [GPE], and I am looking at different ways to keep sending a tough message because, so far, he has shown no willingness to be constructive on [GPE] or in dealing with a militant [ORG] or in stopping suiciders from heading into Iraq- in other words, some reasonable things that we would like to see done in order to improve relations which he has not done. We are working very carefully-closely with the [NORP], for example. I have had a conversation with President [PERSON] on the subject. I will be talking to my friend King [PERSON] of [GPE] on the subject, who has got a very keen interest in seeing to it that the [NORP] democracy goes forward. And so we have got a very good chance to have a more focused, concerted, universal message that President [PERSON], I hope, will listen to. But some will say they might wait for [DATE] until you leave office, and then-- Well, he could try that. But in the meantime, there will be others around who he will have irritated as a result of his stubbornness. And so yes, I mean, he could try to wait me out, but there is other leaders in the world that are as equally concerned as I am about [GPE] not letting the Presidency go forward and really hurting this very important democracy in the Middle East. [GPE]'s survival as a democracy is, in my judgment, very important for the world. And [GPE] is-has been-when we passed the resolution out of [ORG], it worked. President [PERSON] and I worked together, got our foreign ministries working together, and it worked. And yet as opposed to honoring the notion of staying out of the-and to stop obstructing politics- [GPE] has just not been helpful at all. So will you impose sanction on [GPE]? We have already, and we are looking at different options, of course. A tougher sanction. Well, we are always looking for ways to make sure that we are effective. It is -sanctions, individual sanctions are okay. They are much more effective when they are -other people join along. President's Upcoming Visit to [GPE] Absolutely. To show that you actually supporting Prime Minister [PERSON], why not visiting [GPE] on this trip? Good question. You have to just-I have got only so much time. There is other countries I will not be going to either. We have had plenty of high-ranking officials go to support Prime Minister [PERSON]. I think about [PERSON], and I think about Admiral [PERSON], who I sent over there to help analyze what the [NORP] forces need. Listen, I was very impressed when Prime Minister [PERSON] made the decision to move [NORP] forces into the extremist stronghold and dealt with them. That is what you are supposed to do. And in order to have a safe and secure society, the state has got to show that it can provide security for the people and not tolerate pockets of extreme radicals who are murderous in their intentions, and he did. And right after that, I sent Admiral [PERSON] in to say, look, we need to help strengthen this man. He showed courage and leadership, and he needs to have a military that is able to function at the behest of a state to provide security. And so we are in the process of inventorying and analyzing and seeing how we can help from that perspective. But do you hope the election will go forward in [GPE]? Soon. I was hoping it would go forward [DATE]. They keep delaying it, and I am convinced a lot of it has to do with the fact that [GPE] is not helpful. And therefore, part of our strategy is to get others to send the same message that I have consistently been sending to President [PERSON]: If you want to be isolated, if you want to be-or if you want-you have a choice: Do you want to be isolated, or a part of the world? You can make the choice. You can hang out with a limited number of friends, like [GPE], or you can have better relations in the neighborhood and in the world. It is your choice to make. Step [CARDINAL] is to get out of the way of these Presidential elections. They have got a good candidate. A lot of people agree that this is the person, and now [GPE] needs to get out of the way. Sir, on the [GPE] issue, the security has improved. Does that mean you are going to withdraw troops by [DATE]? Our troops decisions will be made based upon the considered recommendations of our commanders. And success in [GPE] is essential, and therefore, I will make the decisions along with those recommendations based upon success. The surge has been successful. The economy is getting better, and the politics is getting better. There is still a lot of work to be done, however, and I am-you know what thrills me the most is that the average [NORP]'s life is becoming more hopeful. Here is what I tell people. I tell people here in [GPE] that an [NORP] mother wants the same thing for her children that an [NORP] mother wants: the chance for that child to grow up in peace and to realize dreams; a chance for the child to go outside and play and not fear harm. And it is beginning to happen. The average-you know, it is still tough. There is still too many suiciders, but the level of violence is declining. I did not see this, but I was told that the celebrations at New Year's Eve in [GPE] were festive. And life is coming back, and it is -that is exciting to me. And just to follow up on that, the generals were saying that [GPE] and [GPE] actually has been playing a role in stopping the suiciders of coming to [GPE]. Would you credit them for that at least? I am not willing to credit the [NORP] yet. I do not have enough evidence. [CARDINAL] general said that, then he corrected his story. I think so long as we are finding sophisticated IEDs-that could only have been manufactured in [GPE], that are killing innocent people inside [GPE]-that is cause for concern. I am willing to have dialogues with the [NORP] about [GPE] in [GPE], but our message will be, if we catch you providing arms and trained-training people, then we will -we are going to hold them to account. You just got to understand that. I would give-if, in fact, [GPE] is trying to stop suiciders, I will give them credit, of course. I hope that is the case. It is certainly [CARDINAL] way to begin to earning better relations with [GPE], is to stop the exportation of suiciders who go kill innocent people. And I am looking forward to the trip. I am glad you are going. Me too. Finally, how do you want the people in the Middle East to remember you, sir? History is odd. I will be long gone before the true history of the [PERSON] administration is written. I am still reading analyses of [PERSON] Presidency. I would hope, at least, at the very minimum, people would say that [PERSON] respected my religion and has great concern for the human condition; that he hurts when he sees poverty and hopelessness; that he is a realistic guy, because he understands that the only way that these extremists who murder the innocent can recruit is when you find-when they find hopeless situations-they have no vision that is positive; and that he helped present an alternative, and that was one based upon liberty and the rights of men and women in a just and free society. That is how I hope you remember me. Thank you very much, sir, for your time and for your generosity. Thank you very much.", "discourse_type": 1}

INTERVIEWED: Okay. INTERVIEWER: Mr. [PERSON], thank you for joining us. INTERVIEWED: Thank you very much. INTERVIEWER: We appreciate you taking the time, and we appreciate your commitment to answer our questions. INTERVIEWED: Sure. INTERVIEWER: We really appreciate that. Over [DATE], I have heard you talk about your adherence to a philosophy called positive thinking. Is this the mantra that if you believe something, if you visualize it, then it will happen? INTERVIEWED: To an extent. I also think in terms of the downside. I do. I have been given a lot of credit for positive thinking, but I also think about downside because only a fool does not . INTERVIEWER: To what extent do you think that that positive thinking mindset is suitable to handling the worst pandemic that we have seen in [DATE]? INTERVIEWED: I think you have to have a positive outlook. Otherwise, you would have nothing without a positive outlook. I think we have done an incredible job, between the ventilators and stopping very infected people from [GPE] coming in, meaning putting the ban on [GPE], which frankly nobody wanted me to do, practically nobody because it was very early in [DATE]. Then putting the ban on Europe, not an easy thing to do. When you put a ban on Europe, that is a big thing. We would have probably lost [CARDINAL] of lives more had I not done that. INTERVIEWED: And all of the experts, every [CARDINAL] of them, not [CARDINAL] of them wanted to do it. They thought it was too severe. [DATE], they are all saying, I am glad you did it. INTERVIEWER: The criticism of you that is most prominent, is about the communication. It is the public health experts saying that it needs to be based in reality. And they are saying that the wishful thinking and the salesmanship is just not suitable in a time when the pandemic has killed [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [NORP]. And I understand what you are saying, that people need to hear positive thinking, but for [DATE] it is been, the virus is totally under control, and the cases have been going up and the deaths have been going up. INTERVIEWED: Look, look. INTERVIEWER: But you have been saying it is under control. INTERVIEWED: Nobody knew what this thing was all about. This has never happened before. [DATE], but it was a totally different, it was a flu in that case. Okay? But other than [DATE], there is never been anything like this. And by the way, if you watch the fake news on television, they do not even talk about it. But you know, there are [CARDINAL] of the countries right now that are suffering, some proportionately far greater than we are. Okay? As bad as we are. INTERVIEWER: Very few. INTERVIEWED: Some proportionately greater than we are. Right now, right now, [GPE] is having a big spike. There are tremendous problems in the world. You look at [GPE], look at what is going on with [GPE]. Look at [GPE], look at these countries what is going on. This was sent to us by [GPE], [CARDINAL] way or the other, and we are never going to forget it. Believe me, we are never going to forget it. INTERVIEWED: And we were beating [GPE] at every single point. We were beating them on trade, we were making progress like nobody's ever made progress. Before the pandemic, they had the worst year, [PERSON], that they have had in [DATE]. You know that. With the tariffs and everything else I did, we would taking in [MONEY]. I was giving some of it to the farmers. The farmers were doing well because they were targeting the farmers, I was targeting [GPE]. We were doing good. INTERVIEWED: Then all of a sudden, the game changed, and I had to close it down. I closed down the greatest economy ever in history. INTERVIEWER: I- INTERVIEWED: Well, wait. And then, I closed it down. And now we are opening it. And we saved, by the way, by closing it down, we saved [CARDINAL] of lives. If we would have gone to herd and we knew very little about the disease, if we would've gone herd, we would have lost [CARDINAL] of people, [CARDINAL] of people. [CARDINAL] person's too much. We are at [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] people. [CARDINAL] person is too much. We are at [CARDINAL]. We would have lost [CARDINAL] of people. And those people that really understand it, they really understand it. They said, it is incredible the job that we have done. And again, I bring it up, the ban- INTERVIEWER: Who says that? INTERVIEWED: Banning [GPE] from coming in far earlier- INTERVIEWER: But it was already in here. INTERVIEWED: What is that? INTERVIEWER: It was already here. By the time you banned [GPE], it came in through Europe. INTERVIEWED: Nobody knew the extent. Nobody knew how contagious it was. You know What? Maybe [GPE] knew. INTERVIEWER: But the question is, Mr. President, by [DATE] we knew things were bad. And the last time I was with you was [DATE] before your [GPE] rally in the [FAC], and you were saying big, huge crowd, it was endorsed. These people, they listen to you. INTERVIEWED: By the way, [crosstalk [TIME]] Excuse me, [PERSON], we had a [CARDINAL] seat stadium and first of all, we had [CARDINAL] 000 people, not [CARDINAL], which you reported and other people reported. But you could not even get in. It was like an armed camp. INTERVIEWER: Why would you want it that? INTERVIEWED: Because they had [CARDINAL] [ORG] people there and Tulsa- INTERVIEWER: I understand but why would you have wanted a huge crowd? INTERVIEWED: Excuse me, wait. And [GPE], well, because that area was a very good area at the time. It was an area that was pretty much over. [crosstalk 00:05:55] After, after, [DATE], it started going up. That is [DATE], but [GPE] was a very good, [GPE] was doing very well as a state. It was almost free. It spiked [DATE], [DATE], [DATE]. But it was a good area. INTERVIEWED: We had a tremendous crowd, we had tremendous response. It was like an armed camp. You could not even get through. You could not get anybody in. But we had [CARDINAL] people. It was incorrectly reported. The other thing we had that nobody wants to talk about, so [ORG] broadcast it. It was the highest rating in the history of [ORG] television [DATE] [TIME]. It was the highest rating. INTERVIEWER: Mr. President- INTERVIEWED: Well, wait [TIME]. You are saying something. That speech was the highest rated speech in the history of [ORG] television on [DATE] [TIME]. And nobody says that. INTERVIEWER: I think you misunderstand me. I am not criticizing your ability to draw a crowd. Are you kidding me? I have covered you for [DATE]. You draw massive crowds. You get huge ratings. I am asking about the public health INTERVIEWED: I am just saying this. I am just saying this. At the time And I canceled another one. I had to cancel it and we were going to have a great crowd in [GPE], and I canceled it for the same reason. INTERVIEWER: But here is the question. I have covered you for a long time. I have gone to your rallies. I have talked to your people. They love you. They listen to you. They listen to every word you say, they hang on your every word. They do not listen to me or the media or [PERSON]. They think we are fake news. They want to get their advice from you. And so, when they hear you say, everything's under control, do not worry about wearing masks. I mean, these are people, many of them are older people, Mr. [PERSON]. INTERVIEWED: Well, what is your definition of control? INTERVIEWER: It is giving them a false sense of security. INTERVIEWED: Yeah. Under the circumstances right now, I think it is under control. I will tell you what- INTERVIEWER: How? [CARDINAL] [NORP] are dying a day. INTERVIEWED: They are dying. That is true. And it is what it is. But that does not mean we are not doing everything we can. It is under control as much as you can control it. This is a horrible plague that beset us. INTERVIEWER: You really think this is as much as we can control it? [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] deaths a day? INTERVIEWED: Well, I will tell you, I'd like to know if somebody First of all, we have done a great job. We have gotten the governors everything they needed, they did not do their job. Many of them did not and some of them did. Someday we will sit down. We will talk about the successful ones, the good ones. Look at that smile. The good ones and the bad. We had good and bad. And we had a lot in the middle, but we had some incredible governors. I could tell you right now who the great ones are and who the not so great ones are, but the governors do it. We gave them massive amounts of material. INTERVIEWER: Mr. President, you changed your message [DATE], in terms of you canceled the [GPE] convention, you said, Wear a mask. You are saying that, It is going to get worse before it gets better. It is not something you'd like to say, I know. And you said that. The big question- INTERVIEWED: By the way, not get worse like the original flow. You understand that. INTERVIEWER: Well, I hope not. It is a 1, 000- INTERVIEWED: But If you look, [GPE]'s going down. [GPE] is going down, and [GPE] is going down. INTERVIEWER: If I could just finish my question. The question is, even some of your own aides wonder whether you would stick to that message until [DATE], whether in [DATE] or [CARDINAL], you will not say, Right, we have got to reopen again. We cannot do this stuff anymore. That you will get bored of talking about the virus and go back to that sort of cheerleading. INTERVIEWED: No, I am not going to get bored. I never get bored of talking about this, it is too big a thing. INTERVIEWER: So will you stick to that message? INTERVIEWED: And again, it should have been stopped by [GPE], and it was not . INTERVIEWER: But now it is here and you are the President. INTERVIEWED: We have it here. No, I think I am very consistent. No, this is a very serious thing. We have [CARDINAL] 000 people at this moment. INTERVIEWER: More than that. INTERVIEWED: This is a very, very serious situation. And what you have to do, is handle it the best it can be handled. And again, I am working with the governors. I got them tremendous amounts of equipment that they would have never gotten. [PERSON], they would not have equipment now, if I did not get. INTERVIEWER: When can you commit, by what date, that every [NORP] will have access to the [DATE] testing that you get here in [FAC]? INTERVIEWED: Well, we have great testing. We are doing and many other people do- INTERVIEWER: By what date? INTERVIEWED: Let me explain the testing. We have tested more people than any other country, than all of Europe put together times [CARDINAL]. We have tested more people than anybody ever thought of. [GPE] has [CARDINAL] people. They have done [CARDINAL] tests. We have done [CARDINAL], it'll be close to [CARDINAL] tests. And there are those that say, you can test too much. You do- INTERVIEWED: And there are those that say you can test too much. You do know that. INTERVIEWER: Who says that? INTERVIEWED: Oh, just read the manuals, read the books. INTERVIEWER: Manuals? INTERVIEWED: Read the books. Read the books. INTERVIEWER: What books? INTERVIEWED: What testing does- INTERVIEWER: Wait [TIME]. I am sorry. INTERVIEWED: Let me explain. What testing does, it shows cases. It shows where there may be cases. Other countries test you know when they test? They test when somebody is sick. That is when they test. And I am not saying they are right or wrong. Nobody has done it like we have done it. We have gotten absolutely no credit for it. But we have come up with so many different tests. The only thing that we have now is some people have to wait longer than we'd like them to. We want it- INTERVIEWER: That is a big problem. INTERVIEWED: We want point to point. We want to have a [TIME] to a [TIME] test. INTERVIEWER: Right. When do you think- INTERVIEWED: And we have and like many others- INTERVIEWER: Every American- INTERVIEWED: And, from what I understand, we are [PERCENT] where it is point to point tests. We are making [CARDINAL] of instruments, [CARDINAL] of tests right now, [CARDINAL] that can be distributed to various parts of the country. But you have to understand. And we have even sent some of them to other countries where they had a big problem. [PERSON], [PERCENT], in fact, I think the number might be over, is immediate testing. The other is tough. You take a test. You have to send it to a laboratory. Let us say that takes [DATE]. Let us say it is [DATE]. INTERVIEWER: Right. It is difficult. INTERVIEWED: So, it is [DATE] or [DATE]. INTERVIEWER: I understand. INTERVIEWED: There is nothing you can do about that. INTERVIEWER: But when do you think you will have it for everyone? What day? INTERVIEWED: I think that you will have that relatively soon. I mean- INTERVIEWER: What does that mean? INTERVIEWED: You already have [CARDINAL]. INTERVIEWER: Yeah. INTERVIEWED: I would much rather get back to you. INTERVIEWER: Okay. That is fine. INTERVIEWED: Because I do not want to have you write in [DATE], I did not make it. INTERVIEWER: That is fine. INTERVIEWED: I missed it by [DATE]. INTERVIEWER: Yeah. I get it. INTERVIEWED: And it is a headline. INTERVIEWER: Mr. [PERSON], I want to talk about the federal intervention. INTERVIEWED: Excuse me. [CARDINAL] thing I would say about testing. INTERVIEWER: Yeah. Yeah. INTERVIEWED: Because we test so much, we show cases. So, we show many, many cases. We show tremendous number of cases. I know you are smiling when I say that, but I am telling you. INTERVIEWER: Well, I mean, I have heard you say this. INTERVIEWED: I know. Other countries do not test like we do. So, they do not show case. INTERVIEWER: Just a couple points on that. I was not going to continue on the testing, but you said it. So, we are testing so much because it is spread so far in [GPE]. And, when you- INTERVIEWED: We are testing so much because we had the ability to test. INTERVIEWER: Okay. INTERVIEWED: Because we came up with test- INTERVIEWER: But [GPE] INTERVIEWED: [PERSON], we did not even have a test. When I took over, we did not even have a test. Now, in all fairness- INTERVIEWER: Why would you have a test? INTERVIEWED: There was no test for this- INTERVIEWER: The virus did not exist. INTERVIEWED: Excuse me. I was going to say- INTERVIEWER: Okay. INTERVIEWED: There was no test for this. We did not have a test because there was no test. INTERVIEWER: Of course. INTERVIEWED: And, in a very short order, we got [CARDINAL] test. We got another test. INTERVIEWER: It was broken, the first one. INTERVIEWED: We got another. Many of those tests are now obsolete because it is called science. INTERVIEWER: Right. INTERVIEWED: And, all of a sudden, something is better. But, because we tested so many people, [CARDINAL] people, very soon, we get cases. You test. Some kid has even just a little runny nose. It is a case. And then, you report many cases. So, we look like we have more cases than massive countries like [GPE], which by the way, does not report, as you know. INTERVIEWER: Well, I do not put any stock in [GPE]'s figures. INTERVIEWED: No. No. The point is- INTERVIEWER: Yeah. INTERVIEWED: The point is, because we are so much better at testing than any other country in the world, we show more cases. INTERVIEWER: The figure I look at is death. And death is going up now. INTERVIEWED: Okay. No, no. INTERVIEWER: It is [CARDINAL] a day. INTERVIEWED: If you look at death- INTERVIEWER: Yeah. It is going up again. INTERVIEWED: Let us look. Let us look. INTERVIEWER: [DATE] death. INTERVIEWED: Take a look at some of these charts. INTERVIEWER: I'd love to. INTERVIEWED: We are going to look. INTERVIEWER: Let us look. INTERVIEWED: And, if you look at death per- INTERVIEWER: Yeah. It is started to go up again. INTERVIEWED: Here is one. Well, right here, [GPE] is lowest in numerous categories. We are lower than the world. INTERVIEWER: Lower than the world? INTERVIEWED: We are lower than Europe. INTERVIEWER: What does that mean? In what? In what? INTERVIEWED: Look. Take a look. Right there. Here is case death. INTERVIEWER: Oh, you are doing death as a proportion of cases. I am talking about death as a proportion of population. That is where the [GPE] is really bad, much worse than [GPE], [GPE], et cetera. INTERVIEWED: You cannot do that. INTERVIEWER: Why cannot I do that? INTERVIEWED: You have to go by where look. Here is [GPE]. You have to go by the cases. The cases are there. INTERVIEWER: Why not as a proportion of population? INTERVIEWED: What it says is, when you have somebody where there is a case- INTERVIEWER: Oh, okay. INTERVIEWED: The people that live from those cases. INTERVIEWER: Oh. It is surely a relevant statistic to say, if the [GPE] has X population and X percentage of death of that population versus [GPE] INTERVIEWED: No. Because you have to go by the cases. INTERVIEWER: Well, look at [GPE], for example. [CARDINAL] population, [CARDINAL] deaths. It is like, it is crazy compared to- INTERVIEWED: You do not know that. INTERVIEWER: I do. INTERVIEWED: You do not know that. INTERVIEWER: You think they are faking their statistics, [GPE]? An advanced country? INTERVIEWED: I will not get into that because I have a very good relationship with the country. INTERVIEWER: Yeah. INTERVIEWED: But you do not know that. And they have spikes. Look, here is [CARDINAL] of- INTERVIEWER: [GPE], low [CARDINAL]. INTERVIEWED: Here is [CARDINAL]. Here is [CARDINAL] right here, [GPE]. INTERVIEWER: Let me look. INTERVIEWED: You take the number of cases. INTERVIEWER: Okay. INTERVIEWED: Now look, we are last meaning we are first. INTERVIEWER: Last? I do not know what we are first in. INTERVIEWED: We have the best. INTERVIEWER: As a what? INTERVIEWED: Take a look again. It is cases. INTERVIEWER: Okay. I will just okay. INTERVIEWED: And we have cases because of the testing. INTERVIEWER: I mean, [CARDINAL] [NORP] die a day. But I understand. I understand on the cases, it is different. INTERVIEWED: No, but you are not reporting it correctly, [PERSON]. INTERVIEWER: I think I am, but- INTERVIEWED: If you take a look at this other chart look, this is our testing. I believe this is the testing. Yeah. INTERVIEWER: Yeah. We do more tests. INTERVIEWED: No, wait [TIME]. Well, do not we get credit for that? And, because we do more tests, we have more cases. In other words, we test more. We have now, take a look. The top one, that is a good thing not a bad thing. But the top Jonathan- INTERVIEWER: If hospitals rates were going down and deaths were going down, I'd say, terrific. You deserve to be praised for testing. INTERVIEWED: Well, they do not even- INTERVIEWER: But they are all going up. INTERVIEWED: Well, they very rarely talk- INTERVIEWER: Plus, [CARDINAL] [NORP] are in hospital, [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] dying a day. INTERVIEWED: If you watch the news or read the papers, they usually talk about new cases, new cases, new cases. INTERVIEWER: I am talking about death. INTERVIEWED: Well, you look at death. INTERVIEWER: It is going up. INTERVIEWED: Death is way down from where it was. INTERVIEWER: It is [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] a day. INTERVIEWED: Death- INTERVIEWER: It was [CARDINAL]. It went down to [CARDINAL]. Now, it is going up again. INTERVIEWED: Death excuse me. Where it was is much higher than where it is right now. INTERVIEWER: It went down and then it went up again. INTERVIEWED: It spiked, but now it is going down again. INTERVIEWER: It is going up. INTERVIEWED: It is gone down in [GPE]. It is going down in [GPE]. INTERVIEWER: nationally it is going up. INTERVIEWED: It is going down in [GPE]. Take a look at this. These are the tests. INTERVIEWER: It is going down in [GPE]? INTERVIEWED: Yeah. It leveled out and it is going down. That is my report, as of [DATE]. INTERVIEWER: Anyway, Mr. [PERSON], if I could change subjects. INTERVIEWED: It is going down in [GPE]. It is gong down in [GPE]. INTERVIEWER: [GPE] it is. [GPE] it is. [GPE] has big problems. INTERVIEWED: And it is spiked. It spiked and is now going down in [GPE]. It is evened out and going down in [GPE]. INTERVIEWER: I will have to see those figures. INTERVIEWED: But you have to look at this. This is the number of tests compared to the rest of the world. INTERVIEWER: I do not deny your figures. You have done more tests by far than the rest of the world. I do not deny that. INTERVIEWED: Right. And, because we have done more tests, we have more cases. INTERVIEWER: You have more infections. INTERVIEWED: Now, you can take them back. Check it out in your office. INTERVIEWER: Mr. President, different subject, it is been widely reported that the [GPE] has intelligence indicating that [GPE] paid bounties or offered to pay bounties to [ORG] fighters to kill [NORP] soldiers. INTERVIEWED: Right. Right. INTERVIEWER: You had a phone call with [PERSON] on [DATE]. Did you bring up this issue? INTERVIEWED: No. That was a phone call to discuss other things. And frankly, that is an issue that many people said was fake news. INTERVIEWER: Who said it was fake news? INTERVIEWED: I think a lot of people. If you look at some of the wonderful folks from [ORG], some of them, not any friends of mine, were saying that it is a fake issue. But a lot of people said, it is a fake issue. INTERVIEWER: There was dispute within intelligence. INTERVIEWED: But we had a call. We had a call talking about nuclear proliferation. INTERVIEWER: Right. INTERVIEWED: Which is a very big subject where they would like to do something. And so would I. We discussed numbers things. We did not discuss that. No. INTERVIEWER: And you have never discussed it with him. INTERVIEWED: I have never discussed it with him. No. I would. I'd have no problem with it. INTERVIEWER: But you do not believe the intelligence. INTERVIEWED: But you know it never got to- INTERVIEWER: It is because you do not believe the intelligence. That is why. INTERVIEWED: It is interesting. Nobody ever brings up [GPE]. They always bring [GPE], [GPE], [GPE]. If we can do something with [GPE] in terms of nuclear proliferation, which is a very big problem. INTERVIEWER: Right. INTERVIEWED: Bigger problem than global warming. INTERVIEWER: Right. INTERVIEWED: A much bigger problem than global warming in terms of the real world, that would be a great thing. No. It never reached my desk. INTERVIEWER: Okay. INTERVIEWED: You know why? Because intelligence, they did not think it was real. INTERVIEWER: It was in your written brief though about it. INTERVIEWED: They did not think it was worthy. I would not mind. If it reached my desk, I would have done something about it. It never reached my desk because- INTERVIEWER: Do you read your written brief? INTERVIEWED: I do. INTERVIEWER: Do you? INTERVIEWED: I read it a lot. INTERVIEWER: Really? INTERVIEWED: I read a lot. They like to say I do not read. I read a lot. INTERVIEWER: You read your [DATE] intelligence brief? INTERVIEWED: I comprehend extraordinarily well, probably better than anybody that you have interviewed in a long time. I read a lot. I spend a lot of time at meetings. Usually it is once a day or [CARDINAL] times a week, intelligence meetings. INTERVIEWER: Because this was apparently in your- INTERVIEWED: Talking about [GPE], talking about the problems with [GPE]. INTERVIEWER: Right. INTERVIEWED: Talking about so many different elements of the world. INTERVIEWER: Mm-hmm . INTERVIEWED: The world is a very angry place, if you look all over the world. We call up. I see a [CARDINAL] soldiers were killed in [GPE] with [GPE] fighting over the border. It is been raging for [DATE]. And they have been fighting and back and forth. I have so many briefings on so many different countries, but this one did not reach my desk. INTERVIEWER: The reason I say this is, even if you do not believe this particular piece of intelligence, and there is dispute, no doubt, there is dispute in the intelligence committee about it, [PERSON], former head of forces in [GPE] said, and this is when he was working for you, that [GPE] is supplying weapons to the [ORG]. Is not that enough to challenge [PERSON] over the killings of [GPE] soldiers? INTERVIEWED: Well, we sold them weapons when they were fighting [GPE] too. When they were fighting with the [ORG] in Afghanistan- INTERVIEWER: Yeah. But that is a different era. INTERVIEWED: Well, it is a different I am just saying. Yes. INTERVIEWER: But how does that affect- INTERVIEWED: I am just saying we did that too. INTERVIEWER: But how does that- INTERVIEWED: I do not know. I did not ask [PERSON] about that. He was there for a long time. Did not have great success because he was there before me. And then, ultimately, I made a change. INTERVIEWER: But you surely heard that. Right? I mean, it is well known in the intelligence community, that they are arming the [ORG], [GPE]. INTERVIEWED: I do not know. When you say arming is- INTERVIEWER: Supplying weapons. INTERVIEWED: Paying or they- INTERVIEWER: [GPE] is supplying weapons and money to the [ORG]. INTERVIEWED: I have heard that but, again, it is never reached my desk. INTERVIEWER: I mean, he said it on the record when he was in- INTERVIEWED: Hey, [GPE] does not want anything to do with [GPE]. Let me just say about [GPE]. [GPE] used to be a thing called [GPE]. Because of [GPE], they went bankrupt. They became [GPE], just so you do understand. Okay? The last- INTERVIEWED: Went bankrupt, they became [GPE], just so you do understand, okay? The last thing that [GPE] wants to do is get too much involved with [GPE]. They tried that once. It did not work out too well. INTERVIEWER: Last question on this subject. INTERVIEWED: And by the way, we are largely out of [GPE], as you probably know. INTERVIEWER: Well, I wanted to ask you about that. The [GPE] troop level in [GPE] right now is roughly the same as it was when you- INTERVIEWED: No, you are wrong. No. INTERVIEWER: Mr. President. I am sorry. We have to do- INTERVIEWED: Okay. Are you ready? INTERVIEWER: No, no. I need- INTERVIEWED: We will be down in a very short It is already planned. INTERVIEWER: Well, that is a different question. INTERVIEWED: Let me explain. We will be down in a very short period of time to [CARDINAL], then we are going to be down to [CARDINAL]. We are negotiating right now. We have been there for [DATE]. INTERVIEWER: I know. I know. INTERVIEWED: [DATE]. INTERVIEWER: But if you just let me finish my question. INTERVIEWED: We will be getting out. INTERVIEWER: I understand. Look, when you came in, it was [CARDINAL]. You boosted to [CARDINAL], and now you are back down to [CARDINAL]. INTERVIEWED: We are now- INTERVIEWER: My question to you- INTERVIEWED: We will be at [CARDINAL]. I will get you the exact- INTERVIEWER: When? INTERVIEWED: Very soon. Very soon. INTERVIEWER: What will be the number? Very soon? [CARDINAL]? INTERVIEWED: Very soon. Yeah, very soon. INTERVIEWER: Like how soon? INTERVIEWED: I do not want to tell you that. I do not want to tell you. INTERVIEWER: That is big news. INTERVIEWED: What is? That is [crosstalk [TIME]] INTERVIEWER: It is going down to [CARDINAL]. INTERVIEWED: I have always said- INTERVIEWER: Well, what about [DATE]? INTERVIEWED: We will get largely out- INTERVIEWER: On [DATE], how many [NORP] troops will be in [GPE]? INTERVIEWED: Probably [CARDINAL]. INTERVIEWER: That is almost as many as when you came into office. INTERVIEWED: No, it is not. We had- INTERVIEWER: [CARDINAL]. INTERVIEWED: We had much more. We had a lot of people over there too. INTERVIEWER: [CARDINAL] [crosstalk [TIME] troops. INTERVIEWED: A lot of people. And we did a good job. We wiped out [ORG]. Let me just tell you what you do not see. INTERVIEWER: Have you thought about going down to [CARDINAL]? INTERVIEWED: We took out, in [GPE], we took out [ORG]. We [PERCENT] of the caliphate. When I took over [PERSON], it was totally rampant. [ORG] was all over the place. We took them out. We captured them. We killed them [PERCENT], not [PERCENT]. I wanted to get out at [CARDINAL]. Everyone said, Oh, please, would you stay? I stayed. [PERCENT] was good, but [PERCENT] of the caliphate. INTERVIEWED: We took out [PERSON]. We took out [PERSON]. We took out people that nobody thought possible. [PERSON] was the biggest terrorist of them all. They could not find him. I took him out. [PERSON], even bigger. I took him out. I have done things that no other president's done. None. I mean, fortunately, not too many. They should have never been in the Middle East. The decision to go to the Middle East and get into the Middle East was the single biggest mistake made in the history of our country. That is my opinion. INTERVIEWER: You told [ORG] recently that you could not say whether you'd accept the results of the [DATE] election. What does that actually look like as the sitting president? I mean, it is unprecedented. What would that actually look like? INTERVIEWED: Well, [PERSON] never accepted them. INTERVIEWER: Well, she conceded on them. INTERVIEWED: I mean, she does not accept them and she got beaten very easily. INTERVIEWER: But that is the important point. That is the important point. She conceded on [DATE]. Now, she grumbled about it and said all sorts of- INTERVIEWED: Grumbled? Grumbled? She wrote books about it. INTERVIEWER: Okay, fine, she wrote books. INTERVIEWED: And do not use the word grumbled. INTERVIEWER: Fine. But- INTERVIEWED: She wrote books about it. INTERVIEWER: That is fine, but I just- INTERVIEWED: She got beaten easy. INTERVIEWER: I get it. I get it. INTERVIEWED: [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL]. That is a lot. That is a lot. INTERVIEWER: I am not disputing you beat [PERSON]. Listen, what of asking is you will be the sitting president in [ORG]. What does that look like not accepting- INTERVIEWED: I will tell you what it looks like. INTERVIEWER: Are you litigating? INTERVIEWED: Let me tell you what it looks. INTERVIEWER: Okay. INTERVIEWED: So we have a new phenomena. It is called mail-in voting, where you send, where a governor- INTERVIEWER: New? INTERVIEWED: Well, it is new- INTERVIEWER: It is been here since the Civil War. [NORP] have- INTERVIEWED: In terms of kind of the kind of [CARDINAL] of ballots. They have never done anything like that. INTERVIEWER: It will be bigger [DATE] because of the pandemic. INTERVIEWED: Bigger? Not bigger, massively bigger. INTERVIEWER: Yeah, because of the pandemic. INTERVIEWED: So they are going to send [CARDINAL] of ballots to [GPE], all over the place, to who is going to get them. I have a friend who lives in [GPE] INTERVIEWER: They send applications, not allots. INTERVIEWED: His son passed away. He had a beautiful, wonderful son. Young man. Passed away [DATE]. He called me, he said, I just got a ballot for my son, [PERSON]. INTERVIEWER: Probably an application. INTERVIEWED: He died [DATE]. Somebody got at ballot for a dog. Somebody got a ballot for something else. You got [CARDINAL] of ballots going, nobody even knows where they are going. You look at some of the corruption having to do with universal mail-in voting Absentee voting is okay. You have to apply, you have to go through a process. INTERVIEWER: You have to apply for mail-in. It is the same thing. INTERVIEWED: Absentee voting is good. Look, you are sending it out- INTERVIEWER: Let us do concrete. Let us do concrete. INTERVIEWED: [PERSON], they are sending out- INTERVIEWER: Applications. You download them off [crosstalk [TIME]] INTERVIEWED: Governors, [CARDINAL] of ballots. There is- INTERVIEWER: No, they are not. It is applications. You can get them off the internet. INTERVIEWED: There is no way you can go through a mail-in vote without massive cheating. INTERVIEWER: I honestly do not understand this topic with- INTERVIEWED: Go ahead. INTERVIEWER: [ORG] has an extremely well-funded vote by mail program. Your campaign puts out emails telling people to vote by mail. INTERVIEWED: Correct. INTERVIEWER: Your daughter-in-law, [PERSON], she did robocalls in [GPE] saying it is safe and secure, mail-in voting. INTERVIEWED: Let me tell you. We have no choice. INTERVIEWER: The [ORG] won. That was an all mail-in race. INTERVIEWED: Let me tell you. You ready? INTERVIEWER: Yeah. INTERVIEWED: We have no choice because right now, we have, but we have many court cases that we are waiting. We have [CARDINAL] filed in Western [GPE]. We have many court cases where we are trying to end it. We went through World War I, you went to the polls, you voted, we went through World War II, you went to the polls, you voted. INTERVIEWER: You have had mail-in voting since the Civil War. INTERVIEWED: And now because of the [GPE] virus, we are supposed to stay home, send [CARDINAL] of ballots all over the country, [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL]. You know, you could have a case where this election will not be decided on [TIME]. INTERVIEWER: Absolutely. What is wrong with that? INTERVIEWED: This election could be decided [DATE], INTERVIEWER: It will not be [DATE], but what is wrong with the proper mail-in count? INTERVIEWED: It could be decided [DATE]. INTERVIEWER: Have you discussed the- INTERVIEWED: You know why? Because lots of things will happen during that period of time. Especially when you have tight margins, lots of things can happen. There is never been anything like this when you try Now, of course, right now, we have to live with it, but we are challenging it in many courts, as you know, all over the country. INTERVIEWER: You are going to [crosstalk [TIME]]? Mr. President, [DATE], a reporter asked you about [PERSON]. You said, I just wish her well, frankly. I have met her numerous times over [DATE], especially since I lived in [GPE], but I wish her well, whatever it is. Mr. President, [PERSON] has been arrested on allegations of child sex trafficking. Why would you wish such a person well? INTERVIEWED: Well, first of all, I do not know that, but I do know this- INTERVIEWER: She has. She is been arrested for that. You know that. INTERVIEWED: Her friend or boyfriend- INTERVIEWER: [PERSON]. INTERVIEWED: Was either killed or committed suicide in jail. She is now in jail. Yeah, I wish you well, I'd wish you well, I'd wish a lot of people well. Good luck. Let them prove somebody was guilty. I mean, you do know that she [crosstalk [TIME]] INTERVIEWER: Oh. So you are saying you hope she does not die in jail? Is that what you mean by wish her well? INTERVIEWED: Well, her boyfriend died in jail and people are still trying to figure out how did it happened? Was it suicide? Was he killed? And I do wish her well. I am not looking for anything bad for her. I am not looking bad for anybody. And they took that and made it such a big deal- INTERVIEWER: I mean, she is a alleged child sex trafficker. INTERVIEWED: But all it is is her boyfriend died. He died in jail. Was he killed? Was it suicide? I do, I wish her well. INTERVIEWER: Let us move to [GPE]. I am sure you have seen the disturbing footage of people in fatigues beating the [ORG] veteran. INTERVIEWED: No, no, no, no, no, no. No. No. INTERVIEWER: Well, it is there. INTERVIEWED: here you go, the fake news. INTERVIEWER: It is not fake news, it is on video. INTERVIEWED: No, no. INTERVIEWER: Pepper spraying him. INTERVIEWED: For [DATE], these people were anarchists and agitators, and some protesters, but these were anarchists. These people were beating the hell out of the city. They were beating up our federal buildings and our federal courthouse. We told the police to stop it. You make sure. And the police would not do it. Not the police- INTERVIEWER: Your own justice department and [ORG] Inspector General- INTERVIEWED: Excuse me. INTERVIEWER: But your Inspector Generals are investigating unconstitutional- INTERVIEWED: You are trying now to blame law enforcement instead of anarchists- INTERVIEWER: I am not. INTERVIEWED: Instead of [ORG]. INTERVIEWER: I am not. INTERVIEWED: It is [ORG] and anarchists that are causing the problems, not law enforcement. Our law enforcement, if we did not have people at our courthouse, and they are strong, tough people, and they do not want They try and be very good, believe me. But if we did not have people there, you would have your federal courthouse, a [MONEY] building, you would have that thing burned to the ground right now. INTERVIEWER: I am asking you about tactics and about the unmarked vans where they are rounding people up. And I want to- INTERVIEWED: Okay, let me tell you about unmarked. INTERVIEWER: Can I just finish my question. INTERVIEWED: Well let me tell you about unmarked. INTERVIEWER: Could I just finish my question? Because it relates to this. I promise. This is from [PERSON]. We cannot give up liberty for security. Local law enforcement can and should be handling these situations in our cities, but there is no place for federal troops or unidentified federal agents rounding people up at will. What is your response to Senator [PERSON]? INTERVIEWED: First of all, these are [ORG] people. They are securing a courthouse. INTERVIEWER: They are border patrol. INTERVIEWED: They are [ORG]. INTERVIEWER: Elite units. INTERVIEWED: Border, hopefully they have [ORG] in there. INTERVIEWER: Camo< gas [inaudible [CARDINAL]]. INTERVIEWED: Hopefully they have [ORG]. Now, do you know why they are unmarked? INTERVIEWER: Why? INTERVIEWED: Because these terrorists, these [ORG] people, these people that are at anarchists and agitators, when they see the name on a uniform of a person, a policeman or a law enforcement person, they find out where that person lives. And then they go and they scare the hell out of the person's family. And so they do it for that reason. It is just common There is nothing secret about this. And you know it. INTERVIEWED: You see what is going on right now. We have [PERSON]. They have people. He is doing a fantastic job. He is the acting head. He is doing a fantastic job. [PERSON] has pickets and very dangerous looking people outside of his house. He is going to be just fine. He is tough and he is got people, but if you have the names on all of these uniforms, you will have these maniacs in front of their houses, scaring their family and their wives or husbands, whatever it may be. I think it is a very good reason not to have your name. Why should you have identification? My name is [PERSON] and here is where I live and I am a member of- INTERVIEWER: The really serious concern is the reports- INTERVIEWED: No, no, that is a serious concern. INTERVIEWER: No, no, not about that. The serious concern is the reports of people being rounded up and not being told why they are being detained. That is what is being investigated by- INTERVIEWED: Why? Why are they being detained? INTERVIEWER: Mr. [PERSON], the Inspectors Generals- INTERVIEWED: You know why? You know why they are being detained? Well, [crosstalk [TIME]]. INTERVIEWER: There is an investigation. Do you support that investigation? INTERVIEWED: Well, I have not seen the result yet. Let me see the result. INTERVIEWER: But you support the initiative of it? INTERVIEWED: No, I think that actually- INTERVIEWER: You do not ? INTERVIEWED: I think [ORG] should be investigated, not the law enforcement. They are investigating, think of [crosstalk [TIME]] INTERVIEWER: They should not be investigating? INTERVIEWED: Have you been watching television- INTERVIEWED: They are investigating- INTERVIEWER: They should not be investigating? INTERVIEWED: Have you been watching television? INTERVIEWER: I have. INTERVIEWED: Have you been seeing the violence? INTERVIEWER: Sure. INTERVIEWED: Now, if you watch [ORG] like I watch [ORG] fake news. I am watching it. [PERSON], real beauty. I am watching this [ORG] sham, and you have a mayor named [PERSON] and he is standing out there and he is being accosted by the people. You know that. I mean, it is horrible what they are doing to him in [GPE], the mayor of [GPE] and he thought he'd go out. He'd be a man. INTERVIEWED: What they were doing and saying, and everything else to him, I happened to watch it on a different station. He had to get out. He had [CARDINAL] security guards. INTERVIEWER: I saw it. INTERVIEWED: He got out with his life. Okay. INTERVIEWER: Mr. President- INTERVIEWED: Wait. If you watch [ORG], they make them like he is standing there bravely fighting with the people, in a positive sense, that everything is wonderful. INTERVIEWED: No. He went out there. He is lucky he got away with his life because they would've killed him. He had [CARDINAL] guards, but [ORG] showed it like he is standing with the people for justice. Look, those people, take a look at what they have done to the courthouse. Take a look at what they have done to the streets. Take a look at the violence. INTERVIEWER: It is getting worse since they have gone in. It is getting worse. INTERVIEWED: Actually, it is getting better. We had a very good We have arrested a lot of people and we now have a [DATE] rule. You try not to knock down our courthouse- INTERVIEWER: More businesses damaged, more violence- INTERVIEWED: You touch our courthouse, you go to jail for [DATE]. INTERVIEWER: Turning to the rest of the country, we have not seen protests like this since [DATE]. I mean, we are seeing- INTERVIEWED: These are [NORP]-run cities. INTERVIEWER: If I could finish my question. If I could finish my question. INTERVIEWED: And they are doing it for political reasons. INTERVIEWER: You said you have done so much for [NORP]. INTERVIEWED: I have. INTERVIEWER: But there are Americans- INTERVIEWED: Criminal justice reform, opportunity. INTERVIEWER: Yeah, I understand, but let me finish. There were [NORP] out in the streets asking for change. Mr. President, have you ever met with a Black Lives Matter activist to hear them out, hear their arguments? INTERVIEWED: Well, [ORG] started off to me very badly because it was- INTERVIEWER: Did you ever meet with one? INTERVIEWED: pigs in a blanket, burn them like bacon. That was the first time I ever of Black That was [DATE]. Pigs meaning policemen. Pigs is what they are referring to, in a blanket, fry them like bacon. So I got off to a bad start. I got off to a very bad start. INTERVIEWER: Would you meet with a- INTERVIEWED: And so did [crosstalk [CARDINAL]]. INTERVIEWER: Would you with a [ORG] activist? INTERVIEWED: I would. But I think right now when they paint- INTERVIEWER: Why have not you? INTERVIEWED: the sign. Nobody's asked for a meeting, right? I have never been, nobody's ever asked me for a meeting. Let me tell you with [NORP], I am doing very well. They had the best employment numbers they have ever had. They had the best job numbers they have ever had. They were making more money than they ever made. We were all set until we got hit by [GPE] with the virus. [PERSON], there was actually, we were becoming a very unified country. INTERVIEWER: Do you believe that- INTERVIEWED: Because of success. INTERVIEWER: I understand. Do you believe though, Mr. President, that many police treat black people differently from white people? INTERVIEWED: Well, I hope not. I hope not. Certainly the INTERVIEWER: You have seen the statistics. INTERVIEWED: The knee on the neck was a disgrace. Okay? INTERVIEWER: Yeah. INTERVIEWED: It was a disgrace. INTERVIEWER: I am talking about what does systemic racism mean to you? INTERVIEWED: I hope the answer to that question is no. Does anybody really answer that question accurately? Does anybody really know? INTERVIEWER: But what about not hope? What about analysis? What is your cold-hearted view of it? INTERVIEWED: I have seen where there is a difference and I do not want there to be a difference. I do not like that there would be a difference. But with that being said- INTERVIEWER: Why do you think [NORP] men are [CARDINAL] times- INTERVIEWED: Police have killed white people- INTERVIEWER: I know, but why do you think [NORP] men- INTERVIEWED: in larger number, police have killed white people. INTERVIEWER: In quantity, but why do you think [NORP] men are [CARDINAL] times more likely to be killed by police than white men? INTERVIEWED: That I do not know- INTERVIEWER: Why? INTERVIEWED: but I do not like it. INTERVIEWER: But you must've thought about it. INTERVIEWED: I do not know why, but I do not like it. I do know this- INTERVIEWER: Does it speak to something systemic? INTERVIEWED: that police have killed many white people also. INTERVIEWER: But proportionally, what does it speak to? INTERVIEWED: It speaks to something, if that is the number? INTERVIEWER: It is the number. INTERVIEWED: Okay. If that is the number, it speaks to something that to me is unacceptable. INTERVIEWER: And what do you do about it then? INTERVIEWED: Well, I think we have already done a lot of things- INTERVIEWER: But you have not , it still exists. INTERVIEWED: Let me just tell you. INTERVIEWER: No, no, I understand your achievements. I know what you are going to say. I am not suggesting you have not done a lot economically- INTERVIEWED: I have done a thing called criminal justice reform. INTERVIEWER: I get it, I am just saying what changes- INTERVIEWED: And your friend President [PERSON] could not get done. INTERVIEWER: He is not my friend. I am asking about a statistic. INTERVIEWED: He tried, but he could not get it done. I got criminal justice [crosstalk [TIME] INTERVIEWER: I get it. I get it. INTERVIEWED: I got opportunities on, I took care of the historically Black If you look at what I have done for colleges, for Black colleges and universities, I got them funding. [PERSON] never did it. I did more for the Black community than anybody with the possible exception of [PERSON], whether you like it or not. People say, Oh, that is interesting. INTERVIEWER: You really believe you did more than [PERSON] who passed the Civil Rights Act? INTERVIEWED: I think I did, yeah. INTERVIEWER: How? How possibly did you- INTERVIEWED: Because I got criminal justice reform done, I got prison reform- INTERVIEWER: [PERSON] INTERVIEWED: I have done things. Well- INTERVIEWER: He passed the Civil Rights Act. INTERVIEWED: Ask. Ask. How has it worked out? If you take a look at what [PERSON] did? INTERVIEWER: You think the Civil Rights Act was a mistake? INTERVIEWED: How has it worked out? Because frankly, it took a long time, but for [NORP] INTERVIEWER: But you think that was a mistake? INTERVIEWED: under my administration, [PERSON], under my administration, [NORP] were doing better than they have ever done in the history of this country. So I did a lot, job numbers, all of it, money. They had money, they were getting great. Their percentage was up, their housing ownership was up. They did better than they have ever done until we got hit- INTERVIEWER: I just do not know how you can- INTERVIEWED: and now you know what we are doing? I am building it up again. We are going to have it. [DATE] will be [DATE], unless it is screwed up by somebody that does not know what he is doing, which could happen, but I do not think it will. INTERVIEWER: [PERSON] is lying in state in [FAC]. How do you think history will remember [PERSON]? INTERVIEWED: I do not know. I really do not know. I do not know. I do not know [PERSON]. He chose not to come to my inauguration. He chose I never met [PERSON], actually, I do not believe. INTERVIEWER: Do you find him impressive? INTERVIEWED: I cannot say one or the other. I find a lot of people impressive. I find many people not impressive. But no, but I did not go- INTERVIEWER: Do you find his story impressive? INTERVIEWED: He did not come to my inauguration. He did not come to my State of the Union speeches, and that is okay. That is his right. And again, nobody has done more- INTERVIEWER: Right, but back- INTERVIEWED: for [NORP] than I have. INTERVIEWER: I understand. INTERVIEWED: He should've come. I think he made a big mistake by not showing up. INTERVIEWER: But taking your relationship with him out of it, do you find his story impressive? What he is done for this country? INTERVIEWED: He was a person that devoted a lot of energy and a lot of heart to civil rights, but there were many others also. INTERVIEWER: There is a petition to rename [FAC] in [GPE], [GPE] as [FAC]. Would you support that idea? INTERVIEWED: I would have no objection to it if they have like to do it. INTERVIEWER: Yeah? It is a good idea? INTERVIEWED: Would have no objection to it whatsoever. INTERVIEWER: Mr. [PERSON], you have been so generous with your time and we really appreciate. INTERVIEWED: Well, thank you very much. Great honor. INTERVIEWER: Thank you so much. INTERVIEWED: Thank you. Speaker [CARDINAL]: Okay, thank you. INTERVIEWED: Thank you very much. INTERVIEWER: Thank you, sir.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsjoebideninterviewtranscriptaugust6talksmentalfitnesshealthcare", "text": "Because there is of course a question on everybody's mind, I am sure you know what it is. Have you selected your vice president and who is she? Well, since this is embargoed to [DATE], I am not going to tell you. Do you know who she is yet? I mean, there are [CARDINAL] names circulating. There has been some criticism within your party that the process has been messy. It is been drawn out. How many women are on the shortlist exactly? Well, first of all, if they think it is been drawn out, they have not watched any other vice presidential picks in history. This is in fact ahead of time, as a matter of fact. Notice most vice presidential nominees are not announced until [DATE], [CARDINAL] or three before the convention. I have gone through it. It is been very orderly. Every one of the women we have interviewed is qualified. I have narrowed it down, and I will be ready to make that ann- How many? To how many, sir? You will find out shortly. You will find out shortly. Just want to follow up to you on that point, Mr. President. Sure. [INTERVIEWED], you have been through this experience before, the vetting process, the speculation, but someone on your own VP selection committee, former Senator [PERSON], reportedly has been critic critical of some in contention like Senator [PERSON] for not being more conciliatory since she went toe to toe with you during the debates. He says that is a reason she should be disqualified. Is that fair? No. Well, he did not say that to the press. He was talking to somebody offline and it was repeated. Now I do not hold grudges. I have made it really clear that I do not hold grudges. I think it was a debate. It is as simple as that, and she is very much contention. Now on [DATE] of your presidency, if we listen to the scientists and the doctors, as you say you will do, you are likely to begin your presidency in the middle of this ongoing pandemic. How likely is a rollback on [DATE] of the re-openings of businesses that we have seen nationwide? That is a good question, but an unfair question, because I have no idea what this president's going to leave me with. If he acts responsibly, which he has not done thus far, if he acts responsibly I may be in a position where we do not have to roll back. But if he continues to walk away, wave the white flag and just say open and then listen to some quacks telling him that what we should be doing and you can mass cause COVID-19, the whole thing is he is got to be more responsible. It depends on what I inherit to determine what I will be able to do and say and should be saying on [DATE] I sworn in, if that in fact happens. Based on what you see now, would you roll back the re-openings? I am not going to speculate on that, because I do not know what it is going to be. Based on what you see now? If you were president [DATE]. Oh, I am sorry, if I were president [DATE], I would roll back the re-openings in a number of places because, look, it is clear mask and social distancing make a gigantic difference in terms of the spread of this disease. It is simple, it is factual, it is real. Everyone, wherever there is a significant percentage of people with COVID should be required to keep social distancing and masks. Bars should not be open. There should not be congregations of [CARDINAL] people. We should have circumstances where, in fact, we act responsibly, including in places of work where people are, where they are able to go in and continue to work in terms of social distancing testing and alike. He is done none of that. None of that is part of what he is suggesting. I have laid out in detail what I would do and all the way back in [DATE], when this first came out. Then I did again in [DATE], talked about how I would invoke the Defense Act to require significant stockpiling of PPE. I would also have made sure that we would not have fired the overseers of the folks who determined the allocation of the money that the [ORG] has allocated so that the inspector generals know where the money's going. I have laid out in detail what I thought he should be doing with regard to the [ORG] and the standards that are required for businesses to open. I have laid it all out, and he is followed none of it. [INTERVIEWED], Yes? How often are you being briefed on the pandemic and who is in charge of keeping you up to date on what is going on? [CARDINAL] times a week, [TIME] a day. I just went through an [CARDINAL] page memo with my team, including [PERSON], who you know, and other docs, former heads of the [ORG] that are part of an entire team that I have, that we put together and go through it [CARDINAL] times a week. I spent [TIME]half [DATE] on the telephone. I mean, excuse me, on what we are doing right now, on camera. Based on what you have heard, a lot of people are concerned about schools, do you think children should be in schools in person while we are waiting on a vaccine to be developed? The answer is it depends. Look, I want our schools to open. The question is, will the president do the work he needs to make them safe? Just ordering your schools to open, like [PERSON] has done, is not it going to be good enough. I have laid out a roadmap to reopen schools safely and effectively. First, get the cases down in the communities through social distancing, masking, testing, tracing, and PPE. Second, give school districts uniform guidance without political interference on effectively and safely, the safety protocols, including ventilation, physical changes in classrooms. Third, give those districts the resources to implement the guidance. Studies show that we need [MONEY] to make school safe nationwide. For schools that cannot reopen safely, help them improve the virtual learning. Start working now to close the learning gap in terms of distance learning because of COVID. President [PERSON] should stop tweeting and start doing his work. What is key to people feeling safe to go back to work and school is a vaccine. A recent [ORG], [ORG] poll found that [PERCENT] of [NORP] would either wait to get a vaccine and see what happens to other people or not get one at all. That is a huge segment of the population. How then would you secure that every [NORP] gets a vaccine as soon as possible considering that distrust? Tell the truth. Listen to the science. Lay out explicitly whatever vaccine comes first. Make it totally open for review by every medical facility in the country, making clear that in fact it is safe, instead of what [PERSON] is talking about. He is talking about all these different vaccines. They are going to be ready to go, and so on and so forth. Much earlier I laid out what would we constitute a business being able to reopen. When I talked about it, I said we should have a circumstance where they were able to meet all the criteria that are recommended by the [ORG] and others and be able to put on a sticker on their window saying, like a good housekeeping seal, You can come in here because we test, we distance, we do all alike. The fact is that the way he talks about the vaccine is not particularly rational. He is talking it being ready. He is going to talk about moving it quicker than the scientists think it should be moved. It matters to let the people know that it is all transparent, exactly what the facts are. Let the medical community writ large speak to it so that there is transparency. Look, I think people are going to, as the poll show and we talked about it [DATE] with the [CARDINAL] docs and my staff, that in fact people do not believe that he is telling the truth. Therefore, they are not at all certain they are going to take the vaccine. [CARDINAL] more thing, if and when the vaccine comes, and it is not likely to go through all the tests that needs and the trials that are needed to be done, and the question is, is he going to seek emergency move? Well, I think it is really important right now. I proposed a [MONEY] plan for the distribution to guarantee that every single [NORP] has access to the vaccine because what is going to happen, you know as well as I do, if the vaccine came out [DATE], how in the heck would we get it to people? There is no game plan they have. How would everybody in [GPE] have access to it? It is a gigantic, gigantic problem to distribute, even if we have it. That is we should be planning for now. Now. Not when we get it. [INTERVIEWED], I'd like to ask you about healthcare because obviously this pandemic has exposed many weaknesses in healthcare. In your platform, you'd extend medical benefits to [ORG] recipients. But what about the workers who have no protection, specifically farm workers now deemed essential to make [NORP] sure that they have food on their table? Should undocumented immigrants also be able to get subsidized healthcare? If they are working in [GPE] and they are paying taxes, they should have access to healthcare. They should have access to what everybody else has access to. The most important thing to do- This is every undocumented worker? No, it depends. Not all undocumented workers are working. You say on every undocumented worker. Every person in the country, whether they are undocumented or documented, should have access to a vaccine if and when it occurs, should have access to testing and treatment and hospitalization, if it relates to the virus. That should occur, period. It is in the interest of everyone that everyone be taken care of, and everyone should be able to be eligible for that. Just to clarify, you are saying that if you are undocumented, you would be able to get a vaccine for free, subsidized? Yes. Yes. I'd also like to ask you this, this pandemic has exposed, as I have mentioned, so many weaknesses in the healthcare system. The most vulnerable, often black and brown communities, have been handling much of the financial burden. Before the pandemic, you were against comprehensive single-payer system. Now, if [ORG] came across your desk, as the pandemic has hit so hard, would you veto it? It is not going to come across my desk. But, look, the pandemic has not only torn through our nation, devastating families and wrecking economies, it is exacerbated some of the worst inequities. I am going to fight for health equities, but the quickest way to get that is for black and [NORP] [NORP] to have access to the [ORG] with a public option. That is the quickest way we can get everybody covered. But has not this pandemic and the tsunami of layoffs shown the limits of private health care that is tied to employment? No, it has not , in my view. There is countries that have, in fact, single-payer systems that had not helped them very much either. The question is, what do we do about corralling the pandemic and treating those who are affected by it? Everyone who is affected by the pandemic has access to free care for anything having to do with that pandemic. Now, some of your most ambitious legislative goals, [INTERVIEWED], are likely to face fierce [NORP] resistance. In fact, President [PERSON] during his eulogy for civil rights icon [PERSON] said the way to fully restore the Voting Rights Act is to abolish the [ORG] filibuster. Do you agree? I do not think we have to. We are going to be able to do that anyway. Look, we are going to elect- I do not think we have to, we are going to be able to do that anyway. Look where we are going to elect [CARDINAL] democratic senators. The [NORP] are going to control- That still will not get you enough of a super majority- No, no. To veto. That is your judgment. That is your judgment. I am pretty good at this. I have done that pretty well my whole career in [ORG] [ORG]. I got a lot done and here is the deal. The deal is that with President [PERSON] gone and the fear of retribution and his, how can I say it? His ego of following and ruining any [NORP] who disagrees with him, that is gone. That is gone, number [CARDINAL]. Number [CARDINAL], you are going to see a lot of [NORP], [CARDINAL] of them, beginning to vote their conscience because they no longer have the fear of [PERSON] being there. And thirdly, when we gain control of [ORG] [ORG], which I believe we will on the [ORG], you are going to find people willing to take a vote that was controversial before, because this time it will pass. There is no sense in making the reason why The way human nature works and you all work the same way, if you are going to have to go against the grain of the folks you hang out with in order to vote for something that is not going to pass anyway, you are not going to take the shot. But if you are hanging out with a group of people as against the grain, but you know it is going to pass with your vote, then that is a very different thing. I just do not believe that you are going to have this kind of resistance before, that we had before. And by the way, everybody said, we did not get anything done. After President was elected, after [PERSON] was elected, before he was sworn in, I put together a coalition to [NORP] and [NORP] to provide for [MONEY] to [ORG] and [MONEY] for cancer research. We only had something like a [CARDINAL] votes for it in the house and we only had something like [CARDINAL] in the [ORG]. It passed in [DATE]. It passed in [DATE], before he was sworn in. [CARDINAL] votes in the [ORG], [CARDINAL] votes in the [ORG]. Everybody's telling me we cannot get things done. We will get it done. Just to be clear, you do not agree with president [PERSON] that getting rid of the filibuster is necessary. He described it as a relic of [ORG]. What I said was that if in fact they are as obstreperous as is expected, we'd have to get rid of the filibuster, but the filibuster has also saved a lot of bad things from happening too. Yeah, no, no, I am sorry. I thought I am on record as saying that if the [NORP], if there is no way to move, other than getting rid of the filibuster, that is what we will do. I will jump in [INTERVIEWED] and ask, as we are talking about elections, the pandemic, as you know, is keeping a lot of people at home and there is a lot of interest in voting by mail, but there has been a lot of comments from President [PERSON] and other [NORP] casting doubt on the security of the election system. What should states be doing now to ensure voter confidence in the election? What many of them are doing, voter suppression is what he is trying to make a big deal out of it. There is nothing we are more focused on because frankly, this is the thing that keeps me up most nights, making sure everyone who wants to vote gets to vote, making sure that everyone's vote is counted. And we are going to undertake a historic effort in terms of resources, commitment, to beat back every voter suppression effort and to make sure that the voters know that every legal option available. Our campaign has a strong, effective voter protection and anti voter suppression program. Voter protection campaigns we are putting together for [DATE], meet the unique requirements and challenges that we are facing from this president. No campaign has ever built anything to the scale that we have built to make sure we can get out the vote. We have a major, major dedicated operation in states to address the head on voter suppression and any form of that is going to take and steps we can take to go to court as well. But look, think about this. Did you ever think you'd live in a country where you had a President of [GPE] saying, Let us postpone an election. People see through this. You have [CARDINAL] mail in state voting places, [CARDINAL] of them overwhelming [NORP]. [NORP] support mail in voting. [NORP]. We saw with COVID has done to elections during the primaries. And we know there are voter suppression problems that have nothing to do with COVID. We are going to be prepared to make sure people have an opportunity to be protected when they show up in person to vote and we are going to have to work with election officials in key cities and battleground states to increase the number of early voting locations and in [CARDINAL] recent case, almost double the number of people showed up to vote. In [GPE] where the law permits, we are going to be providing voters, absentee ballot request forms, pre paid postage, and the like. We are trying to raise money to be able to do that. The [ORG] when they passed the Cares Act, they provided [MONEY] for a voter to help states improve their voting systems. What is the president doing? He is talking about defunding the post office for God's sake. What more do you need? Yes? I am sitting in [GPE], [GPE], and it is been [DATE] since a gunman walked into a [ORG] and killed [CARDINAL] people. He told police, he came to kill [NORP]. This is the largest attack on [NORP] in modern history. You have accused President [PERSON] of bearing responsibility for the rise in hate crimes. How do you convince white supremacists that minority groups are vital to restore in the soul of [GPE]? I do not convince white supremacists. They are not going to be convinced. They have to be put in jail when they do things that are inappropriate. White supremacists are not going to be convinced, but the vast, vast, vast majority of people are not white supremacists. Look, here is the deal. I have been involved in civil rights my whole life and one of the things I thought was that I thought we could really defeat hate. I thought there is a way to defeat it. And when I got out of law school, I came back, my city was in flames. My city was the only city, [GPE], [GPE], occupied by [ORG] for [DATE] since the Civil War, it just had not happened since then. And so what happened? What happened was, I came back, had a good job, decided to leave it, become a public defender. And I used to interview my clients down by the railroad station and here I was [DATE] later to the month, standing under that same railroad station, waiting for a black man to come and pick me up to take me to [GPE], be sworn in as President and Vice President of [GPE]. So I called my [CARDINAL] children up. My son was the Attorney General of the state of [GPE]. My other son was the head of the world food program [GPE]. And my daughter's a social worker dealing with criminal justice. And so I said, Do not tell me things cannot change, look. I looked over the East side and I said, That was all barren and burned to the ground. Now it is moving and so on. And so I thought you could defeat hate. The reason I am running is because of [PERSON], what he said when those folks came out of the fields in [GPE]. I realized hate does not go away, it just hides. And when a president breaths oxygen under the rocks, he pulls them out. He legitimizes them. They make up a significant minority of the [NORP] public, but left unattended, they grow, they grow and they cause great damage. And that is why we have to make sure we do a whole range of things. There is a lot of things we are going to do because look, for the first time, you have over 70% of the [NORP] people concluding that black lives matter. The phrase Black Lives Matter. You have almost as many whites marching with blacks to say, Let us end this systemic racism in [GPE]. I think the country's ready. They are ready because they know we can make significant progress and they know the reason why they have been saved from COVID is because of the [NORP] and black communities have been doing all the hard work. You got [CARDINAL] of [ORG] students out there doing the mainline work and making sure that people are safe. You have all kinds of folks, the woman making sure she is stacking the grocery shelf to make sure we have food to eat. The farm worker, you talked about ma'am, but was making sure we have the food to get in the table. They have figured it out. And we have a confluence of [CARDINAL] things that have happened, that are going to give us an enormous opportunity to change the dynamic in [GPE]. [CARDINAL], the COVID pandemic, [CARDINAL], the gigantic unemployment, [CARDINAL], the systemic racism that is so, so, so exposed. We can now move in a direction. That is why I put this Build Back Better plan together, focusing the last, the last piece on racial equity. We can do this. The country's ready. They know we must. I am confident. [INTERVIEWED], I want to follow up on your point to [PERSON]'s question that white supremacists cannot be convinced. You just said there that the extreme right wing folks in the country left unattended, will grow. Should not there be some sentiment to reach out to people who hold racist views to convince them otherwise? No, that is different. That is different than the white Look, you are talking about white supremacists. I thought you were talking about the people like the kid who showed up in [GPE] and gunned down all those innocent people. Okay? That is what we are talking about. [ORG] and the like, the white supremacists, those who belong to those groups, they are a minority. I am reaching out to everyone else. I have done it my whole career. My state is the eighth largest black population in [GPE] as a percent of population. That is where I started. That is my support. That is what I have been working with my whole career. And you can deal with those who, in fact, are prejudice. A lot of prejudice out there, but not everyone's a white supremacist, like the kid who went in and gunned down those folks in [GPE]. There is a difference. Now, you have apologized for your role in the [DATE] Crime Bill that created the Three Strikes Law, expanded the list of crimes punishable by death. What will you do now to make up for what you have described as the pain brought by that bill, that many people still feel [DATE]? Well, let us get something straight. The bill at the time it was passed, was overwhelmingly passed with every major black mayor in [GPE]. The black caucus supported it and violent crime against [NORP], fell by [PERCENT]. It had things in it that I did not like at all, like [CARDINAL] strikes and you are out, which I argued against. It also had some very good things in it; assault weapons ban, drug courts, it made sure that we were in a position where we were going to focus on dealing with rehabilitation. [CARDINAL] of it went to prevention, [CARDINAL] to rehabilitation, all of those things they in fact made sense. On balanced the whole bill, there were [CARDINAL] provisions that were really bad. [CARDINAL] was [CARDINAL] strikes and you are out and [CARDINAL] was a mandatory And only employed twice. And [CARDINAL], the idea that carjacking was a mandatory minimum penalty, if you were convicted of it and [CARDINAL], money for state prisons, [CARDINAL] of which I opposed. But on balance, it was a much, much, much better bill. And so now we face a different problem. We have too many people in prison. That is why President [PERSON] and I reduced the federal population by [CARDINAL] 000. Of all the people in prison [DATE], [PERCENT] are behind a bar in a state prison, a county jail and or a city jail. As we passed the Fair Sentencing Act, to reduce sentences related to crack cocaine. I am running on a plan to reform the criminal justice system so we can fix it. It should be a rehabilitation system. No one should go to jail for a drug offense, for example, which I have argued for a long time. They should go to mandatory treatment. We automatically wipe out anyone's record for using marijuana. Once people get out of the system, all their rights should be restored, including the Pell Grants and voting rights and access to housing. We also have to expand the power of the justice department to adjust systemic misconduct by police departments and prosecutors and establish an independent taskforce on prosecutorial discretion. That is what I have been pushing. And I have been pushing in for now a long time. We are going to get that passed. The city of [GPE], [GPE] recently approved what they call reparations to their [NORP] community in the form of home ownership, affordable housing and access to capital for businesses. My question for you is, do you think the [NORP] government owes black people reparations and what form, if so, should it take? I think the studies suggested by my friend, [PERSON], should be followed through and seen. In the meantime, we cannot wait. If you take a look at my Build Back Better plan, which you probably have not had a Meantime, we cannot wait. If you take a look at my [ORG] plan, which you probably have not had a chance to read, it does all the things that [GPE] just did. It provides for a down payment, first time down payment of [MONEY] 000 for black [NORP] and [NORP] seeking housing and invest significantly more money in public housing, we used to call it public housing, subsidized rental. Nobody should be paying [PERCENT] of their income for rent. It fundamentally alters access to capital across the board for small businesses. They are the vast majority. We have already [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] black, small business gone out of business. That should not be happening. They should be at the front of the line. I propose that we take the program [PERSON] and I put together that said that there is [CARDINAL], 005 that brought [MONEY] off the sidelines for entrepreneurs, black entrepreneurs and [inaudible [DATE]] has chased that to- If I may, you rolled out a plan [DATE] for [NORP]. My first question is what took you so long to come up with a plan for the largest minority group in the country? And this plan talks a lot about the urgent actions. What is at the top of that list. Well, first of all, everything in that plan, I have already said over [DATE], we just packaged it together. So everybody knew what it was. And so is a one place. Number [CARDINAL], the most urgent thing is to fix the First of all, every executive order this president has issued relating to the border and relating to dealing with the [NORP] community is going to be pulled back. We are not going to be fooling with that here. First thing I am going to do and I have already written, sent to [GPE] [ORG] a path to citizenship for [CARDINAL] undocumented folks. [ORG] is going to be preserved period. Period. And you are going to be put on a path to citizenship. We are going to invest in economic mobility, invest in wealth inside [NORP] communities especially [NORP] businesses, and ensuring [NORP] have access to credit and capital by providing [NORP] businesses access to participate in federal contracts and critical assistance programs, ensuring economic relief reaches [NORP] businesses. That is what my whole plan about manufacturing [GPE] and dealing with all the public money being spent under the control of the president. That is one that will in fact be available, those contracts and that chain, that supply chain for manufacturing is owned by many small business people, [NORP], as well as [NORP] and other minorities. We are going to expand that. I am going to finish this answer. And the last piece is we are going to tackle the inequities in education. That is why I am tripling the money for title [CARDINAL] schools, providing university and pre-kindergarten all across the board. We are going to make sure that the funding gap is existed. We are going to expand STEM curricula. We are going to deal with underserved schools, and we are going to make sure that anyone who comes from a family making [MONEY], 000 has free access to [DATE] of public education college. There is a lot more. So anyway. Thank you. Thank you for that. I have a few questions that I'd just like to get through because they are incredibly important to the [NORP] community. First of all, you are extending TPS, temporary protected status, to [NORP]. [NORP] though, are now being deported in unprecedented numbers. Would you stop those deportations? What I said, I am going to look at every single country in the world that in fact is being and this guy's sending them back. The reason why I came up with [GPE] is he not even allowing it to exist in the first place. And so the TPS program is something I will move on [DATE] I am in office to make sure that we extend it to people. For too long we did not get it right, but here is the deal. I think that we should be extending it. Anybody can prove that they are in jeopardy to go back to their country and the reason they came in the first place. They should be able to stay in [GPE] until the circumstance changes in our country. And that is why, by the way, I put that program together to provide Oh, go ahead. I am sorry. No. No. Are you going to reengage with [GPE] though? I mean, I am specifically wondering about the [GPE] communities that are incredibly interested in the [GPE] issue and see status given to [NORP] while [NORP] are being deported. So will you engage with [GPE]? The answer is yes. Yes. Yes. And by the way, what you all know, but most people do not know, unlike the [NORP] community with notable exceptions, the [NORP] community is an incredibly diverse community, with incredibly different attitudes about different things. You go to [GPE], you find a very different attitude about immigration in certain places than you do when you are in [GPE]. So it is a very different, a very diverse community. So president [PERSON] was known as the deporter in chief from moving [CARDINAL] people during the [PERSON] [PERSON] administration. [PERSON] campaigned to build that wall. I did. No. The [PERSON] [PERSON] administration. [PERSON] campaigned on build that wall. Are you willing to tear that wall down? No, there will not be [QUANTITY] of wall constructed on my administration number one. Number two, what I am going to focus on and the fact is that somebody in this group written a lot about the border. I am going to make sure that we have border protection, but it is going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it and at the ports of entry. That is where all bad stuff is happening. What about the land confiscations? End. End. Stop. Done. Over. Not going to do it. Withdraw the lawsuits. We are out. We are not going to confiscate the land. [INTERVIEWED], under the [PERSON] administration, asylum has virtually ended. [ORG] detention centers are empty. Your new plan calls for reversing President [PERSON]'s harsh plan, but will not that restart a brand new border crisis? I mean, what would you do with all those people in camps now waiting in [GPE]? It will if we do not do it well, we do not reach out to the charitable communities that will come in and help, and in addition to us spending [MONEY] providing for access, access for judges, access for asylum folks to be on the border to move quickly. Because if we just say, Okay, all done. I have withdrawn the order. You are going to have a crisis on the other side of the border as well. And we should not be putting these people when they come across the border in jail. We should be doing monitoring. There is ways to monitor without putting them in jail. Number one, but we have to make sure that we build up the infrastructure to be able to accommodate [PERSON]'s cruel, inhumane border policies, ripping children from their mother's arms and [PERSON]'s migrant protection protocols, remain in [GPE] program. I mean, all of this is going to take time, not a long time, but you have to be prepared so we do not create another crisis as you pointed out. Sorry. What are you trying [inaudible [TIME]] [ORG]? How do you hold it accountable? You hold it accountable by being president and acting accountable. I will have someone heading that department that listens to what we say. It is outrageous what is being done now. And by the way, [ORG] is going to go back to school. The idea that [ORG] is sitting outside of a mass on [DATE] to arrest a parent coming out as undocumented, the idea that they are going to schools, the idea they are going to doctor's appointments is wrong. This is about families. Families. And you have so many young children, so many young children under enormous pressure and psychological pressure, wondering whether or not they are going to come home there is going to be no one there. We need to do so much more. There is a way. From my perspective, it is all about families. We have to push humanitarian resources to make sure that we have public private partnerships to support people living in these conditions. We have got to surge resources for the asylum protectors. There is so much we can do, but guess what- Are those asylum seekers? It is going to cost a lot of money and I have been calling for it for [DATE]. Are those asylum seekers that are on the other side of the border now in camps going to be allowed to come and do their claims inside [GPE], something that has not been reported to them? There is got to be an orderly process for that to occur as your colleague said. Otherwise, if I just say, [DATE], everybody comes across the border. This is the first time ever. You have had to seek asylum in a third country. It is outrageous. It is outrageous. It is wrong. [INTERVIEWED], your opponent in this election, President [PERSON], has made your mental state a campaign topic. And when asked in [DATE], if you'd been tested full cognitive decline, you have responded that you are constantly tested in effect because you are in situations like this on the campaign trail. But please clarify specifically, have you taken a cognitive test? No, I have not taken a test. Why the hell would I take a test? Come on man. That is like saying, Before you got in this program, if you take a test where you are taking cocaine or not. What do you think? Huh? Are you a junky? What do you say to President [PERSON] who brags about his test and makes you a message say an issue for voters? Well, if he cannot figure out the difference between an elephant and a lion, I do not know what the hell he is talking about. Did you watch that? Look, come on, man. I know you are trying to goad me, but I mean, I am so forward-looking to have an opportunity to sit with the President or stand with the President in debates. There going to be plenty of time. And by the way, as I joke with him I should not say it. I am going to say something I probably should not say. Anyway, I am very willing to let the [NORP] public judge my physical as well as my mental fitness and to make a judgment about who I am and what state of affairs I have, what kind of physical shape I am in, what kind of mental shape I am in. Someone who is on your VP shortlist, Senator [PERSON], told [ORG] [DATE] that [ORG] would have no choice, but to prosecute [PERSON] after his presidency. Should you win, would you follow through on the many investigations? Could you envision him, a former president, being prosecuted if the evidence shows wrongdoing? Look, [ORG] is not the President's law firm. The attorney general is not the President's private lawyer. I will not interfere with [ORG] judgment of whether or not they think they should pursue the prosecution of anyone that they think has violated the law- Including a former president? It depends on what happens. It depends on what happens. I think it is a very, very unusual thing and probably not very How can I say it? Good for democracy to be talking about prosecuting former presidents. Well, what has to happen? You say, depending on what happens. What has to happen? What is the bar to you to have to- I do not know what some of these cases going on in the [GPE] courts are. I do not know the detail of those cases. And so if there is a case underway that in fact has to be pursued and I believe it should be pursued and the attorney general thinks it is, that is a very different thing. But in terms of saying, I think the President violated the law. I think the President did this, therefore go and prosecute him. I will not do that. But if it shows that there was wrongdoing, you believe that a president could actually be prosecuted? I do not think anyone's above the law. And I love the way you are trying to get me into this thing about lock them up. I am not going there. Well, there are right now a number of investigations. I mean, [GPE] of [GPE] just said that their extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the [PERSON] organization that they are looking into. This is not speculative. This is something that is actually happening. I said, those things that are underway, if they prove to be a criminal offense, then in fact that would be up to the attorney general to decide whether he or she want to proceed with it. I am not going to make that individual judgment. He is not my lawyer or she is not my lawyer. [INTERVIEWED], I want to go back to voting rights. You talked a lot earlier about that you think there are some states that are engaging in voter suppression and my question- some [NORP] that are engaging in voter suppression. And my question is if you were to become President, is there anything you have considered taking executive action in order to shore up voting systems or protect voting rights for [NORP] public without waiting for congressional approval or a bill to pass? Well, the answer is I'd do what [PERSON] and I did in our administration, the Attorney General would go after, there are somewhere [CARDINAL] attempts that have been made and I think it is [CARDINAL] States, do not hold me to the exact number, to suppress voting, to make it harder to vote. And I would take those systems, and those I'd challenge in court, those attempts, those new attempts at [PERSON]. I would do that. I would have the Attorney General go out and make sure that we have, and the first thing I am going to do in terms of [ORG], I was the guy who got the Voting Rights Act extended for [DATE]. And along came the [PERSON] case and [GPE] in [GPE] and the court came along and said, There is no longer a requirement that you have get pre-clearance because of the conduct in the past. So any change you wish to make an electoral process, you have to check through the courts. They said that is old, but they cannot do that. We are allowed to change. There is no constitutional prohibition to change the provision in the law, I think it is section [CARDINAL], I am not positive, to change that provision to say they require pre-clearance under certain conditions, that requires a vote in [ORG] [ORG] that is now called, that is now the [PERSON] amendment to the Voting Rights Act. And that is what I pushed very hard and I have been pushing it for a long time. We just want to get in just [CARDINAL] question in the international sphere, President [PERSON] is not the first President to say [GPE] is ripping off [GPE]. President [PERSON] made similar complaints. Some have said [PERSON]'s stance is a good one to counter [GPE]'s influence. Would you keep the tariffs? No. Hey look, who said [PERSON]'s idea is a good one? Who said [PERSON]'s idea is a good one? Some feel that- Some. [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] people. Manufacturing has gone on recession. Agriculture lost [MONEY] that taxpayers had to pay. We are going after [GPE] in the wrong way. [GPE] is stealing intellectual property. [GPE]'s conditioning being able to do business in [GPE] based on whether or not you have [PERCENT] [NORP] ownership. That is got to end. I spent a fair amount of time when I was Vice President with President [PERSON], because the President wanted me to get to know him. He is no [NORP] with a small D at all, but here is the deal, he made it real clear, he- So he scrapped those tariffs, what do you want in return? Or you are just going to scrap them without any concessions? No, no, here is the deal. The question is what is the appropriate behavior that they have to engage in international trade with us and they have to play by the international rules. And what we have done is we have disarmed ourselves. We make up [PERCENT] of the world's economy, but we poked our finger in the eye of all of our allies out there. The way [GPE] will respond is when we gather the rest of the world that in fact invasion and open trade and making sure that we are in a position that we deal with WHO the right way, in fact, that is when things began to change. That is when [GPE]'s behavior is going to change. For example, when I was last there, he said to me, [PERSON], that they set up an error identification zone that they had an international airspace that said that you had to check with [GPE] before you could fly through it. I said, We are not going to pay attention. He said, What do you want me to do? Take it down. I said, You should, but we are not going to pay attention. So we flew B-1 bomber through it. We have got to make it clear, the international rules of the road in terms of airspace, sea space, and the way in which you deal with the trade and equity that have to be imposed. And what we did in our administration, when they started dumping steel, we responded. They just overproduced and they just started dumping steel through the state owned entities. We responded and it stopped. They also did the same thing with tires. And so you respond under the rules, the international rules of trade and hold them to it. That is what you do. And just as we run out of time here, Mr. Vice-President, how would you confront [GPE] on the alleged human rights abuses, not just toward [GPE], but toward [NORP] Muslims, as well, beyond these newly announced [ORG] sanctions? You may recall, I was the first one to say, we should act and go to [ORG] with the [NORP]. I believe the first one, period. We should be in [ORG] condemning [GPE]'s action. They are concentration camps, they are concentration camps. And look what happened when he did not respond to what was going on in [GPE], it emboldened [GPE] does just to go ahead and break what had been an agreement they had made about the quasi independence of [GPE]. Now it is done. And so now we are taking action relative to [GPE], but look, folks, you have to speak up. He is walked away. He has no conception of human rights. The way he is embraced dictators and thugs around the world. The way he is failed to take on [PERSON] in terms of what is going on in [GPE], what is going on in [GPE], what is going on in Eastern Europe. What is going on. Look, this is a man who is embraced all the wrong people, all the wrong people. And he treats [ORG] like it is a protection racket. So I just think that this is we get to say, [GPE], these are the international rules of the road. You play by them, or we are not playing. Period. Now what we most have to do, excuse me. What is most is we have invest in our own people. We used to invest nationally [PERCENT] of our GDP in technology as a government. It is now down to [CARDINAL], if I am not mistaken, could be [PERCENT]. What are we doing? What in God's name are we doing? They are going to own the 5G market, they are making sure they are focusing extensively on IT. And we are doing what? What are we doing? [PERSON] continues to focus on all those industries that are obsolete in [GPE]. We should be investing in made in [GPE] and make sure that our workers can out compete anybody in the world, anybody in the world, but what are we doing? They are not being trained. We are not focused on it. I am sorry. I am sorry. Sir you had a question. I know we have to go and I have another event, but fire away. I wanted to thank you for your time, [INTERVIEWED]. And wondering if you have any closing remarks for the membership of [ORG], [ORG], people who are watching this interview right now? Well, first of all, I just want to thank especially want to thank President [PERSON] and [PERSON], as he referred to the President for the leadership and inviting me to join you [DATE]. Look, I want to thank you for all the work you do by strengthening diversity in our press, strengthening quality and capacity of the press and is broadening our perspective and deepening our connection with each other. We need that more now than ever. We need people who know about it, especially at a time when black and [NORP] reporters have been targeted by this President for asking questions, honest questions, and condemn for standing strong and for doing their job. Look, [GPE]'s facing a confluence of crisis and immeasurable pain, but we are also facing an incredible opportunity. It is an opportunity to right a wrong that has festered since our founding fathers. The fact is black and [NORP] [NORP] have never been fully included in our democracy or our economy. And it is a moral failure. It seeps into everything. I have said it already, in the course of this pandemic, black and [NORP] [NORP] have been [CARDINAL] times as likely to get infected and twice as likely to die. Black and [NORP] [NORP] are disproportionately out of work, facing evictions, losing hope. The communities are the first ones to get hit and the last ones to get any relief. We need overwhelming response to right that wrong. I am proud of the sweeping plan I put together to build back better, including everyone in the deal. It is long past time we deal with systemic racism in [GPE] and deliver black and [NORP] [NORP] their full share of the [NORP] dream. Every one of us has a role to play in that work. So I want to thank you for shining a light on all of this and the work you do, and the stories you communicate because you have great credibility in the people you communicate to, it matters a great deal. And folks, I know you may not agree, but I honest to God think we have been delivered to one of those inflection points in [NORP] history that has not occurred since [DATE], where the public has had the blinders taken off and they have looked around and said, Oh my God, I did not realize it. I did not realize exactly what was going on here. And you began to see it happening. I am convinced, and I am also emboldened by the younger generation, the generation Z to the young millennials. They are the best educated, the least prejudiced, the most open generation in [NORP] history. I think we are ready. I will just say [CARDINAL] last thing. When you have [CARDINAL] out of every [CARDINAL] students in kindergarten through high school that speaks Spanish, how in God's name does it make any sense for any other [NORP] to say there is nothing we should do more than make sure they are fully integrated, educated, and grow? They are the future. It is the future of the country. It is real. It is not a joke. It is real. And the idea we walk away makes no sense. And by the way, I make these talks and speeches, when we are able to get out through [ORG] to [NORP], I say, Tell me how you do not benefit when [NORP] are better educated and have access to education, housing, and businesses? How are you not better off when [NORP] small business men and women profligate throughout the country? How are you not better off when they are better educated? People are beginning to figure it out, beginning to figure it out. And so I think we have been delivered this terrible time in our history, but it is given us a great, great opportunity. I really honest to God believe the combination of COVID, the economic collapse, the situation we have with regard to racism in this country, and it is been exposed by [PERSON] and others what happened, and everybody now realizing science matters, and they are beginning to focus on environment. We can provide [CARDINAL] of good paying jobs, grow the economy, even though I am supposedly the liberal progressive guy, you got Wall Street people saying, Hey, man, this can grow the economy. We can generate economic growth. And once again, lead the world but we have to stop, we have always led the world, as I said, not by the example of our power, but the power of our example. And it is messy, we are being devastated all around the world. We can change that. I know how to do that. That is what I have done my whole life. Thank you for taking the time and listening. Well, [INTERVIEWED], we appreciate you having this conversation on behalf of voters. So on behalf of myself, [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], and everyone gathered here [DATE], thank you very much for your time. I hope you will have me back for real. I am happy to, okay? Open invite. You got it.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsdonaldtrumpfoxandfriendsinterviewtranscriptdecember2021", "text": "All right. Let us bring the former president of [GPE]. Number [CARDINAL]. Will he be number [CARDINAL]? But first things first, congratulations on your brand new book, [INTERVIEWED1]. Well, thank you very much, [INTERVIEWER3]. Thank you. [TIME]. What went into it? What was your approach here? Just to bring back [DATE] to life through photographs? Well, we had [DATE] and I have been watching what is happening and a lot of people, they were remorseful and they were like, Can we do something? And it is really pictures of a lot of great things with the military, with so many of the things we have done. And I think it is sort of a happy book. We bring in some negativity what is happening now, but frankly, it is really a happy book and it is a book largely of beautiful pictures, of events that took place, and some of the things we have done. Sure. And we are going to talk more about the book a little later on, by the way you pre order right now at 45books.com. [INTERVIEWED1], your administration came up [DATE]. Our [ORG] correspondent asked [PERSON] about something that [PERSON] said about you during the campaign and during [CARDINAL] of the debates and she turned it around. Anyway, it is a great question and listen to the answer as well. Here is [DATE] at [FAC]. In [DATE], when [CARDINAL] 000 [NORP] had already died of COVID, [PERSON] said about [INTERVIEWED1], Anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of [GPE]. Is that still the standard? Now that more [NORP] have died under President [PERSON] than [INTERVIEWED1]. And the former president was people inject bleach. He apparently reportedly did not even share with people, he was going to interact with, that he had tested positive for COVID himself. He continued to provide a forum for misinformation. This president has made the vaccine widely available. He is relied on the advice of his health and medical experts, and he is trying to be a part of solving crisis, getting the pandemic under control. And I think there is a pretty stark difference between their approaches. So [INTERVIEWED1], when [PERSON] said, during the debate with you, that [CARDINAL] 000 [NORP] had died on your watch, you should not be president [GPE]. Now more people have actually died- [CARDINAL]. During the [PERSON] administration. Well, he is done a terrible job, just like he did with the H1N1. He is done just an absolutely terrible job, getting it out and getting people to take it. People just do not want to take it. And the vaccines, I have to be very proud of the vaccines. We did it in [DATE]. People said it to take [DATE] and probably would not work. They work incredibly well. Some people do not want to take them and that is their freedom and that is what we have to do, but people do not want to take them because they do not trust [PERSON], they do not trust the administration. We had none of that. Everybody was fighting to take them and we were doing great. We were doing really great on distribution. We also bought [MONEY] worth before we knew it was going to be successful, which saved us [DATE]. So many things we did right, and what they are doing is very sad when you look at what is happening. But more people died during [DATE] than [DATE] by a very substantial margin, and sadly, [DATE] is not up. Well, [INTERVIEWED1], why would not people trust the vaccines? They were developed during your administration. Well, a couple of things. Number [CARDINAL], they did a pause on [ORG], which really sent shocks through, over [CARDINAL] people that did not die by the way, but [CARDINAL] people, and for that [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] of shots given, and they did the pause with [ORG], that was very bad. And they just have not been able to sell it. People are not trusting this administration. And if you remember when during the debate, I think she said, and he said, Oh, if it is [INTERVIEWED1], I will not take the vaccine. I will not take the vaccine. And then as soon as he got elected, he tried to claim that he did it, but he forgot that he got a shot during my administration, he got a shot. But there was just a great distrust of what they were saying and what they were doing, and I think that is the problem. And that is why they are trying to set up mandates and really hurting things with the economy, with the mandates, in addition to other things. Well, [PERSON] kept changing what we were supposed to be doing. And then when you look at [GPE], you talk to military families and they say, We do not trust this administration. We put our kids lives in the president's hand and look what he did. He pulled out and left so many [NORP] behind enemy lines. Many of them are still there. When you look at the border, people do not trust what he is doing down there, because you will hear Dr. [PERSON] saying, You need to wear your mask. You need to get vaccinated. But yet they are letting so many people flow over the [NORP] border and [INTERVIEWER1], he had [DATE] [DATE]. He was also at the press conference with Dr. [PERSON], and he pressed him on that issue. Listen to this, [INTERVIEWED1], Dr. [PERSON], as you advise the president about the possibility of new testing requirements for people coming into this country, does that include everybody? The answer is yes, and everybody who is coming into the country needs to get a test with in [TIME] of getting on the plane to come here. Well, what about people who do not take a plane and just these border crossers coming in in huge numbers? But that is a different issue. You do not have the capability, as you know of somebody getting on a plane, getting checked, looking at a passport, we do not have that there. Is there something to do to test these people somewhere else? No. There is testing at the border under certain circumstances, as you know. Yeah. But not by the federal government. [INTERVIEWED1], your reaction? It is a disaster. We have [CARDINAL] of people flowing across, and we are not only talking about the [GPE] virus or COVID, whatever you want to call it. We are talking about many other diseases coming over the border that are far worse, coming over the border. And nobody is being tested, nobody is being checked. Prisons of other countries are being dumped into our country. We are like a dumping ground. We had the strongest border in the history of our country. The wall was largely built, it could have been finished in [DATE] and they decided not to finish the openings, it is just some openings. We did an incredible job, [QUANTITY] of wall. And this is why that, coupled with other things gave us the greatest numbers we have ever had, the most successful it is ever been. We take people in, but take them in legally. Now, [CARDINAL] other thing that is pouring in right now that nobody even mentioned are drugs. Drugs are coming in at a rate of [CARDINAL] times greater than when I was doing it, and our numbers were going way down. We were having the lowest drug numbers, and if you look at the numbers of people that are coming in now, we are [CARDINAL] of people [DATE], we are look at a [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], maybe even [CARDINAL] people a year, and none of those people are tested. So it seems to me that the Remain in [GPE] program that was widely ridiculed by the current president of [GPE], now according to the courts, has to be reimplemented and officially goes back into production, Remain in Mexico starts again. But- Your policy. Your policy is back in, I think starting [DATE]. What is your reaction to that? Well, they should have never ended it. If [PERSON] would've come in and just gone to the beach, he would've been successful in many ways, because all of this stuff, the border was the best that ever was and getting better, drugs coming in was getting at a level that we have never seen before, meaning- Is there a sense of gratification, [INTERVIEWED1]? [crosstalk [TIME] Is there a sense of gratification for you personally, that a policy that he ridiculed, the courts are making input back in? No, because I want to see good for the country, [INTERVIEWER3]. It is so important to me, I want to see good for the country. There is no gratification. What they are doing is destroying our country. Our country is being destroyed before your very eyes, and I have never seen anything like it. The withdrawal from [GPE], I got us there. We were down to [CARDINAL] troops, the [ORG] respected us. [PERSON], I dealt with him a lot, he respected us. We were going to take the people out. We were going to take some [NORP] out, we were going to take our equipment out. We left [MONEY] worth of equipment, it is unthinkable, and they had a parade [DATE] showing off all the equipment they took. It was like a surrender. There is never been a lower point in the history of our country. And do not think that [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] were not watching, because that was the greatest embarrassment in the history of our country, in my opinion. If you are just joining us- And almost everybody's opinion. If you are just joining us, we are speaking to [INTERVIEWED1], former president of [GPE], about news of [DATE]. We are going to talk about his new book that comes out in [DATE] in a moment. [INTERVIEWED1], we all know that there is a supply chain bottleneck and [PERSON] [DATE] essentially said, does not matter if you are naughty or nice [DATE], there are going to be problems, but he did say [CARDINAL] person and [CARDINAL] person can promise whether or not you are going to get your stuff. Listen to this. If you watch the news recently, you might think the shelves in all our stores are empty across the country. That parents will not be able to get presents for their children [DATE], but here is the deal: for the vast majority of the country, that is not what is happening. I have also spoken with the CEOs of [ORG] and [ORG], which are on track to deliver more packages than ever. Now, I cannot promise that every person will get every gift they want on time, only [PERSON] can keep that promise. Okay, so he makes a joke out of it at the end, but it is a real crisis. If you were present of [GPE], and clearly the administration did not plan adequately as the demand returned after COVID and the pandemic, and we are creeping back toward normal times. But [INTERVIEWED1], what would you do to fix the supply chain crisis? Well, first of all, it would've never happened. Nobody ever mentioned those words, supply chains, they were never brought up. We had perfect supply chains. We had the greatest economy in history. We then had the [GPE] virus, we fixed it, we did a great job with it. And between not only that, the ventilators, all of the different things that we did, stocking up all of the states, which by the way, all of the cupboards were bare, and that includes the [GPE] government. There was nothing there, we did a hell of a job. We have got no credit for it, but maybe someday we will. But we would've never had a supply chain problem, but one of the causes is the mandates because a lot of people are not working because of forced mandates. That is one of the very big causes. Another thing that is going to be a big problem, and it is a problem like nobody seen before, we were energy independent. We did not need ships all over the place, clogging up the waters coming in from [GPE], [GPE] and other places. We were the biggest in the world. We went to the biggest in the world. Within [DATE], we would've been bigger than [GPE] and [GPE] combined with real energy, and it is called liquid gold under our feet. We have an advantage that other countries like [GPE] do not have. So many different things, but the mandates had a lot to do with the supply chain problem. Something that is also frustrating for [NORP] is the amount of crime that has gone up in our country and the way that our men and women in blue are being treated. [ORG], they have had enough. They tweeted this out [DATE]. They said, Enough is enough. More officers have been shot and killed [DATE] than [DATE]. And there is [DATE] left, [CARDINAL] officers shot [CARDINAL] officers killed by gunfire, ambush attacks on officers up [PERCENT] from [DATE]. Pray for [GPE]'s law enforcement. [INTERVIEWED1], this does not include the [GPE] officer that was killed that we are all praying for, and another officer that was shot and is trying to recover right now. What is your reaction into that tweet? Well, when you look at [GPE] and you look at [CARDINAL] kids or people running into a store together, and the cops are standing out there, not allowed to do their job, they are not allowed to do their job. And you allow a thing like that to happen. We have a country has no law enforcement, has no law and order. Our police are great, they are not allowed to do their job. And they are now being hit. People are not even afraid. They go and shoot police, they do not respect them. The people of our country love our police and they do respect them, but they are not allowed to do their job. If you allowed them to do their job, that would stop and crime would stop, but they are not allowed. You look at what is going on in [GPE], you look at what is going on in [GPE] and look at what is happening in [GPE]. And it is happening in many other cities that they do not want to report about. The media outside of you people and a few others, the media is not reporting this problem. But where you have hoarded of people running in, kids mostly, running in and stealing, robbing stores where drug chains are closing all their stores in different cities because they cannot keep them open. We just do not have law enforcement. We are not allowed to have law enforcement. I will tell you what, our country is being destroyed. It should never be allowed to happen. The police have to be given their power back. They have to stop the crime. They can do it and they want to do it, but they are not allowed to do it. Ms. President, you referenced this a little bit earlier, and that is [GPE]. We know that they launched this virus unintentionally, perhaps, who knows. They will not tell us. This killed [CARDINAL] [NORP] and [CARDINAL] around the globe. We know they just disappeared their leading tennis player because she accused a former official of sexual assault. The [ORG] is pulling out all the tournaments there. There is a growing push to boycott the China Olympics, who by the way, also have rounded up their [NORP] into concentration camps and are torturing them as well as harvesting their organs, while doing the over fights in [GPE], threatening their neighbors. Is this the time to say we are not going to go to the [DATE] Olympics? And by the way, before I answer that, none of this happened with us. They did not send bombers over the middle of [GPE]. He knew not to do that. Had a very good relationship with President [PERSON]. He knew very well, you cannot send bombers over [GPE]. None of that stuff happened. And they will wait until after the Olympics and they will do something with [GPE]. They no longer respect us. They watched [GPE]. They watched our generals not knowing what they were doing. They saw all of that and they are watching very closely. They will be doing things, [GPE] will be doing things, and maybe even [GPE] will be doing things, because they are watching our country. We are psychologically weak. I built a great military. We had jet fighters that were [DATE]. We have knew everything, we are in such great shape, but you still have to have the brain power to know how to use it. And they watched that withdrawal, and by the way, the withdrawal, get out. [DATE], but you get out with dignity and strength. And we were going to get out with dignity and strength. What they did, these countries see that. And I will tell you what, we are in a much different position. With that being said, you hurt the athletes, you hurt a lot of people. I would not do it. [PERSON] tried it, it did not work. I would not do it. That is not the problem. By the way, [CARDINAL] other thing. I took in [MONEY] in taxes and tariffs from [GPE]. We never got [MONEY] for [DATE], they never paid us anything. [MONEY] and businesses were starting to come back to us. [GPE] respected our country. [GPE] respected our country. I stopped the pipeline going to Europe, [PERSON] approved it. But of course, he stopped the [FAC] pipeline in our country, and others, he is trying to stop. Now, we have a group of people, I do not know if it is [PERSON], it might not be, but we have a group of people that are destroying our country and perhaps knowingly, destroying our country. But he does not want us to rely on fossil fuels. Do you think he is doing this on purpose so that we buy electric cars? So fossil fuels are our strength. It is our advantage, and it also can fire up those big factories and those big plants. You look at what they are doing into our landscape, they are destroying our landscape, our birds, they are destroying with wind. And by the way, those turbines are all made in [GPE] and they are made in [GPE]. Yeah, I know. And if you talk about emissions, the making of those turbines, if you really go with the emissions theory, the making is so onerous to the environment that nothing they can do will ever or save anything. And as far as cars, in order to make the batteries of those cars, the electric cars, and now you are not going to have a choice because they want to go all electric. But doing that is going to cause a lot of problems for a lot of people. They do not want to go that way. They are taking our greatest asset, it is right under our feet. We are blessed as a country with tremendous energy reserves under our feet, and they do not want us to use them. [INTERVIEWED1], you were on social media and you said a lot of people were saying, You got to cool it on social media. You said, Well, that is the reason I got elected. Now that you are off social media, even despite [DATE] and the investigation, everything that happened since, the impeachment that followed, your ratings, according to some friendly polling for you are higher than they have been. Did you overrate the impact of social media? And in retrospect, will you need it if you want to run again? I think that people are seeing the great job that we did. Again, we had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We rebuilt our military, we had great military support. You look at the [NORP] support we have had, we had the best [NORP] support. I just think that people are missing us. But what about social media, [INTERVIEWED1]? But what about social media? Did it hurt you more than help you? And now that you are off it, and you see that nothing's really changed with your numbers except actually going up, do you think that you'd ever you overemphasized social media? It is strange because my numbers now are the best they have ever been. I think that is because maybe they look at the opponent and they look at what is happening to our country. Look, I think social media's important. I think we have some very bad people. I think a lot of illegal things were done with social media, you understand when they can do [CARDINAL]. If you spend [MONEY], they put you in jail. And yet here is the guy spend [MONEY] and nothing happens to him. Oh on the election. So, I think social media is fine if it is used properly. And I think we are going to have a platform that is going to be incredible and that is what is being developed right now. Will you change your approach? It is such an interesting question. I had to move fast. A country was in bad shape, I had to move fast. Some of the niceties like, let us sit down and let us talk very calm. I had to get things going fast. [GPE] was ripping us off [MONEY] a year. Europe, they sound nice, but they rip us. They are almost as bad as [GPE]. We made a new deal with [GPE]. We made a new deal with [GPE]. We made a new deal with [GPE]. We were doing a lot of things and you had to move fast, and sometimes in order to do that, you cannot I can be as nice as anybody, I think I am a nice person, but we had to move quickly. And sometimes you have to break the eggs a little bit. To make an omelet. Okay. So [INTERVIEWED1], during [DATE] as President of [GPE], you had [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] official [ORG] photographers with you at every event. Every time you were out in public, they were snapping pictures. There are [CARDINAL] of images in the vault and obviously, part of [ORG]. You have sifted through all of those. And you have put together the first book of your post presidency, it is called Our Journey Together. And this book, it is a coffee table book. It is got [CARDINAL] pictures in it. I understand you wrote all of the caption. Out of the [CARDINAL], how did you figure out which pictures went in and which ones did not? Well, it is a great question, frankly, and it is somebody who also has had some very successful books. But we wanted to do it quickly because we wanted to give people hope. Our country is just now, there is so many people they are down, and we wanted to give, we wanted to show it. It was a beautiful time. It was unfair. Nobody was ever attacked and hit like I was, but I understood that, and I got it, and I think we also gave it back to them. But we had to do something and you are right, we have [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] of pictures, but we picked pictures that we thought really represented the time. And there are a lot of beautiful pictures. Even the rallies, we have pictures of these massive rallies that we have. And the rallies right now are bigger now than even before the election, which is shocking. Normally you would think you would not have anybody show up. We had in [GPE], [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] people. As an example, we had [CARDINAL] rallies that I think were the biggest that we have ever had. We had a tremendous rally in [GPE]. We had a tremendous rally in [GPE], unbelievable rally in [GPE], but the numbers are so big and it is really, people want hope. And that is a little bit, and maybe a lot of the reason that I did this book. I think it gives people some hope and to look into a very beautiful time. In many ways, a very beautiful time. [ORG] came along and we had a fix it, and then we got it going again. So we really did it twice, and now our country's being destroyed. Does it make you want to get another four years and be the 47th president? And is it true that the first lady [PERSON], the former first lady has told you, I am not going back if you run again. No, that is not true. That is an interesting one. More fake news. No, that is not true. Fake news. All right. She was a great first lady. She did a great job. She loves the people, they love her. I see how they love her. But no, I will say this. We have to fix our country. Our country is going bad. We are not going to have a country any longer if we keep doing this. When we allow other countries to empty their prisons into our country- But what about you? [crosstalk [TIME]] do you want to be the 47th president? Do you think you are the only one to bring it back as the 47th president? Well, if you look at the poll numbers, I am, because the poll numbers are [PERCENT] and [PERCENT] approval rating now in [ORG], nobody's ever had that. And overall approval numbers are great. So, I am not going by polls. I am just saying I did it before and really did it twice. We had it at a level that has never been seen before, and then we brought it back to a level that was really good despite the [GPE] virus. And other countries, not [CARDINAL] country has fared as well as we have, not [CARDINAL] country. [INTERVIEWED1]. We did a good job. Pardon the interruption. As we were [TIME], looking at those many images from [DATE] of your administration, and you had to struggle to find the photographs for this particular book. What was, out of curiosity, [DATE] as president? Well, we had so much success. If you look at- Narrow it down to [CARDINAL], if you could, because we- If you look at right to try Okay, we got the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country. That was [DATE]. We got the biggest regulation cuts, that was a great number of days. We did Right to Try. So Right to Try, they have been trying to get it for [DATE] and I got it. That is where you can use medicine to take people that are terminally ill and allow them to see if this medicine works, and it is been incredibly successful. That would not sound as big as some of the other things we have done, but that was a very big thing. [ORG] justice as well, they are going to be making a very important ruling soon. Let us see how that works out. But I had [CARDINAL], it is very unusual to have [CARDINAL] and I got [CARDINAL] and they are very good and let us see how that all works out because right now, they are going to be making [CARDINAL] of their biggest decisions. And putting in [CARDINAL] judges throughout [GPE], it is [PERCENT] of the judges in the country. So we had a lot of big moments and I could just go on and on, but we had a lot of big moments. [INTERVIEWED1], thank you so much for coming on with us. If you are interested in pre-ordering the book, it is 45books.com. I hope you are enjoying [GPE]. I know the [INTERVIEWED1] family unfortunately, is canceled in certain states and you all moved down to [GPE], left [GPE]. I hope everyone's happy and doing well. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you very much. Thank you. All right. [INTERVIEWED1], former president of [GPE].", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentstelevisioninterviewwiththepresidentandmrsjohnsonrecordedconnectionwiththe", "text": "[INTERVIEWED1], is not this going to be a terribly lonely house with both your daughters married and gone? [PERSON], I am sure there will be moments when I will walk into [PERSON]'s room and stand quietly and look at k. And there will be those things in the mirror, you know--a snapshot, a sort of a yellowed newspaper story, a napkin with something from a party on it. And those [PERSON] drawings on the wall that she loved so well, you know, from the Winnie the Pooh books. Then I will have a sudden little wave of loneliness. But, no, not essentially. There will always be activity and excitement here. They will be coming back lots of times. Speaking of loneliness, [DATE] I walked through a room where there was a picture, a family picture of us, and I just stopped and looked at it. There were just the [CARDINAL] of us. And I thought how poor. Now we are [CARDINAL]. Well, that does not make for loneliness. That just makes for more happiness when you can get together. [INTERVIEWED2], how do you feel on that point? Very much the same. I was at the bachelors' dinner [TIME]. They asked me to make a few observations. I told them that there were many pluses and minuses in life, as I was not unaware. I have had opportunity to be reminded on occasion of the minuses, but I am not sure that I ever stressed the great pluses for me. And they were my [CARDINAL] girls--[INTERVIEWED1], and [PERSON], and [PERSON]. The thing that gives me added strength is that I have increased that number of [CARDINAL] that I look to for comfort and for strength and for help to [CARDINAL] now. Of course, [PERSON] has his own way of giving it to you. And I would not say it is effective on a mass basis yet. But [PERSON] was there and [PERSON] was there. And the increase of the family does give me increased satisfaction. We, Of course, have seen them over [DATE], [INTERVIEWED1] and [INTERVIEWED2], and have our own impressions. But I wonder if you could talk with us a bit about the differences in [PERSON]'s personality and [PERSON]'s personality. There has been a lot written and said about it. I wonder if you could talk with us what you think the differences in their personalities are? Well, they are just as different as they can be. [PERSON] is sort of the eternal [PERSON]. She is extremely feminine. She is female before she is a person--dainty, oriented toward clothes and children and house. [PERSON] is, oh, she is so intelligent and so companionable. So--she has a questing mind and a great sense of excitement in facing life. She is my best companion for a lot of things that we do together--trips, going to plays, and going to art galleries. None of that makes the slightest bit of difference in the measure that you love them, you know. I had the best little insight on that last night, [PERSON], in their differences, when we had--[PERSON] spoke of the party that he went to. Here, there was a very small one, just the bridesmaids. They did let the [CARDINAL] mothers come down for awhile. And [PERSON] wrote a poem about her life with her sister which ended with a delightful little line about as children and sisters and friends. And so they change with [DATE], you know, and they emerge as friends. And all of their differences are very, very apparent and make life a lot more exciting. [INTERVIEWED2], there are those who have said over [DATE] that [PERSON] was your favorite. Would you talk to us about the contrasting personalities of the girls? I think that I have never known many parents who had favorites among their own children. I think you see different things in different children. I think [INTERVIEWED1] has expressed it very well. They are quite different. [PERSON] writes it and [PERSON] reads it. [PERSON] very much wants to--is a very curious person and wants to know all about everything that has been written that she has heard much about. She pursues it. She digests it. She assimilates and she retains it. She is a very good student and that has been emphasized in all of her work. [PERSON], on the other hand, is very gay and not concerned with being [ORG] or leading the class or making the honor society, although her grades were quite good and we were pleased with them. But, [PERSON], instead of going to a book and enjoying a poem, would just save time by writing it. [PERSON], I expect, could prepare a pretty good cookbook and prepare a better meal. She has unique tastes. I like to think that [PERSON] is like my mother and my mother was one of my favorites, [CARDINAL] of my very special favorites. The only one I ever had to compare with her is the one that [PERSON] is like. That is [PERSON]'s mother. They are quite two different people. [CARDINAL] is a blonde. [CARDINAL] is a brunette . Both of them were good students. [CARDINAL] of them was pretty conservative and prudent and careful and business conscious. After all, [INTERVIEWED1] is the only one in our family that has ever met a payroll, you know. Mother was creative, literary, producer of plays, and producer of poems, and producer of articles, and things of that nature, and not much concerned about who was going to buy the paper or pay for the--or meet the payroll or any of the things you really have to know. The best thing of all is that they just put their own talents, combine them, into making the family, into giving to the family. I see in [PERSON] her mother every time she writes a check. I see in [PERSON] her grandmother every time she cannot find her checkbook and does not know what her balance is. [INTERVIEWED2], you once told us you were very proud of Captain [PERSON] because he did not presume to speak for you when reporters asked him what you said when he asked you for [PERSON]'s hand. What do you think of this young man who is about to marry your daughter? I like him very much. I read his press conference [DATE] and I am going to try to emulate it. I hope that I do not have to stay under fire for [TIME] as he did. I want to keep ours to [TIME]. But I think that he is a young man of unusual experience and he has made the most of it. You once indicated to us, sir, right after the engagement was announced that it was primarily [PERSON]'s decision and not one to be made by you. Oh, of course, all of their romances have been their decisions. [PERSON] and [PERSON] have had friends throughout [DATE]--some closer than others; some they were more interested in than others. But all the people they have brought in the house we have been interested in and we have tried to enjoy them and make them a part of the family--and, generally speaking, they have been. I am quite optimistic about this generation. I have liked what I have seen and what has come here and what has gone from here, and what is--and all of them that fill the rooms here [DATE], the bridesmaids and their escorts and so forth. I had to give up tutoring [PERSON] in about the 10th grade, because she had already passed me. I am pretty high on this generation. I think that Captain [PERSON] and [PERSON] are [CARDINAL] very unusual boys. And I think we are very fortunate to have them. And as near as I can see, with the many, many temptations that they have had, the embarrassments that have come from their conduct are unknown to me. [INTERVIEWED2], how does it affect a Commander in Chief, so to speak, to know that his new son-in-law is going off to a war? Well, I guess you are glad that you have a son-in-law who has had the training, [DATE] in an elite group like the [ORG], who is prepared and equipped to look after his country's interests. I feel that way about all [ORG] and the boys in the other services, too. I am grateful for them. They are a mighty fine group of people that I think we do not really appreciate enough. It is pretty hard to appreciate a man enough who is willing to give his life for your liberty. [PERSON] came out of [ORG] and by choice went in the [ORG] and has led them ever since. And I will not have any doubt about the group that he follows out there or the group that he leads. I believe that it will be well done. [INTERVIEWED1], I know that you and [PERSON] must have had long conversations just before the wedding. What pieces of advice did you give her? [INTERVIEWED2], I would be interested to know what pieces of advice you had for her. I would not really quite presume to advise her. You just live your life, you know. And then--you spend [DATE] trying not to give advice but help show and direct and train. And then it is --well, every now and then you get a nice bonus of satisfaction when you find out that they are reacting in the way that you hope they will--the wisest and right. You have not found that actually stating advice has been very effective or a good way to raise the girls? Not as orders. What I have learned from life and what I think is the wisest course, yes. Sometimes you just have to flatly state the difference between right and wrong and say this is what you ought to do. But, oh, I do not think you can sit down and give a pattern for a young girl of [DATE] who has already acquired her system of values and her beliefs about life and behavior. [INTERVIEWED2], if you could give these [CARDINAL] young people anything at all, what would it be? Well, that is very difficult for me to say. I, of course, want them, more than anything else, to have a grasp and understanding of other people. You are concerned from the time you get up until you go to sleep at [TIME] with human relationships. Over [DATE] I have tried to do that. I think that they have had unusual opportunities in that respect. Both of them have been on the platform since they were little tots. [DATE], I remember [PERSON] waking me up at [TIME] and I was rather irritated that a boy would be bringing her in that late. It was [TIME], as a matter of fact. She and I were in the home together. I got up and asked her to give an accounting why she was coming in so late. She said, Well, daddy, I have been to [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] [DATE]. And I made [CARDINAL] speeches and we are in trouble in [GPE]. That was why she was late coming in. I think that I would want them to do unto others as they would have them do unto them and that they would always try to put themselves in the other fellow's position and say, I just want to exchange positions with you and see how I would feel about that reaction. If they do that on everything from the minor to the major decisions, I believe they would have a better state of mind. I believe they would be more successful. I think they would be more satisfied with themselves. I think they would contribute more to their country. I think it is more valuable to them to understand human beings and try to engage in that objective that is primary with all of us---bettering humanity. I think that is the best way to better humanity--to understand humanity. The best way to understand humanity is to put yourself in the other fellow's position and say, If I were in his place, how would I feel about the reaction I am giving him? Am I treating him like I would like to be treated? [INTERVIEWED1] and I have tried, in our relationship with each other, to bear that in mind. I felt it so strongly that [DATE], for a [DATE] present, I gave my wife and my daughters a little watch that had the Golden Rule on it. Sometimes, particularly when the press shoves me too far, I have to look at that watch and be reminded of that and count [CARDINAL] before I respond. But I think that is about as valuable a thing as a person can have--understanding his fellow man and trying to devote his life to bettering him. [INTERVIEWED1], does one ever really become accustomed to raising daughters in a goldfish bowl? I cannot say that I have found it too difficult. There are so many counter-balancing things--so many opportunities, interesting, exciting, significant people; a sense that you are on the front row of a great drama that is unfolding and that you have an opportunity to contribute a little bitty bit to it-oh, I could not say it has been bad. It has had some annoying moments. But not much. And in line with what [PERSON] was saying [TIME] about understanding, one of the best things that ever happened to me was the opportunity when he was off in the war to work for [DATE] in his office. I do not think I ever got quite as annoyed at him afterwards for being late for dinner or being sometimes exasperated. I hope my children can somehow acquire that same sort of understanding. It helps. [INTERVIEWED2], how much of a problem has this been for you raising [PERSON] in the bright light of publicity? It has its very great advantages to me and to the children--as well as its minuses--the contacts with knowledgeable people, the interests of members of the [ORG] in young high school or college girls. I have seen [PERSON] and [PERSON] and Secretaries [PERSON] and [PERSON] and others sit around here and talk over governmental questions with [PERSON] and [PERSON] while The children do not seem to know there is a gap in age and importance. They just sit and listen and sometimes speak up a bit. This happened when I was talking to another [ORG] member about something quite private. I think it has broadened their horizons and given them different viewpoints--better understanding-and taken away some of the shyness and some of the hesitancies that would go with girls of that age. On the other hand, I have seen very cruel things happen to them because of their father's position or because of their connection with [ORG]. I have bristled a good many times. I have not written any letters yet, but I have bristled and choked myself. [PERSON] has had to pat me even [TIME] on [CARDINAL] little item where [PERSON]-something is attributed to her that she had no connection with at all--never heard of-a credibility problem. She cannot get it back though. I think that is true of all parents. Something that is unjust and hurts their child hurts them even more. My father used to say to me that you will never know what it is to be a father until you are one. He also said to me, when he would spank me as a youngster, [PERSON], this hurts me worse than it does you. I never did quite believe that. I wondered if he really knew how much it was hurting me and how could it hurt him that much. But I can see now when they are pulled in unjustly, charged with this or that, and it is untrue, no basis for it, just clear out of the air sometimes, when some person, political or otherwise, will say this, it hurts me very much. So those are the disadvantages. You can just think what would happen to [PERSON] if she had a paper cup of beer. You can think about what would happen if [PERSON] went through an orange light and her brake did not hold. It is front page. It is special shows. And it is dramatized. Maybe she is ostracized. But those, in the whole general picture, are very minor and unimportant compared to the advantages to them of the associations and the responsibilities they have, as well as their contribution to the success of their father's program. I do not know anyone who has done more to help me try to better humanity than my wife and my [CARDINAL] daughters. [PERSON], I believe, was in [CARDINAL] States, [PERSON] was approximately the same number--24 or [CARDINAL]. They made [CARDINAL] speeches a day on their own, without any ghost writers, standing up on the platform of a train or on a box or at a picnic or out with the youngsters on a college campus. And the fact that you have not read any too terrible things about them--some of the boys that have suffered unjustly, I think, because their name became associated with [CARDINAL] or the other of them at times. The kids started hurrahing them and they got into columns. That speculation started and that exaggeration came. But if I had it all to do over, I doubt that they could have a more satisfying experience than to be the children of public servants. I doubt that they could be more broad-gauged or learn more about what it is all about in life than to have had a little experience in the [ORG] and in the [ORG] and the Vice Presidency and the Presidency. After all, men like [PERSON] and [PERSON] and [PERSON], and [PERSON] and [PERSON] and folks like that are pretty good to have around with your girls and to teach them. [INTERVIEWED2], you mentioned that your father did not spare the rod with you, that he did spank you. Were you pretty heavy with the hairbrush with the girls? Well, boys are more difficult than are girls now. He was probably a difficult boy in his time. Oh, I was an outlaw compared to these dainty little girls. We have never had any problem like that with them. I think they are so good because I have had very little to do with raising them. Their mother is the one that has brought them up. [DATE] with [PERSON] I did have to--I assumed the authority and did discipline her on occasion very much to her mother's dissatisfaction and to [PERSON]'s. On [CARDINAL] occasion, I was trying to settle something that needed to be decided, and from my viewpoint, quickly with the Speaker or with someone else who might be having dinner with me. And [PERSON] was determined that she should be the center of attraction. The Speaker would be glad to have that happen because he did not want it decided anyway. I had to take [PERSON] upstairs a time or [CARDINAL] with my hand, a kind of [the President clapped his hands] on the back end, and she would-- But by the time [PERSON] came along, she gave [PERSON] all the tricks and the things not to do and we have not had any problems since then. How did you handle discipline with the girls, [INTERVIEWED1]? It is always difficult, I think, more difficult to discipline girls than it is boys. How did you handle the discipline problem? I do not think so at all. I really do not have any experience with boys. But I have not found it difficult with the girls. Well, how did you handle discipline when they did not do something that you thought they should do? Particularly as they got older. What kind of discipline did you impose on them? I just talked to them, [PERSON], and told them what I thought were the [CARDINAL] sides of it. The answer is she did not apply any, [PERSON]. She would just say, Always remember you are trusted, always remember you are loved, always remember we care and I know that you are going to do what is right. They have not had [TIME]. They have not had any limitations. They have not had any things that--you cannot smoke, you must not drink, you cannot do any of these things. We do not have them. It really got across, though, the idea about [TIME]. However we did it. They learned about not staying out too late. [INTERVIEWED1], with all these preparations going on right now-you recently observed an anniversary. Do you think back to your own wedding? Yes. Quite a bit different, was it? Very simple. [INTERVIEWED1], we are told mothers have an intuition about these things. Did you know, did you sense when [PERSON] first brought [PERSON] around that he was the one after all of her other boyfriends? [PERSON], I think the tip-off is when [PERSON] began to say--about the second time that she said, Mother, I want you to know [PERSON] better. When she begins to say--to plan that we sit down and talk, I began to sense then that this had some deeper implications, and so I was eager to do it. And I liked it. I like knowing their friends. That has been one of the good things about our life. They have brought them home, lots of them. I do not know when I have enjoyed an evening more than I did [TIME] when I sat with some oh, [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] boys. Young men, some just back from [GPE] sat at the table with us, some just going to [GPE], some professional men, some young teachers, doctors in the [DATE] age group. Some singing, and toasting and performing with jokes and things of that kind. Then I went around and met with each of them and--it was quite an exhilarating experience. I wish they were not so concealed and hidden from the [NORP] people. I wish that all [GPE] could see them en masse, just what the parents of this country have done and the kind of young man that we are producing. And I think it would make us all feel good. You do not worry about the younger generation then, [INTERVIEWED2], do you? Oh, yes, all the time. I worry about their opportunities and how they can keep their eyes on the stars and plenty of adventure and vision, how we can be on the same wavelength and still keep their feet on the ground and be realistic. The great quality of youth is its hope and its dream and its vision. We must capture all of that without--and still keep a little realism in it and make it possible. I have heard, through [DATE] here, I have heard many doubters talk about these boys-- How in the world could they ever bring [PERSON] to his knees, these [DATE], fuzzy-faced kids that have never been away from home? I have seen men get up on the floor of the [ORG] and talk about how we were going to the dogs. I heard that for [DATE] here. But then I saw those same kids in their B-17's go across both oceans, carry Old Glory around the world and bring her back without a stain on it. And it showed me then that you do not want to be too quick to judge all youth by the few exhibitionists. They are definitely in the minority. I saw that in World War II. I saw it in [GPE]. I think it is greatly emphasized now because of television. We see a few people and we think that this represents the young manhood and young womanhood of the country. It does not . It just represents the dramatic. And sometimes, we help them make it dramatic. I read [DATE] where some television company brought in the signs. The youth did not have them so they brought some of their own along, to use in case they could get pictures of the picketing. Now, maybe that college had [CARDINAL] 000 people and perhaps a scene of that kind will involve [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL]. Now, we have had that all through our life from the [NORP] period on down. They are young people. There are some of them--we do not see everything alike or we would all want the same things. But we are seeing more of the same [DATE] in small groups here. I saw a different group [TIME]. No picket signs? I saw men who loved their liberty and their freedom and who were actually dedicating their all to trying to preserve it and really believed very deeply in what they were doing. That is not to say that those who disagree with them are not equally as sincere. But I was very proud of these men who are willing to assume the responsibilities they are. I think if you look at the boy in [DATE] and look at his father in [DATE], you will see that the curve has been going upward in intelligence, in understanding, in better bodies, in better minds, in better education, in better--more material things available to them, and better living. I am glad to see it, and I think that the next [DATE] it will continue to go up. Now there are some who think it is going to the bad. But I am not one of them. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED1]. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED2]. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED2] and [INTERVIEWED1]. Thank you very much.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentstranscripttelevisionandradiointerviewconductedrepresentativesmajorbroadcast", "text": "[INTERVIEWED1], considering the violent and abrupt manner of your succession to the Presidency, I think everyone agrees that the transition has gone remarkably smoothly. Did this just happen, or did you start to plan these things, say, in [TIME] in Air Force One as you flew back from [GPE]? Well, we had a lot of help in the planning, Mr. [PERSON]. A lot of thoughts went through my mind, as I left the hospital, and on the way to Air Force One, and while we were waiting for Judge [PERSON] and Mrs. [PERSON] to come aboard. I was not sure whether this was an international conspiracy or just what it was, or what might happen next. I was sure that the whole Nation had been shaken and the world would be in doubt. As I rode back, I recognized that our first great problem was to assure the world that there would be continuity in transition, that our constitutional system would work. I realized the importance of uniting our people at home and asking them to carry forward with the program, so I immediately planned to have the bipartisan leaders come to [FAC] upon my arrival. I asked the members of the [ORG] who were then in town, the Director of [ORG] and Mr. [PERSON] and others to meet me at Andrews.1 And I appealed to all of those men to work with me on the transition and to try to so conduct ourselves as to assure the rest of the world that we did have continuity and assure the people of this country that we expected them to unite. Very shortly thereafter, President [PERSON] came down and spent some time with me exploring the problems that he expected to arise confronting a new President. President [PERSON] came in and gave me his counsel, and we started off with the help and plans of a good many people and substantially well organized. I do not know how well the Government did its part of the transition, but the people's part was well done. What were your first priorities, [INTERVIEWED1]? The first priority was to try to display to the world that we could have continuity and transition, that the program of President [PERSON] would be carried on, that there was no need for them to be disturbed and fearful that our constitutional system had been endangered. To demonstrate to the people of this country that although their leader had fallen, and we had a new President, that we must have unity and we must close ranks, and we must work together for the good of all [GPE] and the world. Well, did you have any concern about the international posture that you must adopt so that, [CARDINAL], all of our allies would be reassured, and our potential enemies would not get any wrong ideas? Oh, yes. And I spent [DATE] meeting with [CARDINAL] representatives from the nations of the world, and trying to explain to them our constitutional system, and what they could expect under it and how we would carry on the program that we had begun. And that I had been a part of the [PERSON]-Johnson ticket that won the election in [DATE]; that we had a [PERSON]-Johnson program, that I had been a participant in the formulation of that program and that we would carry it on, maybe not as well as the late President could have, had he lived, but as best we could, and they need have no fear or no doubt. What was the image that you wanted the potential enemy to get? That we were sure and we were confident, that we were united, that we had closed ranks, and not to tread on us. [INTERVIEWED1], on [DATE] both the President and you, the Vice President, were in the same city, and [CARDINAL] Cabinet officers were in the same airplane, going to [GPE]. Has there been any dispositions or regulations since to avoid such concentration? Yes, I do not think that we realized at that time that so many [ORG] officers were on this trip to [GPE]. And of course in retrospect we can see a good many things that took place that we wish we had made better plans for. But immediately upon returning to [GPE], I made it clear to the [ORG] that we did not want any goodly number like that leaving town at the same time, and that when the President and the next in line of succession were out of town, that we wanted most of the [ORG] here. And the President since that time has not been out of town with any appreciable number of [ORG] officers absent. Is there anything that can be done, sir, to afford better physical protection for the President when he travels? Not that I know of. I am not an expert on security, but we have very dedicated and faithful men in the [ORG] and in [ORG]. They work together. Do you always follow their instructions, sir? Yes, with rare exceptions now and then, like marching in the funeral procession. And occasionally, they prefer to have [CARDINAL] policemen between me and the crowds, and I ask them to move out so I can see some of the people. I want to be a people's President, and in order to do so, you have to see the people and talk to them and know something about them and not be too secluded. I think they would feel better if the President kept [QUANTITY] distance from every human being, but that is not practical. Well, when you got back here, [CARDINAL] of your--obviously [CARDINAL] of your immediate jobs was to keep the Government going as a matter of effective politics and leadership. How, specifically, did you think you would go about that? How did you let it be known in [GPE] that there was a new man here, that things are going to continue more or less as they had been, and how did you think was the best way to make it as smooth as possible? First, to ask the very unusually talented individuals that had associated themselves with the [PERSON] administration to stay at their posts of duty during this critical period, and without exception they answered the call. Second, I called the Governors together and made an appeal to them to help me in every way they could in establishing this confidence and letting the people of the country know that their Government was going on and functioning, and was strong, and that it would work. And [TIME] after [TIME], day after day, [DATE], I--while I was preparing my message to the [ORG], preparing to go on television to the people, and the [DATE] message, I was spending my [DATE] and nights, and way into the mornings, talking to the leaders out in the [GPE] and trying to instill confidence in them and to ask them to help me with the awesome responsibilities that were mine. [INTERVIEWED1], is there any one particular memory that is more vivid than the others for you, from [DATE]? Yes. I have rarely been in the presence of greatness, but as I went through that period, I observed Mrs. [PERSON], [PERSON], I saw her greatness, her gallantry, her graciousness, her courage, and it will always be a vivid memory, and I will always appreciate the strength that came to me from knowing her and from associating with her. Did you send any kind of private messages to Chairman [PERSON] soon after you became President? No. We had representatives from all the nations here. I spent [DATE] speaking to those representatives. Mr. [PERSON] was here, and I had a long visit with him, and I talked to him about the visit that Premier [PERSON] had paid me when I was leader in the [ORG], and we exchanged views for a period of time here in the office, just about the time of the funeral. Did the subject come up of a possible exploratory, get-acquainted session with Mr. [PERSON]? No. We both expressed desire in our discussion that we understand each other better and that we would be glad to meet at some time when we felt that the agenda was such that would give promise of reaching some solution to the many problems that confront the [CARDINAL] countries. But no definite plans were made for a meeting. None were proposed, but it was accepted as a possibility. You mentioned, [INTERVIEWED1], part of the reason for the transition being so smooth was that your predecessor's Cabinet and staff stayed or In fact, they are still here almost intact. Would you expect it to continue that way? Would you-- I would certainly hope so. Each [ORG] member stayed, most of the Under Secretaries are here, most of the Assistant Secretaries. We have brought in [CARDINAL] young men who have been associated with me through [DATE], and we have lost Mr. [PERSON] and Mr. [PERSON]. But basically the staff is the same, the duties are the same. The work goes on [DATE] just as it did when Mr. [PERSON] was here. [INTERVIEWED1], I wonder if you could talk a moment about this problem of Presidential succession. I think you have not endorsed any of the specific proposals that are up for discussion now. But oughtn't there be some mechanism so that there would always be a Vice President? Yes; and I think the [ORG] is giving attention to that, and I think it is quite proper that they do, and I have no doubt that in [DATE] when we select the Vice President--but what is very likely is that the [ORG] will take some action, I do not know just what kind of action, to make it possible to replace the Vice President if he becomes President. I think it is important that we do that. I do not have any deep-set views on just how that should be done. I participated in passing the measure that establishes the line of succession now, and I think that that is very good. President [PERSON] sat down with me in [DATE] of his administration and discussed the possibilities of a takeover, a transition, if the President became disabled. We had an oral agreement on what should be done under those circumstances. The first--one of the first things I did was to ask the distinguished Speaker of the [ORG] to come to my office, and I made an agreement with him exactly as President [PERSON] had made with Vice President [PERSON], and as President [PERSON] had made with me, and that is now in writing and in existence if I should become disabled. But the [ORG] should consider replacing the Vice President when they have one no more. They are doing that now. I rather doubt that they will explore all the angles of it and make any realistic progress toward constitutional amendments or the necessary statutes [DATE], but I am sure once we have a Vice President that they will face up to it and take prompt action. Have not we really reached a point in the history of this country where the selection of a vice presidential candidate must be nothing but his competence for the highest office? Yes, I would hope that the only thing that would appeal to any delegate would be this question: Is this the best equipped and best trained and best fitted man to serve as President should he be called on to do so ? Yet it is a choice which is peculiarly that of the presidential candidate, is it not, sir? I think that the delegates are always interested in getting the recommendations of the President, and in most instances, not all instances, but most instances, the presidential nominee makes his recommendation. I do not --I recall [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] instances where the President chose not to make any recommendation. But the Vice President is very close to the President. They have to agree on the same platform, they have to run on the same ticket. In order to be prepared for what might happen the President must have great confidence in the Vice President, and make known to him his thoughts, his views, and all of his secrets, so that he can have the background for taking over if it becomes necessary, so the President's recommendation should not be treated lightly. There have been reports, [INTERVIEWED1], that you have become displeased with Attorney General [PERSON] because efforts have been made in his behalf to have him nominated for Vice President. There even have been published reports that you are not even speaking. Is there any truth in those reports? No. The Attorney General's statement, I think, was a very good one, [DATE]. I think most of that is newspaper talk. I would be less than frank if I said that I thought that it was wise at this stage of the game for either the President or the Vice President to be carrying on a campaign for the office. The Attorney General and I have talked about that, and I think he understands my viewpoint, and I take his word that he has done nothing to encourage those efforts, and all of this stuff that you read about is newspaper talk. Well, speaking of newspaper talk, [INTERVIEWED1], it is widely believed among the reporters around town that you object rather strongly to being criticized in the papers and on the air. Would you give us what your true feelings on that subject are? How do you feel about it? I assume that almost anyone is human and would rather have approval than disapproval. [INTERVIEWED1], [PERSON] once said in a similar conversation [DATE] or more that he thought the press ought to be as tough as it could be on any administration, so long as it was after truth and not merely a political operation. Is that a good definition of your views? I would have no objection to that. I would agree to it, and I do not think--it is not the toughness of the press that any President objects to. I think it is sometimes their inaccuracies and--I frequently see stories from [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] papers that I think are quite accurate, very well done. On occasion, you will see something that is reported as a truth that you never heard of, where you are the principal participant. And if you call attention to it, then you become sensitive. How many papers do you read a day, sir? I guess [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL]. [INTERVIEWED1], during [DATE] there has been [CARDINAL] persistent political issue, which is the investigation of [PERSON] in the [ORG], aimed at you because he was your protg and your friend. As a political animal, sir, what is your estimate of this as a campaign issue in [DATE]? Well, without agreeing with your assumptions about why the investigation or who it is aimed at, I would say that [CARDINAL] of the finest committees in the [ORG] made up of Members of both parties have been conducting this investigation of an employee of theirs--no protg of anyone; he was there before I came to the [ORG] for [DATE], doing a job substantially the same as he is doing now, he was elected by all the Senators, appointed by no one, including the [NORP] Senators--and I think that their investigation will be a just one, and a fair one, and that they will make recommendations to the [ORG] that will be proper, and whatever they recommend I am sure the [ORG] will carry out. Well, quite apart from what the [ORG] committee may recommend, sir, have you formed a personal judgment, a judgment for yourself? You and Mr. [PERSON] used to be friends. Do you continue to be friends? I have not seen him since he resigned from the [ORG] or have not talked to him since he resigned from the [ORG], and I think every man is entitled to a fair trial and I would like to see what conclusion is reached and what the evidence shows with which I am not familiar before I would make a judgment. [INTERVIEWED1], if I could make you a self-critic for a moment, what, if anything, that has happened in these last 120 days would you do differently were you to do it again? Well, I do not know about that. I am sure that we have made a good many mistakes, but I do not know of any recommendation I have made that I would change. I would favor the same measures that I have recommended to the [ORG]. I would handle the developments and the foreign policy fields such as [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE], [GPE], just as we have handled them. So while I am sure that we could improve on them if we had more time, in the light of what developed I would not change any. I believe the first big problem you had to tackle was the budget, the time for making final decisions, and you devoted nearly all of [DATE] to this. Why was the budget so terribly important? Because I think it told the people of the country and the people of the [ORG] what you are willing to pay for. And if I had it to do over again, I would much prefer to have [DATE] than to have [DATE] to make a budget of [MONEY]. We have been adding to our budget [MONEY] a year. We had [MONEY] in built-in increases. Our last budget was [MONEY]. So my big problem was to find ways and means of cutting money out of the budget that we did not need, and we did not need to appropriate, and we could save in order to have some money available to meet the many untilled needs we had--particularly in the welfare field, in the poverty field, in the training of manpower field. During the budget cutting, [INTERVIEWED1], you made [CARDINAL] little talk which caused some controversy in which you said that to meet the untilled needs of the people you would take from the haves and give to the have-nots. Now, just how did you mean that? Well, we have a budget of [MONEY] in [ORG]. We have those installations set up, and those needs have been planned for. We no longer find they are necessary. They have the money. We say to them that we are going to take from this picture [CARDINAL] bases that you now have, we are going to close those bases, we are going to take some of these overseas employees and cut them [PERCENT], and have some people double-up on our jobs, and squeeze out additional productivity. And out of that money that we save, money that we have, and have used for these purposes, we are going to take it over here and take the young boys that have dropped out of school and have nothing to do, and no job and no work, and unemployed, and we are going to try to train them to be good citizens. You meant, [INTERVIEWED1], to redivide the money amongst the Government agencies, not some kind of a new soak-the-rich scheme as some interpreted this take from the haves and give to the have-nots ? No, we made no recommendations on soaking anybody. We are reducing taxes, not increasing them. Our tax reduction is in excess of [MONEY], [MONEY] plus for individuals, everyone is the beneficiary of that already, and corporation taxes have been reduced [MONEY], so we were not soaking anyone. But we were taking money that was being used for things that we did not need, or that we could avoid, and taking that money and applying it to meet the untilled needs of our poverty-stricken people. President [PERSON] talked about the third that were ill clad, ill fed, and ill housed. [DATE] we have worked on it but there is still [CARDINAL] of the people that earn [MONEY], 000 a year. So out of [CARDINAL] that we cut from the [ORG] budget we will add [CARDINAL] in the new budget for a poverty program. So it will come from those who have it, to those do not have it. Have you had any second thoughts, [INTERVIEWED1], about erecting another agency to deal with root causes of poverty--health is one, education and other things--on top of the agencies and departments that already exist that have been dealing with these things? No, we are going to have a very small staff to coordinate the poverty program. We realize it is a beginning, it is not an extremely comprehensive program. We are going to have [PERSON] in charge of coordinating the program between the agencies who already are working in that field: [ORG]; [ORG] in the dealings with the juvenile delinquency; [ORG] in health and education; [ORG] in training manpower. And we do not want to create more agencies, we want to use the ones we have. So the President is going to have as his chief of staff, a poverty director, administrator, and through him his orders will be carried out through existing agencies. [INTERVIEWED1], [DATE] are over now, and the transition is over. This is now the [PERSON] administration. Could you give us an idea--not necessarily specific, unless you care to--what direction you would say your administration would take hereafter? What new approaches or ideas or philosophies we might see? Well, I think a message going to the [ORG] on [DATE] will indicate [CARDINAL] approach.2 We are determined, and we have a group of dedicated men that are going to try to get at the roots and the causes of poverty that cause [PERCENT] of our people to live off of [MONEY], 000 a year. We are going to try to get at the roots and the causes and find the solution to doing something [CARDINAL] men that are rejected [DATE] because of mental or physical reasons for service. We are going to try to recognize and proceed on the basis that illiteracy and ignorance and disease cost this Government [MONEY] per year, and make for much unhappiness. And the program of poverty [DATE] is [CARDINAL] example of what I would like to think will be carried on, and grow in [DATE] to come. I want this Government first of all to be dedicated to peace in our time, and do everything that we can conceivably do, any place, any time, with anyone, to resolve some of the differences that exist among mankind. In order to do that, this Government must be prepared and we must maintain strength and power that would insure our safety if attacked. In order to have peace, and to be prepared, we must be solvent and fiscally responsible. So for that reason we have tried to eliminate waste at every corner. I do not believe that we are going to make the [ORG] over by cutting out a few automobiles or turning out a few lights. But I do think it is a good example when you walk through the corridor and you see the closets where lights burn [TIME] and [TIME] just because someone did not turn them off. So we have tried to set that example and we want a Government that is seeking peace, that is prepared for any eventuality, that is fiscally solvent and that is compassionate, that meets the needs of the people for health and for education, and for physical and mental and spiritual strength. And our Government-that is the kind of a [PERSON] administration I would like to have and that is the kind that we are working towards. [INTERVIEWED1], administrations come to have rather handy labels, [ORG], or [ORG], or [ORG], or [ORG]. Has any ever come to your mind for the [PERSON] administration? No, I do not think so. I have had a lot of things to deal with [DATE], and I have not thought of any slogan, but I suppose all of us want a better deal, do not we? [INTERVIEWED1], I do not want to overdo the business of labels, but many of us have long been a little baffled watching your career in the [ORG] and now here as to whether to call you a conservative or liberal, or [NORP] or [NORP]. How do you think of yourself if you apply those labels at all to yourself? Well, I do not believe in labels. I want to do the best I can, all the time. I want to be progressive without getting both feet off. the ground at the same time. I want to be prudent without having my mind closed to anything that is new or different. I have often said that I was proud that I was a free man first and an [NORP] second, and a public servant third and a [NORP] fourth, in that order, and I guess as a [NORP], if I had to take--place a label on myself, I would want to be a progressive who is prudent. While we are talking about [NORP], [INTERVIEWED1], what is your timing on your [DATE] effort? I would hope that we would not have to--we would not have to begin an active campaign--[ORG]--until around convention time, after the [ORG] disposed of its business. I am going to carry out some commitments that President [PERSON] made for fund-raising dinners from time to time, but I think after the convention we will have ample time to give our views to the people. In the meantime, I would like to have the cooperation of the members of both parties in carrying out a program that is best for [GPE]. I am the only President this country has, and I would like to be as free from partisanship as possible, at least until the convention. Well, [INTERVIEWED1], in this interim between now and the convention, do you think we might see a few old-fashioned, nonpolitical conservation tours or inspection tours of that kind? We will see them before and after the convention. They are part of the work of the President. I think part of the President's job is to get out and see the people and talk to them about what the Government is doing and make reports. That is why I am on this--having this little visit with you fellows [TIME], so that the people may know something about my views and how I feel and my approaches, and may know how much I need them and need their help in the job that I am trying so hard to do. [INTERVIEWED1], some people have thought that you put in too long and hard a day, that you might endanger your own health that way. How do you protect your health from day to day? We do have long days, and the problems that require attention require time. And you never have as much time as you want to spend before making these decisions, but you must make decisions. [DATE] were filled almost to the breaking point. But I have adjusted myself to the schedule and with the help of the most competent people that President [PERSON] surrounded himself with, I am now able--I wake up in the morning and read my papers and read the documents that were left over from [TIME] that I need to pass upon and have my briefings, and my breakfast, and come to the office [TIME]. Then I work at a rather feverish rate until [TIME]. And I have a swim and take out [TIME]. Then I go and have a lunch or--usually a business lunch, working lunch, and [TIME] I take a little nap of [TIME], and that breaks [DATE] for me, and then I am good until [TIME] that night, and have my dinner. After dinner I see TV news, and then I engage in my night reading, and I usually read until [TIME]. I do not require too much sleep. But I am never in better health. I enjoy the work that I am doing, and the people with whom I am working. I never felt better in my life. [INTERVIEWED1], you did manage to quit cigarette smoking [DATE]. Have you any advice for those of us who have not managed? I gave up cigarette smoking because the doctor recommended that I do so, and I have missed it [DATE], but I have not gone back to it, and I am glad that I have not . [INTERVIEWED1], I gather from what you say that we need not expect any kind of political announcements from you until very close to the convention. Is that so? I would not want to preclude one. Unless I--there is substantial consideration involved--I see no reason to make any now, and I do not anticipate it, but if the circumstances indicated that one would be fruitful or necessary, I would not hesitate to face up to it. While we are on politics, I wonder--we have heard everybody else's analysis of what happened in [GPE]. Would you give us yours? I really do not know. I think that we always incline to put too much emphasis on the actions of [CARDINAL] primary. But it seemed to me that the people of the [ORG] heard all the candidates and decided to select [CARDINAL] of their neighbors that apparently they knew and approved. I have very high regard for Ambassador [PERSON] myself, as I do for some of the other candidates. Has his serving in [ORG] during a political campaign been at all awkward or embarrassing for the administration? Not to the President. So far as I have been able to detect from his actions, he has been doing nothing but the job as ambassador, and doing it as best he could, and I have seen nothing that has interfered with that work. Did Secretary [PERSON] bring you any new word from Mr. [PERSON] just recently when he returned, about Mr. [PERSON]'s future plans, how long he might stay on the job, and so forth? No, no. I have had no indication that he plans to leave the job at all, and if he did, I am sure he would let me know, Secretary [PERSON] brought me some recommendations concerning the situation out in [GPE], in which Ambassador [PERSON] expressed his views, and in which they were in general agreement with Mr. [PERSON] and other members of the team, but nothing political. Is it your opinion that Mr. [PERSON] has behaved properly and within the scope of his role as an ambassador, considering that he has been injected into the political arena? Yes. You have had reports in [DATE] or [CARDINAL] from the Ambassador to [GPE] and from Secretary [PERSON]. Can you tell us anything of what he reported to you from [ORG]? Yes, he made a very lengthy report and I think a responsible and constructive one. We are going to consider it in [ORG] further the early part of [DATE]. We have problems in [GPE] as we have had for [DATE]. Secretary [PERSON] has been out there; this is his fourth trip. We are very anxious to do what we can to help those people preserve their own freedom. We cherish ours and we would like to see them preserve theirs. We have furnished them with counsel and advice, and men and materiel to help them in their attempts to defend themselves. If people would quit attacking them we'd have no problem, but for [DATE] this problem has been going on. I was reading a letter [DATE] that General [PERSON] wrote to the late President [PERSON] [DATE], [DATE] and it is a letter that I could have well written to President [PERSON] and sent out by Mr. [PERSON]. Now, we have had that problem for a long time. We are going to have it for some time in the future, we can see, but we are patient people, and we love freedom, and we want to help others preserve it, and we are going to try to evolve the most effective and efficient plans we can to continue to help them. President [PERSON] said, on the subject of [GPE]-Nam, I think, that he did believe in the falling domino theory, that if Viet-Nam were lost that other countries in the area would soon be lost. I think it would be a very dangerous thing, and I share President [PERSON]'s view, and I think the whole of Southeast Asia would be involved and that would involve [CARDINAL] of people, and I think it is --it cannot be ignored, we must do everything that we can, we must be responsible, we must stay there and help them, and that is what we are going to do. [INTERVIEWED1], during the [GPE] primary campaign, Governor [PERSON] criticized what he called divided counsel that was going out from [GPE] to the leaders of [ORG]. He said that while you and Secretary [PERSON] and Secretary [PERSON] were committed to winning the war and defeating the Viet Cong, the [ORG] majority leader, Senator [PERSON], seemed to find favor with the idea of neutralization advanced by President [PERSON] of [GPE]. What is your reaction to Governor [PERSON]'s criticism? Well, I think the Governor should know that Senator [PERSON] is very experienced in the field of foreign relations, and serves as a distinguished member of that committee, and when he made his speech in the [ORG], 4 he spoke for himself, and so stated. He was not speaking the administration viewpoint and he did not leave any such impression. From time to time he has given me his counsel over [DATE] in this general area of Southeast Asia, but when he made this speech he spoke for himself entirely, and there is no division in the administration between Secretary [PERSON] and Secretary [PERSON] and myself. We all feel alike on the matter. I think that there could even be some division between Mr. [PERSON] and Mr. [PERSON], judging from what you have said. Mr. [PERSON] sees things pretty much as we do, and we are going to continue with our program, and it is going to be a responsible one, and we think a fruitful one. Do the recommendations that Secretary [PERSON] brought back from his last trip envisage a continuing role for Mr. [PERSON] in handling policies in South Viet-Nam? Yes. Yes, he has a very important role. He met with me in my office [DATE] after I became President, and I said to him at that time that You are my top man there, and I want you to have the kind of people you want, and I want you to carry out the program you recommend and you will have our support here. He has worked very hard at that job and we have sent him some new people from time to time, and we will be sending more. He has command of the full resources that we have out there, and he works very well with our people. [CARDINAL] of your speeches at [ORG] indicated a kind of hint to me that we might carry the war to [NORP] if they did not quit meddling in what you call a dangerous game. Are there any such plans that you can talk about at this time, sir? No, and I made no such hint. I said it was a dangerous game to try to supply arms and become an aggressor and deprive people of their freedom, and that is true, whether it is in [GPE] or whether it is in this hemisphere, wherever it is. [INTERVIEWED1], do we face the decision on [ORG] of the order of magnitude of [GPE], for example? No, I do not think so. I think that we have problems there. We have difficulties there. We have had for [DATE], and as I told you, a good many things have come and gone during that period of time; as long as there are people trying to preserve their freedom, we want to help them. Well, [INTERVIEWED1], not only do we have a new administration in this country, but we also have what might be described as a new world, since it is said now that the postwar world is over, and the [NORP] leadership is challenged and questioned both by friend and enemy alike in many places now. So it is an entirely different world, very different world, from what it was [DATE]. What is your view and assessment of it ? How do you see the [NORP] role from here on, now that we are no longer the unquestioned leader of the entire West? Well, I think that as long as we are living in a world with [CARDINAL] nations, that we have got to realize that we have got [CARDINAL] foreign policies. And we are living in a world where we recognize [CARDINAL] other nations, and some that we do not recognize, and so I think at this time that our Nation is held in high esteem and respect and affection generally among the peoples of the world, the free world. I realize that we have discouraging incidents from time to time, and we have problems, and because we try to help with those problems, sometimes the role of the peacemaker is not a very happy one. And so, for that reason, we have to do things that we do not want to do sometimes, and are rather irritating--and sometimes we are abused because we do them, and sometimes we are misunderstood. But if the final result is good, then our action is justified. [INTERVIEWED1], [DATE] an [NORP] Secretary of [ORG] termed neutrality as something immoral. Not long ago President [PERSON] talked about making the world safe for diversity. Is a more and more diverse world, with the diminishing of the importance of great alliances, a trend toward a safer world? Yes, I think so. And you must remember this: that we are having all the new nations that are emerging, and they are coming in without experience, and they have their pride. A good many of them have the feelings that--pent-up feelings, that they have nurtured for [DATE] and [DATE]. And they have an opportunity to express themselves, and sometimes it looks a little odd for the Prime Minister of a new country to come in with a pistol in his hand and arrest an [NORP] charge d'affaires. But that does happen, and we have to be prepared for those developments and try to understand them and try to provide leadership that will keep us from getting in deeper water or more trouble, and that is what we are doing. Sometimes our people become very impatient. They cut the water off on us in [GPE], and I got a good many recommendations from all over the country as to how to act very quickly. Some of them said--some of the men wanted me to run in the [NORP], send them in immediately. Well, upon reflection and evaluation and study, realizing not many people want more war, and none of them really want more appeasement, you have to find a course that you can chart that will preserve your dignity and self-respect, and still bring about the action that is necessary. So instead of sending in the [NORP] to turn the water on, we sent [CARDINAL] admiral in to cut it off and arrange to make our own water, and we think things worked out as best they could under those circumstances. But there are going to be these demands from time to time, from people who feel that all we need to do is mash a button and determine everybody's foreign policy. But we are not living in that kind of a world any more. They are going to determine it for themselves, and that is the way it should be. And we are going to have to come and reason with them and try to lead them instead of force them. And I think, I have no doubt but what for [DATE] to come that we will be a leading force in molding opinion of the world, and I think the better they know us the more they will like us. Is there any progress, [INTERVIEWED1], in the deadlock over [GPE] and the absence of diplomatic relations with that country? We have been very close to agreement several times. I have no doubt but what agreement will be reached that will, in effect, provide for sitting down with the [NORP] authorities and discussing the problems that exist between us and being guided only by what is fair and what is right and what is just, and trying to resolve those problems. Now, when that will come about, I do not know. We are anxious and willing and eager to do it any time it suits their convenience. What is the hitch right now, [INTERVIEWED1]? I think first, they have an election on, and I think translating our language into their language, that some of the agreements that we have to discuss these matters, they perhaps feel that they would want stronger language than we are willing to agree to, and we want a different expression from what they want. It is largely a matter of trying to agree on the kind of language that will meet their problems, and that we can honestly, sincerely agree to. We are not going to agree to any preconditions to negotiate a new treaty without knowing what it is going to be in that treaty and without sitting down and working it out on the basis of equity. We think that that language can be resolved and will be resolved in due time. [INTERVIEWED1], what is your assessment now of General [PERSON]'s behavior in [DATE] or [CARDINAL]? What do you think about it? Well, it is not for me to pass judgment on-- In relation to us, sir? --on General [PERSON]'s conduct. My conversations with him have been very pleasant. I would like to see him more in agreement on matters with us than he is, such as recognizing Red [GPE]. We did not think that was wise for [GPE] or for us or for the free world. But that is [GPE]'s foreign policy. That is not ours, and in his wisdom he decided he would follow that course, and that is a matter for him to determine. What do you hear from the people at [ORG], [INTERVIEWED1]? Has the fact of [NORP] recognition now increased the prospect that [NORP] may be voted into membership at the [ORG]? The situation changes from time to time, but we do not think that they will be voted into membership, and we hope not. I do not believe they will. What would be our reaction vis-a-vis the [ORG] if they were admitted? Well, we will have to cross that bridge--I do not want to admit that they are going to be admitted and do not think they will. Senator [PERSON], for example, has argued that we should withdraw at once if the Red [NORP] are admitted. Well, that is Senator [PERSON]'s view, and I do not think they are going to be admitted, and I do not think we will have to face that question. [CARDINAL] you do have to face soon, [INTERVIEWED1], is to say something to [ORG] about foreign aid. That seems to have reached a peak of opposition. It seems to have reached some kind of peak [DATE]. What do you think the future of it is? I think it is going to be very tough to get a good foreign aid measure through the [ORG] [DATE]. [DATE] President [PERSON] asked for [MONEY]. He later had that request carefully studied and he reduced it to [MONEY]. He got a [MONEY] appropriation--after I came to office. I signed the bill and there was reappropriated [MONEY] unexpended balances, [MONEY]. Now, I have conferred with the leaders in the [ORG] and [ORG] on that matter, and they all admit it is going to be more difficult [DATE] than it ever has been before, although I do not think that is justified. Nevertheless, I request--we are not going to pad our request. We got [MONEY] 4 [DATE], and we will ask for something in the neighborhood of that for [DATE], and we will ask only what we need, and we hope we get what we ask, but it will be appreciably under what was asked [DATE], and approximately the same that we got [DATE]. We think that we are justified in spending [MONEY] of our tax dollar to protect the [CARDINAL] men who are in uniform, our men, scattered throughout the world, and to keep them from going into combat, and this is the best weapon that I have. [INTERVIEWED1], is there any [CARDINAL] root cause for the apparent slowness of [ORG]? Yes. It is very difficult to get [CARDINAL] nations to all agree and get their Systems changed and their reforms effected and to blend into their governmental philosophy the modernization that is going to be required to make [ORG] a success. We are distressed that it has not been more successful, but we have not lost faith. We are having a meeting [DATE] with all of the Ambassadors from [ORG]. We are having a meeting [DATE] with all the Ambassadors from the Western Hemisphere. We are calling in all of our own Ambassadors, and the [CARDINAL] groups are going to meet, and we are going to point out the weaknesses and the slowness of certain reforms that are required and the cooperation that we must have from their countries because there is no use of making big investments and taking our taxpayers funds unless these reforms are effective. And we are going to make an appeal for a united attack that will give new life to [ORG] and we have hopes that it will be successful. [INTERVIEWED1], are you terribly disturbed about the resort to street protests and demonstrations on civil rights and other things that are taking place now almost all over the country? I think that when the [ORG] acts upon the civil rights bill, that we will have the best civil rights law that has been enacted in [DATE], and I think it will be a substantial and effective answer to our racial problems. The Negro was freed of his chains [DATE], but he has not been freed of the problems brought about by his color and the bigotry that exists. And this bill goes a long way to taking the battle from the streets into the legislative halls and into the courthouses, and into where these differences should be settled. Of course, we have a right to petition, and we should petition when we have grievances, but I think the most effective thing that can be done--and I think great progress has been made under the leadership of President [PERSON] and the Attorney General and others in [DATE] is getting all the people of the Nation to accept their moral responsibility and take some leadership in this field where there has been so much discrimination. And I know of nothing more important for this [ORG] to do than to pass the Civil Rights Act as the [ORG] passed it. And I hope that can be done after due deliberation. I think it will be a great step forward for the [ORG]. I think it will make us much more united, and I cannot think of any single thing we can do to strengthen [NORP] foreign policies more than to pass the [ORG] civil rights bill in the [ORG]. You are confident that you can get a civil rights bill substantially like the [ORG] bill without major modification? We want to very much, and we are going--the [ORG] will have to work its will and we believe that a substantial majority favors the [ORG] bill, and we believe in due time it will be able to work its will. Well, are you concerned, [INTERVIEWED1], at what might happen if this filibuster is still going in [DATE] when the schools are out and the kids are out and have idle time on their hands? I do not want to predict that the [ORG] will be--how long it will be discussing this bill. I am hopeful and I am an optimist and I believe they can pass it and I believe they will pass it and I believe it is their duty to pass it, and I am going to do everything I can to get it passed. [INTERVIEWED1], you have now been President for something over [DATE]. You have been around [GPE] for [DATE]. How is the view from the inside as compared with the view from the outside? Well, it is a much tougher job from the inside than I thought it was from the outside. I have watched it since Mr. [PERSON]'s days, and I realize the responsibilities it carried and the obligations of leadership that were there, and the decisions that had to be made, and the awesome responsibilities of the office. But I must say that when I started having to make those decisions and started hearing from the [ORG], that the Presidency looked a little different when you are in the Presidency than it did when you are in the [ORG], and vice versa. [INTERVIEWED1], [PERSON] referred to the office as a splendid misery. [PERSON] used to talk about it as if it were a prison cell. Do you like it? I am doing the best I can in it, and I am enjoying what I am doing. [PERSON] said the second office of the land was an honorable and easy one. The Presidency was a splendid misery. But I found great interest in serving in both offices, and it carries terrific and tremendous and awesome responsibilities but I am proud of this Nation, and I am so grateful that I could have an opportunity that I have had in [GPE] that I want to give my life seeing that the opportunity is perpetuated for others. I am so proud of our system of government, of our free enterprise, where our incentive system and our men who head our big industries are willing to get up at daylight and work until [TIME] to offer employment and create new jobs for people, where our men working there will try to get decent wages but will sit across the table and not act like cannibals, but will negotiate and reason things out together. I am so happy to be a part of a system where the average per capita income is in excess of $[MONEY] per month, when there are [CARDINAL] nations in the entire world that have [MONEY] per month. And while [GPE] has [CARDINAL] times as many tillable acres of land as we have and a population that is in excess of ours and a great many resources that we do not have that if properly developed would exceed our potential in water and oil and so forth, nevertheless we have [CARDINAL] thing they do not have, and that is our system of private enterprise, free enterprise, where the employer, hoping to make a little profit, the laborer hoping to justify his wages, can get together and make a better mousetrap. They have developed this into the most powerful and the leading nation in the world, and I want to see it preserved. And I have an opportunity to do something about it as President. And I may not be a great President, but as long as I am here, I am going to try to be a good President, and do my dead level best to see this system preserved because when the final chips are down, it is not going to be the number of people we have or the number of acres or the number of resources that win, the thing that is going to make us win is our system of government. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED1].", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintjournalists2", "text": "Just a couple of comments. [CARDINAL], I am looking forward to going to [ORG]. It is always a good opportunity to talk about common values, common interests, ways we can work together to improve the world. I am looking forward to seeing the leaders. I have got a good personal relationship with the leaders. It is a good chance to visit. Agenda items are-important agenda items: [GPE], I just gave a speech on the continent of Africa; global climate change, it is important to move the debate beyond the [GPE] era and talk about what we can do together to improve the environment. I am looking forward to that. [CARDINAL] of the things there has not been much focus on is, there will be time to discuss progress in the Middle East-the Middle East peace process. [PERSON] is coming to discuss a way forward, how we can all help the [NORP] improve their security, enhance the entrepreneurial spirit so people can see their lives improve. We are looking forward to that. Anyway, it is going to be a good trip. I am looking forward to going to [GPE]. The Prime Minister is a friend. He is a good man. He is got a good, strong backbone. When he says he is going to do something, he means it. I am looking forward to seeing [PERSON]. It is going to be a good experience. I have never been to [GPE], so I am looking forward to going. [PERSON], we will start with you, and then we will do a couple of rounds, and I will let you all go get some lunch. All right. My first question really is an aid question, with respect to Africa. Mr. [PERSON] has really been pressing this issue of dramatically increased aid to Africa. You have substantially increased [GPE] assistance to Africa, but on the other hand, it falls way short of what Mr. [PERSON] has been asking for. You have been really, I think, fairly cool to both the [MONEY] that he is asked and the commitment for, what is it, [PERCENT] of GDP for foreign assistance. A couple of comments on that. [CARDINAL] is that our aid increase has been dramatic. We have tripled our aid since I have been President, and I just announced [DATE] that I will ask [ORG] to double it by [DATE], which is a significant increase. Secondly, though, you have got to look at Africa as more than just aid. Aid is [CARDINAL] aspect of participating on the continent in a compassionate way. Trade is a vital part of lifting people out of poverty. The other thing is, you know, there is all kinds of ways to calculate generosity. I happen to think that the formula that some people try to use is not an effective way to judge [GPE]'s generosity or a fair way. For example, we have got a Tax Code structure to encourage private citizens to contribute. And so I will remind our [ORG] friends that aid to developing countries is more than just grants from Government. It is grants from Government. It is generous contributions by private individuals, and we contribute [CARDINAL] on an [DATE] basis. I am also going to tell people that a compassionate policy is one that focuses less on formulas and more on improving people's lives. And so [DATE] I talked about the malaria initiative, for example. There is a great place where the [ORG] countries can come together and help nations on the continent of Africa eradicate malaria. So I am going to [ORG] with an agenda, where we have been the leader. The HIV/ AIDS initiative was a powerful statement of our compassion and our willingness to take the lead on a lot of issues. Another subject which will be in some way at the [ORG] meeting also, [GPE]. [GPE] is contributing a substantial proportion of the amount of troops to the conflict. Your most recent speech continuously made the link between the conflict and 9/11. How do you react towards those who say that connection has been disproved and that growing skepticism in this country and even more in Europe cannot simply be dismissed by your resolve to stay the course, as you say? My point was, about [DATE], is that [GPE] was attacked, and now we are at war in a global war on terror. That is the connection with [DATE]. Some in Europe, I recognize, view [DATE] as a terrible moment. We view it as not only a terrible moment but a clear indication that we are at war with an ideology, people that are willing to use terror to spread their ideology. So my speech, if you look carefully at how it was written-I am confident you did, [PERSON]-shows that I was making the connection between the attack and the global war on terror that we now face- and the ideology of those who attacked us is very similar to those that have now gone into [GPE] to try to stop the progress-and make clear, our strategy is to find the terrorists, bring them to justice before they harm us here, as well as defeat the ideology of hate with an ideology of hope, and that is democracy. Our strategy in [GPE] is to promote a stable democracy, in other words, encourage political progress and, at the same time, train up the [NORP] so they can do the fighting. And I look forward to sharing my thoughts about the progress we are making with your Prime Minister. They have been- [GPE] has been a steadfast ally, and I know he has obviously stood strong in the face of political pressures, made a decision based upon what he thought was right for the world, spreading peace. I strongly believe that we are laying the foundation for peace for [DATE] to come. I reject the notion that certain countries cannot be democratic. I view that elitist-I view that as condemning people to hopelessness. Our policy up to now, prior to [DATE], was, Why do not we just kind of tolerate tyranny and hope for the best. It does not work that way, and we learned a strong lesson. The speech, I think you will see, was that the attack indicated we are at war, and [GPE] is part of that war. Otherwise, why would people be pouring into the country trying to defeat us? Why? Because they fear democracy. They fear the competing ideology that is a hopeful ideology. [INTERVIEWED], a question about your malaria program. Sure. By the time we get back to the office, there will probably be a statement from some group praising your proposal but saying once again, Why did not the President go through [ORG], Tuberculosis, and Malaria? Why do a separate program? Well, first of all, we are supporting [ORG]. But like our AIDS Initiative, we also feel it is an effective way to achieve results. See, you just asked a process question. You are assuming somebody is going to-let us focus on the process. What I want the world to do is focus on how best to get the job done, how best to achieve the objective. And so our strategy has been [CARDINAL]-fold: [CARDINAL], support [ORG]; but on the other hand, target specific countries. And if you noticed, I said in there, this will- we are taking the lead. We want people to follow. We want people in other countries to follow-we want people to follow. And [ORG] is going to take the lead. [ORG] is taking the lead, and I call upon other governments, other foundations, to do the same. So our strategy is one of results, how best to achieve the objective. Give me your name again. [PERSON]. You can call me Mr. [PERSON]. That is fine. Pretty good. Pretty good retort. Very good. [PERSON]. Thank you, sir. Sir, were you surprised when you heard the allegations that the President-elect of [GPE] might have been [CARDINAL] of the people who took [NORP] hostage in [GPE]? And do you have any information that would confirm or refute those charges? I have no information, but obviously, this is-his involvement raises many questions, and knowing how active people are at finding answers to questions, I am confident they will be found. And I spoke to Prime Minister [PERSON] [TIME], spoke to Chancellor [PERSON] [DATE]. I look forward to speaking to [PERSON] when we get to [GPE]. My message is, is that it is very important at this moment for [ORG] send a strong message to the new person there that the world is united in saying that you should not be given the capabilities of enriching uranium, which could then be converted into a nuclear weapon. In other words, we have got a new man who has assumed power, and he must hear a focused message. I was pleased with [PERSON] statement here, and Prime Minister [PERSON] can speak for himself. But let me just say, I believe [ORG] message is going to be a very strong message, and that is where our message is-that is where my attention is focused right now. In order to achieve a diplomatic objective, it is very important to have clear goals. And we have a clear goal, and that is to say to the [NORP]-well, there is a clear understanding that [GPE] should not have a nuclear weapon. It would be a very destabilizing, dangerous situation. And the world is speaking in one voice, and so the message now to the new leader is a very strong message. With regard to trade, [NORP] leaders have been pretty loud in pointing out that subsidies and tariffs are a tremendous handicap to the development of trade. Europe, in particular, has been hostile to really lifting tariffs and subsidies. Any chance of any movement on that, within the context of [ORG]? Well, I appreciate you bringing that up. The African Growth and Opportunity Act, signed by my predecessor and extended by the [ORG] in my administration, is working. I want to remind people that ultimately it is commerce, trade, economic growth that will overwhelm the need for aid itself. And exports from sub-Sahara Africa to [GPE] are up [PERCENT] because we have opened up our markets. The best approach to dealing with Europe-and our own subsidies for that mat-ter-on agricultural matters, is to go to the [GPE] round of the [ORG] and jointly declare that we are going to get rid of all agricultural subsidies. That has been our proposal. The other thing is, it is very important for [NORP] nations themselves to eliminate the barriers of trade intracontinent, between themselves. There are, if you look- at least there was the last time I looked- there were some impediments to trade amongst the [NORP] nations. And so the- we have all got responsibilities to make trade freer. I said in my speech [DATE] that it is -the [ORG] estimated that a successful [GPE] round-in other words, a new trading regime that enabled all countries to trade freely, would lift [CARDINAL] people out of poverty, in their estimate. And that is why this [GPE] round is very important. And so we will spend time articulating how best to continue moving forward on the [GPE] round. That is probably the most-the place where you are going to find that would be most effective in being able to deal with the subsidies, whether it be the [ORG] or our own subsidies for that matter. [FAC] is still a very hot topic for many [NORP]. After [DATE], there are still prisoners there who have not had their case heard. And the [ORG] now are talking about investigating secret [GPE] prisons and detainee facilities. Is that a thing- in the investigation, the [GPE] would cooperate with? And do not you have fears that this is going to harm the [GPE] image a lot if this situation goes on for [DATE]? Well, I think-I think if the truth is not told, it is a problem. But let us talk about the truth, in terms of [FAC]. First of all, there is inspections [TIME] a day, [DATE] a week available for [ORG]. There is been a lot of press contingents down to take a look at the situation firsthand and a lot of congressional folks going down. In other words, a lot of people-there is a transparent situation there. I think we probably had [CARDINAL] or so people detained there, and remember, [PERSON], I made a decision as to what to do with people swept off of a battlefield who did not wear uniforms. I mean, this is a different kind of war. I made the decision they would be treated humanely, just like the Geneva Accords insist, and they have been. Of the [CARDINAL] detained, [CARDINAL] or so have been sent back to their countries. In other words, we screened and analyzed and took a look at whether they would be a threat again. I am in a dilemma-at [CARDINAL] point during this process, because people were let back out on the-sent back to a country, and they ended up killing an [NORP]. What do I tell the loved one? In other words, these people were fighting. They were fighters. They were on the battlefield. Secondly, I agree with you. We need to make sure there is a way forward. And that is why I set up military commissions. But the military-and by the way, in a military commission, people would have lawyers; they would have-there would be procedures, court procedures. Unfortunately- or fortunately, I should not -let me take that back-what has happened has been that our court system is analyzing, making a judicial decision as to whether or not the military-these people should be tried in a military commission or in a civilian court, and we are awaiting a verdict on that. And once that happens, then there will be a way forward. [INTERVIEWED], a question about debt cancellation. Yes. The [ORG] finance ministers came up with a figure of [CARDINAL] countries. Shortly after that, a number of [NORP] Presidents meeting in [GPE] said, It is a good start. We'd like more. Is that [CARDINAL] figure carved in stone, or is there-- Not at all, [PERSON]. There is a-it is a criterion-based agreement, and that other countries will be able to qualify for debt forgiveness as well. So there is a way forward for the other countries that they expressed concerns about. The other thing is, is that I would hope people would take notice of the initiative that I proposed [DATE], and that is [ORG], in its desire to help developing nations, give grants as opposed to loans. And we are making progress toward that goal. [PERSON] did a fine job of making progress toward that goal, and [PERSON] will continue toward that goal. But the idea is that we are relieving the pressure on the balance sheet. But governments have got to make good choices. They have got to be willing to invest and fight corruption, kind of like the criterion in our Millennium Challenge Account, which is a very important initiative. It is one I called on [ORG] to fund. [ORG] has been reluctant to fully fund our request because we have not got the money out the door fast enough. And so my message [DATE] was, like it has been the last couple of times I have talked about Millennium Challenge Account, we will do a better job of processing and moving along. Thank you, sir. [CARDINAL] more round after this, so everybody be preparing your questions. On [GPE], sir, the Deputy Secretary of [ORG] told [ORG] [DATE] or last that [GPE] and Europe should not send troops to [GPE] because they would come up against bloodthirsty, coldblooded killers. Does this mean that the bloodthirsty, cold-blooded killers can set the agenda in [GPE]? And what do you say to some critics who say that your administration is easing off [GPE] because of good counterterrorism intelligence cooperation? That is a preposterous claim. It is not even close to the truth. First, my administration, with [PERSON] and [PERSON] good work, helped solve the north-south civil war. And now we are working close-working with parties to get that peace agreement implemented. Secondly, the strategy, an effective strategy, is to work with the [ORG]-African Union-and use [ORG] forces to help keep the warring parties apart while we continue to press [ORG] as well as rebel groups for a comprehensive settlement. And [GPE] has helped- worked with [ORG] and the [ORG] to provide logistical support for the movement of [CARDINAL] troops into [GPE]. [DATE] I announced it will help build [CARDINAL] additional base camps; it will provide maintenance services, as well as C-130 to help remove [NORP] troops. We spend a lot of time on this important issue. Ours is a nation that called this a genocide. And we take this situation in [GPE] very seriously-and, by the way, lead in terms of aid and working with other nations. [GPE], by the way, has come up with a big tranche of aid [DATE], for which we are grateful. What are you telling or asking [PERSON] now, as [PERSON] intensifies his crackdown against his opposition in [GPE]? As you know, [PERSON] was here. You might remember, I did go to [GPE] as well. And my message has been very consistent: You are a great democracy. You are showing the world what is possible after the terrible period of apartheid. In other words, you showed how to reconcile differences, and you are a very strong nation on the continent of Africa. And next door to you is a person that is destroying a country because of bad policy, and it is not right. And the nations in the neighborhood must be strong. I was asked [DATE], are we willing to tie some of our aid to the position that nations take on [GPE]? I said no because I do not want people to suffer as a result of-more people to suffer as a result of [GPE]. In other words, our aid is focused at people. And on the other hand, working with nations and providing help and aid and trade and, you know, partnering does give us a chance to lend our voice to others who are saying, This has got to change in [GPE]. He is a terrible example. Are you disappointed in [PERSON]? I am disappointed in [PERSON]. He is-[GPE] was a bread basket, provided a lot of food on a continent that often needs food, and it is a country being wrecked. And I am-the world needs to speak very clearly about the decisions he has made and the consequence of the decisions he has made. You have already expressed your admiration for the [NORP] Prime Minister, but I wondered if there were other good reasons behind your decision to take the detour to our tiny country like [GPE] and even ruining part of your birthday by doing that? No, no, it is enhancing it- it is enhancing it. Listen, [GPE] has been a great friend of [GPE] for [DATE]. And I hope my visit sends a statement to the [NORP] people: Thank you for the friendship. I do not expect everybody to agree with the decisions my administration has made-- You know there will be demonstrations in [GPE]? That is fine. Good. That is the great thing about going to a free society, see. [CARDINAL] of the things about-a wonderful thing about freedom is, people are able to express their opinions, and I expect people to express their opinions. On the other hand, I would hope my visit says to the [NORP] people that [GPE] respects you and we share values. And those shared values are important. They are universal values. They are not [NORP] values or [NORP] values. They are universal values, freedom of speech and minority rights, human dignity. So I am looking forward to it. Selfishly, I am looking forward to going to [GPE]. I have never been there, and I cannot wait to see it. Now, admittedly, I am not going to take the typical tourist tour. I do not expect you will find me walking the streets of-you know, in the evening, arm in arm with my wife. On the other hand, I bet I get to see enough of the country to give me a good sense of the beauty of the country. I am really looking forward to it. Do you plan to bring all your family members and your wife? I am bringing wife, for certain, and a family member. All my family members? It is a lot. If you are talking about my daughters, [CARDINAL] of my daughters will be accompanying me. Thank you for asking. [INTERVIEWED], [PERSON], the Governor of [GPE]'s [ORG], questions the whole G-8 process, saying it really should not be focusing on Africa and climate change but rather global prosperity and economic imbalances. And he says that a new mechanism, a new institution is needed that includes [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE]. What do you think about that? You know, the G-8 conferences used to be focused strictly on global-you know, economic-our respective economies, and it is an economic discussion. And it is an interesting growth out of just talking about economics to just understanding that together we can make a difference by helping developing nations grow their economies as well. It is really what you are talking about. The ultimate success on the continent of Africa is going to be whether or not strong economies develop, being able to give people a chance to succeed. And many of the initiatives we are focused on will lay the conditions for economic growth. And you cannot grow if you are at war. That is why I talked about the peacekeeping initiatives. You cannot grow if you have got a huge part of the future of your nation being wiped out because of HIV/AIDS. It is very difficult to grow if you do not educate your women, and that is why I announced a very strong initiative for the education of girls on the continent of Africa. These are projects- it is hard to grow when you have got [CARDINAL] people dying of malaria because of the inability to treat a mosquito bite. I mean, there is something very practical about dealing with-dealing with, on the continent of Africa, the nations, helping nations, partnering nations. And I think it speaks to the admonition that To whom much is given, much is required. And so I find this an important part of an agenda. It should not be the only agenda. We are definitely talking about the environment, definitely talking about Africa. But we will also be talking about the [NORP] conflict. There is a chance for [ORG] nations, developed nations to help the [NORP]. We will be talking about our economies. There is always a nice discussion about currency, for example-an interesting part of the dialog. And I find it interesting to talk with other nations about what they are doing to stimulate their economies. I suspect [ORG]in other words, there will be very-current events will be discussed one way or the other. [GPE], of course, will be discussed. But obviously, [CARDINAL] of the interesting parts of [ORG] that folks will be looking at will be the recent issues within the [ORG]. And my message there will be the same as it was here when [PERSON] and others came, [PERSON] came, and I said, Look, we want Europe to succeed. We want there to be a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace. And we want Europe to be successful in its enterprise, and we want it to be growing. I mean, after all, we have got enormous trade with Europe, and trade is an important part of raising standards of living. If that is the case, you want your trading partner to be healthy. And so we will be discussing-I am confident there will be some discussions about what has taken place. I am looking forward to it. In other words, a broad agenda makes sense to me. But just a quick follow up-- Yes. What about including [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE]? Well, no, [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] will be there. Absolutely. There will be some [NORP] nations there. There will be [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE]-I cannot remember all the nations-but yes, there will be a forum or a discussion including those countries. I am particularly interested in discussing energy with [GPE]. [CARDINAL] of the-we had a problem with [GPE] because [ORG] would have-we did not think the way forward to really achieve an objective we wanted because, first of all, [GPE] would really have hurt our economy a lot. [ORG] did not include countries like [GPE] and [GPE]. And now is the chance to work with developed nations and developing nations to develop a way to share technologies, for example, that will enable us to achieve the objective we want. And [GPE] recognizes there is warming, and that some of that is caused by manmade emissions. But we also recognize that we are dependent upon foreign sources of oil. We want to diversify away from fossil fuels, and we want to help developing nations do the same. And so we have a great opportunity, because of the presence of these nations at this moment to discuss how to go forward. And so, he is right. They should be included, and they are. Final question, [PERSON]. Thank you, sir. Sir, you are coming back stag from Europe-- Coming back? Stag. Your wife is going on to Africa. That is an accurate statement. We understand from [NORP] sources that she is going to [GPE], [GPE], and-- Interesting way to put it. You could have said, You are coming back alone from Europe, or You are coming back sans -- Oooh! But you say, You are coming back stag. If I'd known, I would have gone with the sans. You beat me to it, sir. Communications Director [PERSON]. Where is [PERSON] when you need him? That is right. Classic moment, was not it? Absolutely. Were you there for that? I was not, but I-- We are laughing about the fact that [CARDINAL] of their comrades, a very important person in the [ORG] pool went over to [GPE], [GPE], and fired off a series of questions to [PERSON] in French. My mother e-mailed the corrected French. That is good. I corrected his French too and did not even know what he was saying. This is all off the record, because this will hurt [PERSON]'s feelings. Please. [GPE], you are copiously taking notes. It is going right to him. Good. Communications Director [PERSON]. He just had [CARDINAL]. He had [CARDINAL]? Communications Director [PERSON]. Yes, [DATE]. Fantastic. Gender? Communications Director [PERSON]. A boy and a girl. Weight? Health? Good. Good. Mother? Communications Director [PERSON]. Strong. They are in the [CARDINAL]. I think both of them are [QUANTITY]. That is good, [CARDINAL]. How big were yours? Communications Director [PERSON]. Same, midsize. We are back-where were you? Well, we heard that your wife is going-- I am flying alone, yes. You are flying alone, sans First Lady. She is going to [GPE], [GPE], [GPE]. My question to you is, what message is she bringing from [GPE], and what can she get across that a diplomat or a rock star could not? Her message is: [CARDINAL], [GPE] is committed to Africa, and we have got a good record; secondly, that our commitment to Africa is aimed at helping people. She will be talking about educating young girls, and she will be talking about our HIV/AIDS initiative. Her presence shows commitment. This is the second time she is been to Africa since I have been sworn in as President. Plus, she is a darn good diplomat. She speaks clearly, and she is a- she is a compassionate soul when she speaks, which is-she is a genuinely compassionate person. And people will see her compassion. And there will be no problem with her getting any news coverage, so, in other words, she will be seen, which makes her an effective representative. And part of people knowing that [GPE] cares is for the messenger to have a platform. And so she will have a- she will have the ability to talk from her heart about the specific initiatives that we are very much involved in. All right, listen, thank you all. Looking forward to it. [PERSON], see you over there? Are you going to be there? I leave that to my colleagues. You are going to lateral me. You are going to transfer me off. Well, I am sure they are going to be as professional as you were. I hope so. Nice to see you again. Thank you. Appreciate you.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsrepalexandriaocasiocortezaoccnninterviewontexasabortionbilltranscript", "text": "Infrastructure and the [NORP]' budget resolution from someone who was with the President [DATE]. I am joined now by [GPE] [NORP] [INTERVIEWED1]. [INTERVIEWED1], thanks so much for being with us, appreciate it. I am wondering just from what you saw [DATE], what you heard from the President, were you happy or satisfied with what you heard from President [PERSON] [DATE] in terms of his commitment to battling climate change and providing help to [GPE]? Well, I think in the immediate sense, we have been able to help facilitate in working with President [PERSON] as well as [ORG] in getting [CARDINAL] of the fastest ever disaster assistance approvals from [ORG] so that we could help people on the ground and start helping people recover as quickly as possible. Now, when it comes to climate change, we have to do so much more, and the President's agenda, yes, is important. We must pass the Build Back Better Act, but it is not done until it is on the President's desk, and we also need to make sure that we are continuing to fund these priorities. Right now, reconciliation is really embattled and we have to make sure that we actually bring this legislation home with the Build Back Better Act and making sure that climate is protected, because the fossil fuel industry and the interests of the fossil fuel industry are very much doing their best to try to shape both this legislation and making sure that they are trying to pit it, and frankly, tank it compared to the Infrastructure Act as well. When one talks to experts on climate change and what, in order to respond effectively, what would need to be done, when you actually start to look at the full scope of all the aspects of life that would be impacted and need to be impacted, I mean, the production of how concrete is made, how steel is made, farming procedures, the electrical grid, it is a huge societal shift. Do you think [NORP] are ready for that or been kind of prepared for that? I think we are. I think we absolutely are because the question is not if our entire world and our entire society is going to shift because of climate change, it is a matter of how it is going to shift. So basically, if we do nothing to address climate change, we are going to see the continued destruction of our supply chains. We are going to see our crops not be able to grow in the same way. We will see our infrastructure begin to crumble away. We will see the continuation and proliferation of other future pandemics as well. And so that is how our life could change if we do nothing. It will change dramatically, but it could also change dramatically in a positive direction if we do something. We can create [CARDINAL] of union jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure, shoring up our cities, our rural areas and our suburbs in order to prepare for the climate catastrophes that could come to our shores, but also draw down our carbon output in order to make sure that we prevent future calamities from happening as well. You are obviously from a more progressive wing in [ORG] than President [PERSON], who got elected in part by pledging to work across party lines. And as you clearly know, the bipartisan infrastructure bill seems stall because [NORP] moderates in the [ORG] are balking at the price tag of a separated but related budget resolution that is key to the [ORG] even taking up the infrastructure bill. Is this split among [NORP], what do you make of it? I mean, is it healthy in your view? There certainly seems to be mistrust. Well, I certainly do not think it is healthy that [ORG] lobbyists are bragging about how many senators, [NORP] and [NORP], that they get to have on speed dial and enjoy exclusive access to shaping the contours of this quote, unquote bipartisan infrastructure bill. I do not think that that is healthy at all. I think the role of dark money and the fossil fuel lobby is extremely unhealthy for our democracy. But the fact of the matter is, is that we have got the people on our side, and this is what we continue to say. They have money, these lobbyists and special interests have money, but we have got people. The Build Back Better Act has popular support, and even going above and beyond that, the Green New Deal has popular support even among [NORP] and [NORP]. And so what people I think are united behind is the acknowledgement that climate change is human caused, that the burning of fossil fuels and the continued construction of fossil fuel infrastructure like what we are seeing with [FAC] in [GPE] must be confronted if we are going to create a better future for ourselves. And we can do it while creating [CARDINAL] of union jobs. President [PERSON] was just asked [TIME] about [CARDINAL] of the key moderate, or often referred to as moderate [NORP] opposing the [MONEY] reconciliation package, Senator [PERSON]. I just want to play for our viewers what he had to say. [PERSON] at the end has always been there. He is always been with me. I think we can work something out and I look forward to speaking with him. Do you, I do not know if trust is the right word. Do you trust President [PERSON] to strike a deal with Senator [PERSON] or do you worry about President [PERSON] striking a deal with Senator [PERSON]? I mean, is there a deal that all [NORP] will accept, including [PERSON]? Well, I think one of the interesting aspects of this situation is that it is not just Senator [PERSON] that has leverage. Frankly, the entire party also needs to quote, unquote, worry about that more moderate agenda in the [ORG], because just as we have an extremely slim [ORG] margin, we also have a very slim [ORG] margin. And I, as well as many, many members of the progressive caucus, simply will not vote for Senator [PERSON]'s infrastructure bill unless it is tied together with the Build Back Better Act so that we have an all of the above approach. So we are not saying it is either your bill or our bill, but that both of these bills must move forward together or neither will. And for the [NORP] people, that is the best case scenario, where we are able to address the needs of all communities, instead of just the needs of some communities that are represented by a very small sliver of that bipartisan group. I do not want to put you on the spot, but you mentioned fossil fuel industries. It reminded me of something you had tweeted actually when Senator [PERSON] voiced his opposition in an op-ed [DATE]. You responded via Twitter. On [DATE], you wrote, [PERSON] has [DATE] huddles w/ [ORG] and is [CARDINAL] of many senators who gives lobbyists their pen to write so-called 'bipartisan' fossil fuel bills. It is killing people. Our people. [TIME] 12 last [TIME]. Sick of this 'bipartisan' corruption that masquerades as clear-eyed moderation. Fossil fuel corps & dark money is destroying our democracy, country, & planet. [TIME] our community has been pulling bodies out of homes from the flood. Entire families. And we are supposed to entertain lobbyist talking points about why we should abandoned people & do nothing? No. Are you suggesting that Senator [PERSON] is more interested in pleasing lobbyists than in saving lives from climate change? I think that in [DATE], if any member of [ORG], whether it is a member of the [ORG] or whether it is a member of the [ORG], continues to aid the fossil fuel lobbyists in advancing their agenda over the consensus of science, then they are disconnected from the reality on the ground. And that is simply a fact. What we have been doing over [DATE], first responders in my community, have been pulling out bodies from apartments, basement apartments in [GPE] because of these flash floods. And the idea that we are going to continue building fossil fuel infrastructure, that we are going to continue, even in my backyard, continue to try to build things like peaker plants, natural gas, fracking, pipelines for fracked gas, it is unconscionable. We know that the science is in and it says the construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure will endanger people. It will make these storms worse. We have the capacity to transition to clean and renewable energy and create [CARDINAL] of good union jobs in order to transition to both our infrastructure and our energy system, as well as our power grid. So I do believe that with all of that evidence that we have, with all of the opportunity that we have, economic opportunity that we have, if we continue to listen to the fossil fuel lobby and if we continue to allow them to have this infrastructure, have this influence in [GPE], we are endangering our constituents, and we have to choose the science for once ahead of the lobbyist money. Do you support nuclear? Because there are a lot of people who will look at this issue and say the capabilities of transporting solar and wind power, I mean, our electrical grid needs to completely be altered and upgraded, but even then transporting it long distances and storing it, nuclear is the only answer, at least for in the short term. Yeah. We have even addressed some of this issue, Senator [PERSON] and I, in the drafting of the Green New Deal, which is that I do not think that There is no position in terms of whether we are pro or anti-nuclear. It is about the amount Frankly, it is a logistical question. Can we get an energy mix that is constructed in a [DATE] timeline in accordance with the [ORG] results? And so it certainly does not rule out nuclear, but the issue is, is the construction, the timeline, and making sure that we can also focus on investments, for example, battery storage and energy storage in our power grid so that we are not completely reliant on continual generation, but that we can store energy in times when it is not available. Just lastly, I want to ask you about something that [GPE] Governor [PERSON] just said. He was asked about the [GPE] abortion bill and why force a rape or incest victim survivor to carry a pregnancy to term? This is how he responded. I want to play this for our viewers. Why force a rape or incest victim to carry a pregnancy to term? It does not require that at all because obviously it provides [DATE] for a person to be able to get an abortion. And so, for one, it does not provide that.That said, however, let us make something very clear, rape is a crime and [GPE] will work tirelessly to make sure that we eliminate all rapists from the streets of [GPE] by aggressively going out and arresting them and prosecuting them and getting them off the streets.So goal [CARDINAL] in the state of [GPE] is to eliminate rape so that no woman, no person will be a victim of rape. I am wondering what you thought when you heard that? Well, I find Governor [PERSON]'s comments disgusting, and I think there is twofold. [CARDINAL], I do not know if he is familiar with a menstruating person's body. In fact, I do know that he is not familiar with a female or a menstruating person's body, because if he did, he would know that you do not have [DATE], is that quote, unquote [DATE], and I am sorry we have to break down biology [CARDINAL] on national television, but in case no one has informed him before in his life, [DATE] pregnant means [DATE] late for your period. And [DATE] late on your period for any person, any person with a menstrual cycle can happen if you are stressed, if your diet changes, or for really no reason at all. So you do not have [DATE]. That is first things first. The second area of this, when he talks about going after rapists and this language that he uses about getting rapists off the streets, the majority of people who are raped and who are sexually assaulted are assaulted by someone that they know. And these are not predators that are walking around the streets at [TIME]. They are people's uncles. They are teachers. They are family friends. And when something like that happens, it takes a very long time, first of all, for any victim to come forward. And second of all, when a victim comes forward, they do not necessarily want to bring their case into the carceral system. They do not want to retraumatize themselves by going to court. They do not necessarily all want to report a family friend to a police precinct, let alone in the immediate aftermath of the trauma of a sexual assault. And so while some victims do use that recourse and that is something that is completely available, and if that is part of their process, that is great, but this idea that we are going to quote, unquote end rape when the same type of frankly rape culture and the same type of misogynistic culture that informed this abortion law to begin with is also Those beliefs are held by the Governor himself and [ORG], frankly, there are many people in power, as we know from the MeToo movement, that commits sexual assault, that help their friends cover up these crimes. And some of them even serve in the same state legislatures that are voting on just these anti-choice bills. It is awful. And he speaks from such a place of deep ignorance. And it is not just ignorance. It is ignorance that is hurting people across this country. You said rape culture and misogynistic culture are behind this [GPE] bill to begin with. Could you just explain that, how you feel about that to people? Sure. So when we talk about the law that was passed in [GPE], we know that anti-choice bills are not about being pro-life, because if they were about being pro-life, then [ORG] would support, frankly, an agenda that helps guaranteed healthcare, that helps ensure that people who do give birth that do not have the resources to care for a child can have that care for a child. So we know that none of this is about life. None of this is about supporting life. What this is about is controlling women's bodies and controlling people who are not cisgender men. This is about making sure that someone like me as a woman or any menstruating person in this country cannot make decisions over their own body. And people like Governor [PERSON] and [PERSON] wants to have more control over a woman's body than that woman or that person has over themselves. And that shares with rape culture is that sexual assault is about the abuse of power and sexual assault is about asserting control over another person. And the ease with which these men seek to do that to other people is atrocious. It is morally reprehensible, and they cannot even begin to understand the agonizing decisions that people have to make, including in cases of miscarriage, rape and incest. [INTERVIEWED1], I appreciate your time. Thank you so much. Thank you so very much.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "pelosihousegovnewspressreleasestranscriptofpelosiinterviewonabcsthisweekwithgeorgestephanopoulos4", "text": "Let us bring in the Speaker of the [ORG], [INTERVIEWED]. [INTERVIEWED], thank you for joining us [TIME]. Congratulations on the outcome on [DATE]. I know there is still a lot of votes to be counted and, anyway, we have a lot of news to get to. But before we get to that, I just wanted to ask, how is your husband, [PERSON], doing? Well, thank you for asking and good [TIME]. He is one good day after another, he is improving. It will take a little while. But we have been so comforted by the outpouring of so many prayers and good wishes and even people saying, 'I was not going to vote, but now I am going to vote because this has gone too far.' But thank you so much for asking. I will convey that to him. Please do. You know, we last spoke in [DATE]. You were confident then that the [NORP] would do well, kind of a lonely voice at that time, given high inflation and President [PERSON]'s low approval ratings. How did [NORP] do it? Well, first of all, thank you for acknowledging that we had a different approach. It was not anything that we ever accepted when the pundits in [GPE] said we could not win because history, history, history. Elections are about the future. I am very proud of our candidates, both our incumbents as well as our Red to Blue candidates. They never accepted the punditry that they could not win, they had courage, they had purpose, and they understood their district. They also rejected calls from [GPE] about, 'Oh, your message should change.' No, our message was clear - [ORG], lower costs, bigger paychecks, safer communities. And they knew the value of a woman's right to choose, they knew how important it was to protect our democracy, they knew the contrast between themselves and their opponents, and that is what made them win. It was not about [ORG] said 'you should change your message, ' [ORG] says 'you cannot win.' I hope that is a lesson, because really it depresses the vote sometimes when people say 'it is all over' [DATE] before the election. We never accepted that. Now the road to keeping the [NORP] Majority is still quite narrow. [NORP] have to run the table on the toss-up races still out there to keep control of the [ORG]. Do you see a realistic path to victory? Well, let me just say that is a quite different path than everyone predicted. And I give tribute, of course, to our candidates, I also give credit to our grassroots. This - they are our VIPs, our volunteers in politics, [CARDINAL] of doors knocked, [CARDINAL] of doors knocked. So they crossed a threshold. They leapfrogged over all the projections - the predictions and the rest. Whatever the outcome, we are on the path to taking our country to a better place than with being dragged down by the other side. So we will see. I am disappointed with what happened in [GPE], that [CARDINAL] votes could make the difference at the end of the day. But we have not - we have not given up, and we have not given up because the quality of our candidates, the purpose of our why, why this is important, and President [PERSON] did a great job presenting about our democracy being on the ballot. President [PERSON] making sure people understood it was important for them to vote even though there were those who were saying it is all over at [DATE]. So it took a great deal to get to where we are, and we will just see. I said before, and you have heard me say on our walk in the park, it is like the Olympics. In [TIME], you can be a gold, silver, bronze or honored to be an [NORP]. They would be all very close races. They continue to be. But, again, we are very proud of the outcome, and we are very proud because it was a victory For The People, not the punditry, but For The People, as well as the success in [GPE] is a personal joy for some of us because of [PERSON]. But politically so important for the country. The President, we have [ORG], we have the [ORG], and we are going to have a big strong vote in the [ORG], a very different outcome than some would have predicted. And if [NORP] keep the [ORG], will you run again for Speaker? I am not - right now, I have said I am not making any comments until this election is finished, and we have a little more time to go. I wish it - How about - - would be faster, but it is not . It is going to take some time to count those votes in [GPE], I know. How about on the other side? Your [NORP] counterpart, [PERSON], it looks like even if [NORP] do prevail, we are going to be talking about [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], maybe [CARDINAL] votes in the [ORG]. Can he govern with that kind of a [ORG]? Well, it depends on their purpose. In our [ORG], we had that kind of - those kinds of numbers. But we were united - we were very united in terms of being there for the - [GPE]'s working families, that dominated our discussion - although we have our differences of opinion on certain issues, when it came down to the main purpose of the [NORP], [GPE]'s working families, there was no question that we would win every vote that we would - took to the Floor. And this new - the new Members coming in, again, a constant reinvigoration of the [ORG] that our founders intended. They are so diverse generationally, geographically, opinion, ethnically, gender - gender ID. It is - it is going to be a wonderful class. They will be speaking so clearly to it. We have [CARDINAL] of the youngest Members, Congressman-to-be [PERSON], coming in, and it is - it is pretty exciting for us. So, it is not just about what the ultimate vote is. It is about what the message and purpose will be demonstrated to the [NORP] people. And, again, it is about our democracy. Our democracy was on the ballot. Our planet was on the ballot. Personal freedom was on the ballot. These [CARDINAL] issues very important to young voters, and they were very important in our success in this election. Whatever the outcome, you said [DATE], quote, 'We need to unify, I think it is really important to restore unity to [ORG].' To the country. What is the [NORP]' responsibility there? What steps do [NORP] need to take to bring the country together? Well, we have always been taking that step because we honor our oath to protect and defend the Constitution of [GPE], and that should be a unifying principle for us. The - when, many of our bills, we worked very hard to make it bipartisan, bipartisan, bipartisan. And while the bills were bipartisan, the votes were not. So again, I go back to [PERSON]: 'Public sentiment is everything. With it, you can accomplish almost anything. Without it, practically nothing.' And the point I want to make is, when the public knows what is at stake and what is happening there, I think we will see more cooperation, again, working together to produce a bill, but not having people vote no, take the dough, and make it look like we do not have bipartisanship, when, in fact, in the bills we do, but in the votes, not necessarily. Let the public know. Before the new [ORG] is sworn in in [DATE], you have a lot of work in what would be a lame duck session in [DATE]. Probably at the top of that list, extending the debt limit because [NORP] have said, if they get the [ORG], they are going to try to force concessions from [NORP] in order to extend the debt limit. Do you believe you can get a permanent or a very large extension of the debt limit during the lame duck session? Well, I think it would be very important for us to do so. I think it is important to note that what the [NORP] have said is they are going to use the vote on the debt limit as leverage to cut [ORG] and [ORG]. I think the public should know that. It is a difference of opinion, and I think the public should know who is on their side on all of this. We cannot allow them to cut [ORG]. It is an insurance program, as is [ORG]. People paid into it, and the [NORP] cannot use it as leverage to say, 'We will only lift the debt ceiling if you will reduce the benefits for our seniors and others on [ORG] and [ORG].' So, we will see what they contend that they want to do. But our best shot I think is to do it - to do it now. But again, winning the [ORG] gave us a lot of leverage for how we go forward if we do not do it in the lame duck. But my hope would be that we could get it done in the lame duck. The Constitution removes all doubt. The full faith and credit of [GPE] should not - is not in doubt. But this is a practice that we have engaged in. And so, we will have to, again, lift the debt ceiling so the full faith and credit of [GPE] is respected. There is great risk to even discussing not doing it. When the [NORP] did this before, it lowered our credit rating. It lowered our credit rating - even though it did not eventually happen, but just the discussion of it. So this is - this is dealing with fire when we are talking about the stability of our credit rating. In the face of all this news, we see that [PERSON] is planning to announce for President again on [DATE]. Is that good news for [NORP]? I do not go into any discussion of his plans. I mean, I think it is bad news for the country, let us put it that way, because this is a person who has undermined the integrity of our elections, has not honored his oath of office, who has encouraged people, strange kind of people to run for office, who do not share the values of our democracy. They have said it very clearly in their statements. So he is not been a force for good. So, I do not think his candidacy is a force for good for our country. But that is up to the [NORP] to decide - to decide who they will choose. Understand this, we have very vast differences. [NORP] do not support science, so they disregard what we are saying about climate. They do not support governance, so they do not want to honor what science tells us in terms of the planet, in terms of health care and the rest. So, we have some very big differences. There is - the main event of it all is the Presidential. As important as our races are, if we were in [GPE], we are the lounge act, they are - the Presidential is the main event, and this will be a very important election, very dispositive of the direction our country will go in. So - so do you think President [PERSON] should run again? Yes, I do. I mean President [PERSON] has been a great President for our country. He has accomplished so much. [CARDINAL] job - [CARDINAL] jobs under his leadership. Working with the private sector, of course. He has just done so many things that are so great. We need a lot more show to tell it. But he is put money in people's pockets, vaccines in their arms, children back to school, people back to work, for starters, creating [CARDINAL] jobs. He has made [GPE] independent by passing the CHIPS bill that says we are no longer reliant on those who would withhold products that enable us to manufacture in our country. The IRA - I just saw him make the speech in [GPE] where he spoke about [GPE]'s commitment to preserving the planet with the legislation, the IRA, [MONEY] in good-paying green jobs, clean air, clean water for our children, national security issue to stop migrations and competition for habitat and food, as well as honoring our responsibility to future generations. The PACT Act, honoring our veterans, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, all of it with justice, with equity, with inclusiveness, with diversity, taking us to a new place. Finally - He has been a great President, and he has a great record to run on. Finally, [INTERVIEWED], if you do decide to step away from [ORG], how do you want your Speakerships to be remembered? Well, I do not have any plans to step away from [ORG]. I do not - you asked me about running for Leadership. No, I mean, these votes are very close, though. The - well, my flagship issue has - from the start of my being in [ORG] has been the climate issue. But in the course of things we - when we had the opportunity to expand health care for all [NORP], that has to be my major accomplishment. I take great pride in that. Great pride in passing it under the leadership of President [PERSON] and working with [PERSON] in the [ORG]. I take great pride in saving it from those who wanted to repeal it. For what reason? I do not know. You'd have to ask them. To remove [CARDINAL] of people from having access to health care. That - [PERSON] said, 'Of all the inequalities, the inequity in access to health care is the most inhuman, ' he said, 'because people can die.' So I thank God for giving me the opportunity to play a role in that. And it is an ongoing role to pass it, to protect it, to expand it. So that would be my - [INTERVIEWED] - But I take pride in so much else. But I do not take credit for it. My Members, the courage of the Members, the [ORG] [NORP], to vote for this - it is easy for me coming from the beautiful place that I do, [GPE], harder for others. And it is their courage that made so much of this possible. So, I am so glad that we had a great - we increased - just dispelled the notion that [NORP] could not win. We are coming close. But we are on a path to a brighter future for [GPE]. And I am very proud of our Members, our candidates, their courage and their purpose and their success. [INTERVIEWED], thank you for your time [TIME]. My pleasure. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithbrianwilliamsnbcnightlynews", "text": "Just a block from here, you may not have known it, you drove by houses with holes still in the roof, where there'd been live rescues. There is still [ORG] markings in spray paint. And yet, [GPE] is like this. This is a symbol of recovery. Katrina was about so many things. It was about class and race and government and - and the environment. What ever happened to that national conversation we were supposed to have about it? Well, I think that we are still having it. I - I do not think that conversation happens in - [CARDINAL] instance. I think that there is a constant evolving debate about what are our obligations to each other. How do we make sure that in moments of devastation that we are looking out for one another? How does government organize itself, both at the federal level interacting with state and local officials? How do we make sure that folks who were already vulnerable before a catastrophe hits are not made worse off as a consequence of it? And, you know, what you have seen I think in [GPE] is steady progress. But, you know, we have still got a long way to go. And part of the reason that I wanted to come down here [DATE] to mark the fifth anniversary, was just to send a message to the people of [GPE], but also the entire Gulf Coast, that they have , you know, gotten hit pretty good over [DATE]. And all of [GPE], not just people here, not just folks in [ORG], but all of [GPE], remains concerned and remains committed to their rebuilding. Do you still get driven to anger over it when you see those pictures again after [DATE]? Oh, absolutely. The - the children, the old folks, the people suffering in this city? Oh, well, you know, I still remember - I was in a [GPE] hotel room. I had just come back with [NORP] Senator [PERSON] on a fact finding trip on nuclear issues. And we had gotten in - into [GPE], we were at the hotel, and we suddenly we just saw this thing unfold. In ways that were searing to anybody with a conscience. And, you know, frankly, were a shock, I think, to many of us who did not think that something like that could happen in [GPE]. And you know, I meant - I meant - I referred [DATE] in my speech, immediately afterwards I flew back, went down to [GPE] with President [PERSON] and the first President [PERSON]. And talked to folks who were - at that point - and I do not think even at that time we realized the full scope of the - of the disaster. But what - what it did do, though, was reawaken, I hope, a sense that we are all in this thing together. That, you know, we may be divided along political lines. We may have arguments, ideologically, about the best way to approach this or that problem. But when you have got something like a Katrina happen. When you have got major disasters. When you see people who are doing their best, but have just been overwhelmed that we have got to put all that stuff aside. And come in and make sure that we get the job done. The folks here still want a lot from you. I have been talking to them for [DATE]. What would they ask you? They want you to come spend [TIME]. They want you to treat their wetlands like an emergency, like the [ORG] or the Marshall Plan, because as they always say, they are losing a football field an hour. Right. Perversely, could [ORG] money pay for the - the reengineering and the preservation of the wetlands potentially? Well, I think what everybody's understood is that we can build the best levees in the world. And we - we are going to be be on schedule for [DATE] having gotten - all the levees strengthened, so that they can withstand a [DATE] surge. You are confident? Well, I - we are on schedule right now. And I am going to be keep on making sure that we stay on schedule. We have already fortified [QUANTITY] of levees. But the - the real protection for [GPE] and for the Gulf are the wetlands. And that is an environmental disaster that had been occurring long before Katrina. And I think in light of what is happened with the oil spill, this is an opportunity for us to take a look comprehensively all along the coast and say, How do we do things better? How do we do things smarter than we have done before? I assigned Secretary of the [ORG], [PERSON], who is a son of the Gulf. Former mayor, former governor of [GPE]. He is been traveling and listening and talking to folks all across this region. He will be working with our [ORG] director. All of our various agencies that are involved. To find out ways that we can leverage as much as possible the money that is going to be but needed for short term repair to make sure that we are doing things smarter over the long term. This was, of course, [GPE] Katrina and [GPE]'s Katrina. And you are familiar now that it is getting baked in a little bit in the media that [ORG] was [INTERVIEWER1]'s Katrina. And it is also getting baked in that the [ORG] was slow off the mark. Is that unfair? Well, I - it is just not accurate. If you take a look at our response the only thing in common we had with - the Katrina response was [PERSON], who came in and helped to organize rescue efforts - and he did so under Katrina, he did so for us. But if you look, we had immediately [CARDINAL] of vessels, [CARDINAL] of people who are here. And what we are seeing now is that we have got a lot more work to do. But the fact is because of the sturdiness and swiftness of the response, there is a lot less oil hitting these shores and these beaches than anybody would have anticipated, given the volume that was coming out of - the - the [ORG] - oil - oil well. You believe it is still out there, though? Oh, absolutely. It - there is no doubt, but what we have seen is - is that the skimming, the burning, all the efforts that took place in coordination with local folks here, who often times new the landscape and new the waters better than any federal official did. As a consequence of that not only have we been able to stop the well. But we have actually seen less damage than might have occurred had we not had that kind of a response. Now, the key is to make sure that we are monitoring it carefully, based on sound science. And that it is a sustained effort over time. That is something that I am committed to. Let us talk about another topic that is part of the firmament here and everywhere. And that is the economy. [ORG] said [DATE], [INTERVIEWER1]has another new plan on the economy. Now would be a good time to find out about it. Do you have anything new on the economy? And while you have been away, we had a horrible GDP number [DATE]. Well, look, we - we anticipated that the recovery was slowing. The economy is still growing, but it is not growing as fast as it needs to. I have got things right now in - before [ORG] that we should move immediately. And I have said so before I went on vacation, and I will keep on saying when I - now that I am back. We should be passing legislation that helps small businesses get credit, that eliminates capital gains taxes so that they have more incentive to invest right now. There are a whole host of measures we could take, no single element of which is a magic bullet but cumulatively can start continuing to build momentum for the recovery. But look, the - this was the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and the worst recession since the Great Depression. And so, what we know is that we are going to have to slowly, steadily build confidence. Push more investment out there. Target areas like clean energy that we know are going to be be growth areas in the future. Look at how we are doing our infrastructure, so that we can maximize the amount of jobs that are created. So, there - there are a range of steps that I hope we can get bipartisan support for. But right now, we are still - we are in [DATE], political season, which means that for [DATE] there is going to be be constantly a contest in the minds of Members of [ORG]. And my [NORP] friends in [ORG], between doing what the country needs and what they think may be advantageous in the - in terms of short term politics. Since you weighed into the Islamic Center near [FAC] controversy, it - it is gotten larger. It is been nationalized, the debate. Will you revisit that topic? Well, look, I think my statement at the [ORG] dinner in [FAC] was very clear. And that is - is that if you can build a church on that site. If you can build a synagogue on that site or [FAC] on that site, then we cannot treat people of the [NORP] faith differently, who are [NORP], who are [NORP] citizens. That is central to who we are. That is a core value of our Constitution. And my job as President is to make sure in part that we are upholding our Constitution. Respectfully, [DATE] in [GPE], you seemed to walk that back. So - No, I - actually, let - let me be clear, [PERSON]. I did not walk it back at all. The - what I said was I was not endorsing any particular project. I was endorsing our Constitution. And what is right. Now, the media, I think - anticipating that this was going to be be a firestorm politically - seemed to think that somehow there was inconsistency and there was not . And I was very specific to my team and will be very specific to you now. That the core value and principle that every [NORP] is treated the same. That does not change. I mean, think about it - I - at this [ORG] dinner I had - [NORP] who had been in uniform fighting in [GPE]. Some of whom have served [DATE]. How - how can you say to them that somehow their religious faith is less worthy of respect under our Constitution and our system of government? You know, that is - that is something that I feel very strongly about. I respect the feelings on the other side. And I would defend their right to express them just as fiercely. [INTERVIEWED1], you are an [NORP] born [NORP]. Uh-huh. And yet, increasing and now significant numbers of [NORP] in polls, [CARDINAL] of respondents are claiming you are neither. [CARDINAL] of the people, just about, believe you are a [NORP]. Keep in mind, those [CARDINAL] things - [NORP] born and [NORP] - are not the same. So - but I understand your point. Either or the latter, and the most recent number is the latter. This has to be troubling to you. This is, of course, all new territory for an [NORP] President. Well, look, the - the facts are the facts, right? So, we went through some of this during the campaign. You know, there is a mechanism, a network of misinformation, that in a new media era can get churned out there constantly. We dealt with this when I was first running for [ORG]. We dealt with it when we were first running for the Presidency. There were those who said I could not win as [GPE] Senator because I had a funny name. And people would be too unfamiliar with it. And yet, we ended up winning that [ORG] seat in [GPE] because I trusted in the [NORP] people's capacity to get beyond all this nonsense and focus on is this somebody who cares about me and cares about my family and has a vision for the future? And so, I will always put my money on the [NORP] people. And I am not going to be worrying too much about whatever rumors are floating on - out there. If I spend all my time chasing after that then I would not get much done. Even a number as sizeable as this - what does it say to you? Does it say anything about your communications or the effectiveness of your opponents to - Well, look, [PERSON], I - I would say that I cannot spend all my time with my birth certificate plastered on my forehead. [laughs] It - it is what - the facts are the facts. And so, it is not something that I can I think spend all my time worrying about. And I do not think the [NORP] people want me to spend all my time worrying about it. What does it say to you that [PERSON] was able to draw a crowd of perhaps [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] people on the anniversary of Dr. [PERSON]'s speech, on the site of Dr. [PERSON]'s speech? Message appeared to be, at times, anti-government, anti-spread of government. Anti-Obama administration. And in favor of - I guess - re-injecting God into both politics and the [NORP] discourse. Well, I have to say, I - I did not watch the rally. I think that one of the wonderful things about this country is that at any given moment any group of people can decide, you know, We want to - our voices heard. And - and so, I think that Mr. [PERSON] and the rest of those folks were exercising their rights under our Constitution exactly as they should. I - I do think that it is important for us to recognize that right now, the country's going through a very difficult time, as a consequence of [DATE] of neglect in a whole range of areas. Our schools not working the way they need to, so we have slipped in terms of the number of college graduates, you know? A financial system that was not, you know, operating in a way that maintained integrity and assured that the people who were investing or who were buying a home or were using a credit card were not getting in some way cheated. We had a health care system that was broken and that was bankrupting families and businesses. All those issues are big, tough, difficult issues. And those are just our domestic issues. That is before we get to policy issues in [CARDINAL] wars. And a continuing battle against terrorists who want to do us harm. So, given all those anxieties - and given the fact that, you know, in none of these situations are you going to be fix things [TIME]. It is not surprising that somebody like a Mr. [PERSON] is able to stir up a certain portion of the country. That is been true throughout our history. What I am focused on is making sure that the decisions we are making now are going to be be not good for the [TIME] news. Not good even necessarily for the next election. But are good for the next generation. And I am very confident that those decisions are the ones that we have made. As you note it ties into an economy in down times. Do you have a message for the disenchanted? The angry? The angry who are unemployed and feeling victimized by this economy? Well, look, I think they have every right to be frustrated. And they have every right to be angry. And I think the message that I will continue to deliver in [DATE] and [DATE] is it took us a long time to get into this hole that we are in. This was the worst economic crisis that we have seen in [DATE]. And we are making progress. We are steadily moving forward. [DATE], we were still losing jobs, we are now gaining them. The economy was still contracting, it is not expanding. It is not happening as fast as people would like. But it is moving in the right direction. And the thing we cannot do is to try to go back to the same policies that created this mess in the first place. Now, part of the - I think the balance that we are going to be have to strike is the fact that, you know, we have got huge debt, huge deficits that amounted as a consequence of this financial crisis. A consequence of this incredibly deep recession. And that means that we are going to be have to do [CARDINAL] things at once. We have got to keep on pushing to grow the economy. But we have also on the medium term and the long term have to get control of our deficit. And it would be ideal where we did not have to worry about [CARDINAL] and could just focus on the other. But, you know, this generation, it is fallen on our shoulders to make some very tough decisions. The [CARDINAL] thing I guess I would say to the [NORP] people is that we have been through tougher times before. And we always come out ahead. As long as we stay united. As long as we stay optimistic about the future. As long as we stay innovative. As long as we work hard and we apply ourselves. We have still got the best universities, the best workers, the best business climate of any economy in the world. And so, I have no doubt that we are going to be rebound and rebound strong. But when you are in the middle of it. And if you do not have a job right now. It is - it is a tough, tough situation. Finally, sir, because I see fidgeting - on [GPE]. You are speaking on that subject [DATE]. We watched the last of the combat troops leave live on on television. Our own [PERSON] wrote along with them. The end of Operation Iraqi Freedom. What would it take to send combat troops back in? A real and present threat to [CARDINAL] or so that remain in the so-called noncombat role would General [PERSON] have to call you and say, We need more firepower back here. There were what? [CARDINAL] coordinated bombings on [DATE]. You know, [PERSON], I am not going to be speculate on what scenarios might occur. Here is what I know. The trend lines have been steadily declining violence. Even after we left the cities. What you have seen is lower and lower levels of violence. [ORG] are functioning at least as well if not better than any of us had anticipated. And there is great confidence on the part of the commanders on the ground. That even though you are going to be see some efforts at any given time for remnants of A.Q.I. and terrorist organizations to try to stir things up. That in fact you are not going to be see the kind of sectarian war break out in [GPE] that had occurred. That does not mean that it is going to be be smooth sailing from here on out. That is why we have still got a training operation there. That is why we are going to be continue to conduct joint counterterrorism operations. That is why we have got to make sure that we have the troops there to protect our civilians who are really taking over the lead there. But the bottom line is - is that we have been able to successfully transition and turn over sovereignty and security operations to the [NORP]. Their job right now is to make sure that they get a government completed. And they are going through a political process that is natural in a fledgling democracy. But we are confident that that will get done. And that we are going to be be a long term partner within [GPE]. But we are not going to be be operating in the same combat role that we have in the past. And finally, I am hoping to find you in a reflective mood on [DATE]. We are the first to speak to you coming off your [DATE] vacation. How does it recharge you? What do you think about? What do you see? What do you read about? How are you thinking about your job [DATE]? You know, we went through [DATE] of as intense a set of problems as I think any President's faced in a very long time. And I can look back and say we got some really tough stuff done that needed to get done. And as I look forward, my central focus is going to be be to make sure that I am constantly communicating with all segments of this country about why I feel optimistic about our future. You know, one of the - one of the actual great things about [GPE] as I was doing some - some - historical reading, during the break is we kind of go through these periods during difficult times where we think we are falling behind. You know, nothing's going right. We do a lot of soul searching. And then usually we come out of that funk and it is precisely because we do some self reflection. And we ask tough questions. And we have these contentious debates. And there is - you know - a lot of folks who have very strong opinions about various issues. That process helps guide us in a better direction. That is part of the reason why this is a more dynamic society than others. This is one that is adaptable. That can change. That can recover. That is resilient. And, you know, the [CARDINAL] thing that I have never felt more confident about is that [GPE] will continue to lead the world, will continue to be resilient. And we are going to be just have to make sure that we stay steady and do not lose heart as we transition into a better future. And that means we are going to be have to make some tough choices now. But you know, we should - you know, we should constantly have our eye on - on that longer term price. What are you thinking about your jobs [DATE]? Well, you know, I think that [DATE] were, as I have said, about getting some very hard things done and contentious things done, but that needed to be done. I think [DATE], we have got to focus on debt and deficits. We have got to focus on making sure that we make the recovery stronger. And a lot of that is attracting private investment. Making sure that these companies who are making good profits are actually seeing the opportunities out there in a whole range of new areas and new ventures. So, there was a lot more implementation, management - probably less of the constant legislative functions that we had. But I - I am confident that both things are necessary. Both things are important. Enough work remaining to seek a second term out of. Well, you know, the - I - I am not spending a lot of time thinking about a second term. Right now, I am spending a lot of time thinking about what I got to do [DATE].", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "pelosihousegovnewspressreleasestranscriptofpelosiinterviewonmsnbcslivewithstephanieruhle", "text": "Right now, I'd like to bring in the Speaker of the [ORG], [INTERVIEWED1]. [INTERVIEWED1], thank you so much for joining us and, I want to say thank you. You set aside [MONEY] in emergency loans for small businesses. People across this country need it. But, already [DATE], the head of [ORG] said that we would need [MONEY] to meet small business demand. Is this [MONEY] going to be enough? Well, this is [MONEY] on top of the [MONEY]billion] that we had done [DATE] before. I think it is all in the execution. As the Secretary of the [ORG] says, let us see how this works and where our needs are. But first, let me just say, watching your report and the rest, how much we pray for everyone in our country, those who have lost their lives. When businesses are opening, I think that is unfortunate because we are not protecting the investment that we have made, but that is a choice. And I pray for those people, too, that they do not get sick. So this is always very, very sad. And we have the lives at stake and we have the livelihoods at stake. And, in terms of livelihood, we are all big believers in small business: the entrepreneurship of [GPE], the optimism of it all, the courage to start a small business. And we really need to help them. So, we are all committed to that. We were very pleased in our last bill that we expanded that opportunity. The so-called underbanked, those who would have less possibility of being first in line with some of the banks. And so, in any event, let us see how this goes. The other - it is all going to be happening very soon. We will see how long it lasts. But, we have to do other things. It is about jobs, jobs, jobs. And the issue is that we have to have state and local. We have to protect our heroes: the health care workers, the first responders, police, fire, emergency services, people transportation, food, the postal service and the rest. Those are jobs, too, and when you open up your business, you want to have customers. You can have the rent paid and employees paid and electricity - the utility bill paid, but you still have to have customers. So, we want to, again, make sure that these people who are risking their lives to save other people's lives are not risking their jobs as well because the state and localities cannot pay them. It is not about bureaucracy. It is about delivery of service to the [NORP] people. So, we want to have a vitality throughout our economy. And then we will see what the needs are. We may have to think in terms of some different ways to put money in people's pockets. But we know that the needs are massive in terms of economically. From a health perspective, we are preparing people to live without a vaccine for [DATE], but from an economic perspective, look at PPP. Even with all this money, we are only creating solutions for [DATE]. [DATE], when the majority of these businesses do not open back up, then what? Well, I think we should extend the time. I really do. I always thought that was too short a time. I think we should extend the time. I think what you suggest makes all the sense in the world. And then, again, as we go forward, let us see what works: what is operational and what needs other attention. Others have suggested a minimum income for - a guaranteed income for people. Is that worthy of attention now? Perhaps so, because there are many more people than just in small business and hired by small business, as important as that is to the vitality of our economy. And other people who are not in the public sector, you know, meeting our needs in so many ways, that may need some assistance as well. But we are talking about the lives of the [NORP] people. And, again, the pull and push of should we open up or not, if it jeopardizes the lives of the [NORP] people, we have to handle it with care. But, again, recognize the realities of it all. What is the execution of it? What is working? And what is - what are we getting our money's worth on? I think we have to look at that, too. How is the money being spent? With all the best intentions in the world, but nonetheless, we want the money to go where it needs. If I just may, [INTERVIEWER1], say this: there are [CARDINAL] things that I hear from the [NORP] people, from - by way of my constituents, but also the constituents of [CARDINAL] of Members of [ORG]. They want our first responders, our heroes, to be protected. They know they are risking their lives to save other lives and, now, they are risking their jobs, as I mentioned. Secondly, they want their check. They want their direct payment check, their unemployment check or they want their small business - their PPP check. They want their check. And, third, they do not want any of this [MONEY] that we are injecting into the economy, that some of which goes to major corporations, any of that money to be use for anything other than keeping people in their jobs. They do not want any buybacks, corporate whatever, dividends, bonuses, CEO pay, the rest of that. That really angers the [NORP] people. It is sort of a hangover from the Great Recession. So, it is important that we have oversight to see exactly how all of this is spent. Not in a pointing a blame - point the fingers, but just to make sure everybody knows that there will be transparency and there will be accountability. I agree with you wholeheartedly, but then I have to impress upon you, it is the government's responsibility to do that. As it relates to [ORG], it is the media who has outed all of these companies who took the money. It was the media who talked about hedge funds and private equity firms and law firms taking the money. The government sets the rules, ma'am. Yes indeed. And we passed the law, but the Executive branch puts forth the advisories and the regulation. So, when I suggested to the Secretary of the [ORG] some of the concerns we have about what you have just described, he said, 'Well, I am the one who put out the list. They would not have known that had I not put out the list.' So, I guess that was his way of saying, 'Let us all take a look at this as we go forth.' But we really - I mean, these dollars are precious dollars. They make a world of difference, life and death to the survival of a company, for some companies, and others really do not need it that much. And we have to take a look at how banks are compensated. They get a higher percentage for a small loan. But if you get [PERCENT] on a [MONEY] loan, that is a lot less than getting [PERCENT] on a [MONEY] loan, and again, is that right? Should not it just be a flat fee? And others - just to subject everything to the scrutiny that needs to be done for the taxpayer dollars and how they are spent. That is what our job is all the time. But at this time, where there is such need and such desperation, even more so. So, again, we will have to keep examining. I think we have to do what we need to do. Others are talking about the deficit - 'Oh, the national debt.' Well, they never talked about the national debt when they spent [MONEY] for a tax bill to get [PERCENT] of the benefits to [PERCENT] in our country. And I am a - I am pay as you go. I do not like building the national debt, but a lot of what we are doing is stimulus. Unemployment Insurance is stimulus. Food stamps are stimulus, even though we cannot get them to agree with us on that. Then let us break down all of these issues because the idea [DATE] that angered so many people was that bigger companies with other access to capital were using PPP. But the idea of PPP is [ORG], and if you no longer want some of these larger businesses in there, what are you going to do, A, to help them? And, B, you know they are going to lay off [CARDINAL] and thousands of workers, especially restaurant chains. So, should there be a solution for them? Well, look, I come from a city of [GPE]. Hospitality - we have a diversity in our economy in [GPE], hospitality being a very important part of it. But it is important in many places throughout the country, actually throughout the whole country as I am finding out. And we really do have to address that, as if they are not being able to get the same kind of small business loan, perhaps in some cases, again, as you said, we have to extend the time. But in some cases, we have to also perhaps expand it to [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] people rather than [CARDINAL]. That would help some non-profits, which we hope would be able to participate in all of this. But they are larger in number and lower in pay that they pay people. There is some limitations on what can be done in that regard. I have spoken to the Chairman of the [ORG] about that and, of course, to the Secretary of the [ORG]. So, let us just put it all down there, subject it to the harshest scrutiny: where are these dollars are going and what is it in there that is, in a sense of decency, that the banks and the bigger businesses who really do not need it have deeper pockets, a longer survival capacity than some of the small businesses which will be gone, as you said, [DATE] [DATE]. Many of them will disappear, never to return from what they are telling me. So again, we all join together for [ORG]. We believe in that, but, again, we want to make sure it works. Without a doubt. If we scrutinize it after the fact when time is so essential, we could lose businesses, and right now we are arguing over which businesses need it most. With the exception of just very few businesses, most industries across the country are in desperate need. Do we have to start to focus and say, does the federal government need to just take over payroll, create mortgage deferment or just say we need to create a national economic holiday until it is safe? Because right now, we are bickering over who is suffering more. I do not think it is bickering. I think it is a legitimate discussion of, again, when we passed - I saw you had the leader of their [ORG] debate on our bill we passed [DATE], on there saying, 'We could have done this [DATE].' No, we could not have. They could have agreed to the additional - they had [MONEY]]. We brought it up to [MONEY]]. And when we brought it up to [MONEY]], it had [MONEY] for hospitals and testing in there, which is essential to our opening up. Testing, testing, testing. But we also had [MONEY] for smaller businesses, which are getting left in the shade, and that just was not right. So, it is not a question of bickering. It is about establishing priorities, and we have a differences between our parties. The gentleman that you interviewed, Mr. [PERSON], he said on the Floor of the [ORG], 'We could have done this [DATE], except they had extracurricular stuff.' Extracurricular stuff? [MONEY] for hospitals and testing. [MONEY] for small businesses, more in terms of the EIDL loans, which are flying out the door because they are easier to get for businesses. They have a longer - a long-term and a low interest rate, so they are very appealing. And the grants and aid that never do have to be paid back, in addition to [MONEY] more for PPP. So, we have to be smart about this. They could have agreed. What they rejected [DATE], they passed unanimously in the [ORG] and overwhelmingly, in a bipartisan way, in the [ORG]. Every bill we have passed has been bipartisan, but we have had to make the case about lower-income, smaller businesses, again, women, minority - we do not want to put any - prioritize anybody over anybody else because it is about jobs. You know it is about jobs. No matter where you work, it is about jobs. So, if that business needs the infusion to keep people on the job, then that is what this is about. But it also has to not ossify any disparity of access to credit in our country, which does exist. So, we want everybody to enjoy the vitality of it all. And every single dollar passed is desperately needed, but I do want to ask: you had said on [DATE] that you were disappointed that the banks did not act as better stewards. My question is twofold. Banks are going to protect themselves because that is what they have to do, and they asked the government to release them of some of their risk review requirements because, if what the banks did was give loans very quickly to borrowers who they did not know, if those were not good loans, those banks could be on the hook [DATE]. If the government wanted it done differently, why would not the government do it itself? The [ORG], they know how to collect our money. They could give the money out. Well, it was a decision that Secretary of the [ORG] made to go through the banks for facilitation, that perhaps it would be faster to do than to go through a SBA - a [ORG] process. In my - I do not want banks to be made villains in this. They are facilitators, and this should be something we go forward with in a very positive way. It is interesting, though, that they make a lot of money off of it and, therefore, it could affect their behavior in all of it. But what I had said is, with the fact the [ORG] has kissed this loan, there is no risk. There is no risk. And as well as the [ORG] enabling them to not have this count. Pardon me, but there is. I am sorry? If I may, the reason for the delay, if I may, the reason for the delay, the banks need to do a risk review process. After they do that, they then go to the [ORG]. [CARDINAL] of the main reasons for the hold-up, banks did not have to do a very long risk review for clients that they already knew. That is one of the reasons it went so quickly. For new borrowers, it took some more time. So they are on the hook before they go to the [ORG]. These banks lived through this in [DATE]. They did not make good decisions and they paid for it after. If they did that again, they'd get annihilated. Well, I would say that in [DATE], they were part of the problem. I do not see that this time. But let me say that that is why it was hard to understand why our [NORP] colleagues were not embracing our initiative of [MONEY] that would go to community development financial institutions. So those institutions who know the neighborhood, who know the community, know the customers, know the businesses, know the culture would be able to make loans, smaller loans, into the community. And take - alleviate some of that from the banks. I thought it was really something that they would welcome because, therefore, those who know that community better would be meeting their needs. Without a doubt. So, that is why I am so pleased we got - Me too. Will that [MONEY], will they get to go first when the portal opens up again? Will they get to go before the big banks to make sure the money goes to the small borrowers? Well, this is - it is like [CARDINAL] different funds. And the Secretary has been very - working very hard in my view, when I talked to him about it, he said, 'We are working it, we are working it.' So that these portals, or whatever, are for that community. So, it is not a question of going fast. The [MONEY]billion] is already going to the PPP. This is additional and specific to that community. But also, [MONEY] in EIDL loans, the Emergency Injury [Disaster] Loans, and that is [MONEY] leveraged to [MONEY] in loans. And that is a very popular program. No matter how big you are or how small you are, people like the long-term, low interest and the immediacy of getting that. So, that was a very important part of this as well. And that is an [ORG] loan, so that goes fast. And then we have the grants that every small business can apply for. But you have said it very clearly. Whether it is the restaurants, the hospitality industry, there is some that just are not a fit and we have to see why. Is it number of employees? Is it length of time? Is it in terms of non-profits, the 501, , ? Let us see how we can expand this. Because we could actually, with the combination of all of these things, be reaching maybe [PERCENT] of all the small businesses in [GPE]. And that would be a wonderful thing because, again, the entrepreneurship, the vitality, the courage, the optimism to start a small business. And then people have them for a number of years and then you see their hopes just fade because of something so beyond their control. So, make no mistake, this is central. That is why we made it the centerpiece of the first - of the first distribution of funds into the business community. We also had a big program for those aerospace industry, airline industry, which, again, in order to keep people on the job, they received - the Secretary has the discretion to spend a great deal of money there, but we do not want to see any of that money squandered on anything other than job retention because that is what the point of all of this is. And that is how people are going to be able to spend in the economy, have consumer confidence, be able to meet the needs of their families, as we deal with the suffering that is going with this. The lives, the livelihood - economic livelihood, so important - as well as the life of our democracy. So, in this next bill, we will be supporting vote by mail in a very important way. We think it is a health issue, at this point. And I did not want to leave this conversation without mentioning the importance of the life, the livelihood - the life of our people, the livelihood of themselves and our economy and the life of our democracy. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you for [MONEY]. [NORP] business needs it. I appreciate all that everyone in our government is doing right now to help us in this trying time. Thanks for your time [TIME]. Well, thank you for your objective view of it all because that is all very helpful. It is all very helpful. Thank you so much for your attention to this important issue. Thank you. Thanks. Have [TIME].", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithforeignprintjournalists4", "text": "Thanks. Looking forward is [GPE], [GPE], and then [GPE]. to my trip. As you all know, the itinerary [GPE] will be a mix of-[GPE] will be all diplomacy, get a chance to see my friend the President, a good discussion about common issues. I will see the Prime Minister of [GPE] for a nice dinner. He will have some interesting events related to [GPE] [DATE]. And then, of course, we go into [GPE] for the Olympics, but there will be a fair amount of diplomacy while I am there. And I am really looking forward to it- looking forward to it because, [CARDINAL], my good wife will be going with me, and I love to travel with her. Secondly, [CARDINAL] of my daughters is going with me, which will be fun. And my brother will be going with me. And in [GPE], I will be meeting my father, who will be traveling with my sister. A big family reunion, [INTERVIEWED]. It sounds that way. Anyway, I am looking forward to it; I am excited to go. Relations with the [CARDINAL] nations that I have just described are good, strong. My trip will help advance them, the relations. And I will also be giving a speech in [GPE] about our foreign policy in the Far East, where I will be leaving this foreign policy in [DATE]. I will also remind people that I will be sprinting to the finish, that I will finish this job strong. And so I want to thank you for coming by and giving me a chance to visit with you. We will go a couple of rounds here. Thank you, sir. It is a long question, and I will probably-I do not know how to put it, but your strongest allies in Asia are [GPE] and [GPE], recently on a tug-of-war game [DATE] over this little island called Dokdo. And I know it is [NORP] get very upset because every time-- I want to make some news with you. Pardon me? I will make some news for you [DATE]. Yes, sir, that would be great--because, you know, [NORP] get upset over this island because whenever the [NORP] mention that-you know, it is like the [NORP] expansionism in the region and so on. You know, when the [GPE] Get ready. Yes, so-- Are you ready for some news? I am ready for some news, please. First of all, this dispute will be settled by [GPE] and [GPE]. As to the database, I asked [PERSON] to review it, and the database will be restored to where it was prior, [DATE]. Thank you, sir. That is big news. It is news. It is big news. Right. And I think [NORP] will really appreciate that, because-- Congratulations on breaking this. Do you have some vision regarding to this, like, [GPE]-[GPE] sort of trilateral cooperation when you go to [GPE]? Between? The [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE]. Well, look, part of my- one of the reasons why it is very important for [GPE] to have an active presence and to establish good bilateral relations with the countries in the region is to help foster good relations between countries, whether it be [GPE] and [GPE], or [GPE] and [GPE]; it is essential. And it is in our national interest that [GPE] have good relations with [GPE]. And I understand there is tensions. I listen very carefully to the respected leaders. But first of all, we cannot fix certain disputes; that will be up to the sovereign governments. But we can help facilitate dialogue. We can help facilitate understandings. And so I think it is very important for [GPE] to be very active and have a good, solid presence and have vibrant diplomacy, which is what this administration has had. Part of the reason that I am stopping in [GPE] prior to going to the Olympics-I mean, one could have attempted just to go straight to the Olympics, but I want to come to [GPE]-I had just come from [GPE], and it is all part of making sure that our foreign policy is active. I would hope that no President would ever dial us out of the Far East. Quite the contrary, I think it is very important for us to stay actively engaged in the Far East. And [CARDINAL] such multilateral engagement is the [CARDINAL]-party talks, all aimed at keeping- dealing with a very delicate issue, but with [CARDINAL] partners sending the same message to your neighbor to the north. So it is part of a foreign policy vision that is multilateral in nature, with strong bilateral relations that help create an atmosphere in which old grievances and new issues can be solved in a peaceful way. Are you going to deliver the FTA message to [NORP]? Absolutely, delivered it [DATE]. Went to a meeting of the [NORP]-U.S. Business Alliance for a reason, I went in there to make it clear that this administration absolutely thinks it is essential that [ORG] pass the [NORP] FTA. And I will deliver it again because I know the President is concerned about whether or not-you know, he hears talk out of the [ORG], and I will assure him that this free trade agreement is in our interest, in [GPE] interest, and that we want to get it done. [INTERVIEWED], you mentioned just now that in [GPE], you are going to be sending a message of [GPE] commitment to foreign policy, what your views are, and that you are going to sprint to the finish.Just-in [CARDINAL] parts-some would argue that during your Presidency, you know, obviously the [GPE] is focused on the war on terror-[GPE], [GPE], [GPE]-and that meant probably in the views of some that the [GPE] was less engaged in Asia, especially vis-a-vis countering the influence of [GPE], which has grown, and that basically your foreign policy has been pretty much like previous administrations, which lacked more higher level of proactive stance; some compared it to the [PERSON] period. How would you describe your legacy under your Presidency for Asia and [GPE] relations? And point [CARDINAL], looking ahead with the changes happening with [GPE] growing stronger, [GPE] growing stronger, that is going to change the dynamics of the region and the [GPE] is a global player in the world. How do you see [GPE] role in that region in the future? Let me start with the second, then you can refresh my [DATE] memory for the first. There is plenty of room for countries to work with-the [CARDINAL] countries you mentioned with other countries in the region in a constructive way. In other words, I do not view the diplomacy as [CARDINAL] sum, it is got to be either this country or that country. [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] will provide great opportunities for entrepreneurs, businesses throughout the region. And they will provide great opportunities for development of services and goods that people in our big markets want. It provides great opportunities for capital flows that are-foreign direct investment, which is necessary for economic development. It will provide opportunities to work collaboratively on strong strategic areas, security areas. [CARDINAL] area will be-there is a great opportunity for all of us to cooperate on the environment. So I view the emergence of [GPE] and [GPE] as positives. I think it is going to be very important for [GPE] to stay engaged, not only with the [CARDINAL] nations. If I were [GPE], I'd be asking, What about us. Will you remember other nations? And the answer is, absolutely. And [CARDINAL] way to do that-the reason I brought up multilateralism is [CARDINAL] way to stay engaged is through the mechanisms like the [CARDINAL]-party talks on the [NORP] issue. Our vision is, once that issue gets solved, if [GPE] verifiably gives up its weapons, programs, ambitions, then the six-party talks can serve as another mechanism. [ORG] is a place where [GPE] can remain-should remain actively engaged with nations who are saying-say, Wait [TIME], we are your friends, as well. Do not just focus on the big guys; think about us. [ORG] is another very important group of nations where we can work in a way that is beneficial, mutually beneficial. And so people may say, Well, okay, fine, how can you? I have gone to every [ORG] meeting, including the one right after September the 11th, 2001; I am going to this one, even after our elections. I will be semiretired by the time I--I will be still sprinting, but semiretired. And in terms of foreign policy in the Far East, it is mistaken if someone were to say that my preoccupation was on the war on terror. You bet I wanted to make sure that we protected ourselves at home. But that is the same sentiment other people have. Secondly, our foreign policy has been robust in the Far East. Our relations with your country, with [GPE], with [GPE], and with [GPE] have never been better. And it took a lot of work to get relations, bilateral relations, as strong as they are. Not many Presidents could say, in the history of [GPE] diplomacy, that relations with [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE] are strong and robust. A lot of times, if you are friends with one, you made it hard to be friends with another. So as a result of a lot of work, a lot of personal diplomacy, as well as a lot of active engagement throughout our administration, I can tell you that I am satisfied with the variety of relationships. Secondly, we have worked on common problems together. Who would have ever thought that [GPE] would have forces in [GPE], or [GPE] would be alongside a lot of other nations in [GPE]? Need to send more. Yes. My only point to you is, is that-or the [GPE]-[NORP] relationship and that issue. It is a very sensitive issue for [ORG]. And people who study this very closely will see that the issue is in a better place. And I made it abundantly clear that there was some red lines for [GPE] on this issue, that there would be no unilateral declaration of independence, that our policy was still the same. It is very important for the President to be very consistent. And my only point to you is, is that I am very pleased with the state of relations now, and I recognize it took a lot of work to get them there. But I feel very comfortable in telling you that if there is a common problem, I have got personal relationships with the leaders where I can sit down and say, here is my point of view, what is yours? And if we have a common problem, let us work it out. We have had some common problems and some issues that have arisen, and yet I will tell you that relations are very cordial and open and honest. And so anyway, good question. Yes. Thank you very much, indeed, President, for this opportunity and your time. And you know that it will be the 30th anniversary of establishment of the diplomatic relations with-- That is a true statement. Yes. And I noted [DATE] many ministers from your administration attended the inauguration ceremony of [NORP] new chancellery building, [FAC]. Yes. So plus, you have made important increase in the importance of bilateral relations. So my question is, how do you evaluate the current relations, the welcome of the bilateral relations for [DATE], especially near [DATE] under your Presidency? Well, thank you very much-- And which areas do you think [CARDINAL] countries could broaden and deepen cooperation? I do. First, I will be dedicating a new Embassy-- Oh yes, I am sure you will preside over the new [FAC]. I have got a new [FAC] going. So yes, there was a deal here [TIME] that people in my administration went to. But I will just tell you what I am going to. I am going to the [FAC]-the new [FAC] opening in [GPE]. Is not that interesting? [CARDINAL] new [FAC] open [DATE] obviously to celebrate the 30th anniversary of what has been a very important relationship. It will be at that [FAC] opening that I will be joined by my father, who first introduced me to [GPE] in [DATE]. I went to visit him-- And so the friend of [NORP] people. Yes. And so I spent my time riding a bicycle around [GPE]. And there was no highrises. So the next time I go as President, and it was like going into another world. It was-there were a lot of cars, a lot of skyscrapers. And you did not bicycle. I did bicycle. I mountain biked with the [NORP] mountain biking team, the Olympic team-I rode with the [NORP] Olympic team. As a matter of fact, I am going to mountain bike again on the Olympic-hopefully, on the Olympic course, just to get some exercise. And so my only point to you is that this has been an evolving relationship, and we are both honoring the 30th anniversary of the relationship. The fact that both countries are honoring [DATE] of the relationship shows that-it is a statement about good relations. If we had bad relations, we would not be honoring [DATE]. It would be, Okay, here comes the 30th anniversary, who cares? But this has got a-opening new [ORG] in our respective capitals, and very fine Embassies-[PERSON] did the one here, and I am not sure who designed ours, but I know it is going to be a great [ORG]-is a signal of how important the relationship is. I mean, we will let the historians evaluate the difference between what the relationship was like in [DATE] [DATE], but I can tell you how-my view. [CARDINAL], I have had good relations with-good personal relations with [PERSON] and [PERSON]. Secondly, we have worked hard during my time to put strategic dialogues in place that broaden and enhance the relationship. So Secretary [PERSON] has worked with his [CARDINAL] counterparts to deal with economic issues that are-it is very important. It is very important for us; it is very important for other nations in the region, by the way. And you know, we are working the currency issue or trade issues or international property rights-or intellectual property rights, I mean. And it is an opportunity for our [CARDINAL] countries, who've got a interesting relationship, to be able to work through common problems and to seize common opportunities. I have been committed to broadening our defense cooperation and exchanges. I think it is going to be very important for-I know it is important for our generals and admirals to deal with their counterparts. And I believe, more importantly, or as importantly, we ought to be getting younger [NORP] officers involved with younger [GPE] officers. Why? To create a feeling of trust. You ask how has the relationship evolved. The crisis of my administration, the first crisis, was the EP-3. And it was like, Oh man, this is unbelievable. And it-I will tell you-and frankly, it took a while to get phone calls returned, and we were just trying to get information. And I am confident that if a incident like that happened now, there would be a much more immediate response because there is more trust between the [CARDINAL] administrations. And that is good for the region. It is good for our bilateral relations and good for the region. So I would tell you that ours has been an evolving relationship that is in good, solid shape. And that is not to say that-on any of these relationships, that there needs to be constant work. An [NORP] President has got to know [CARDINAL] things: [CARDINAL], the nature of the person he is dealing with, and the nature of the government he is dealing with, and the pressures that government feels. And I have worked hard to be a sensitive, open-minded person to that end. Yes. How are you, lad? Good, thanks. Good. A lot of people in [GPE] talk about this. Looking ahead, do you think it is important for the [NORP] people to sort of view [GPE] mostly as a strategic competitor or more as a partner? I would call it a-I would-I think as we look ahead I would view it as a management of a complex relationship, where sometimes our national interests are aligned and sometimes our national interests are not aligned. They could-and let me just talk about the economy, for example. And [CARDINAL] reason I call it a complex relationship is that here in [GPE], trade with [GPE] is not necessarily universally accepted as good. It is universally accepted as good in this administration. I mean, free and fair trade is good for the world, and I believe it is good for this relationship. But it is a-some in [GPE] view the advent of [NORP] manufacturing, particularly at the lower end of the economic scale, as direct competition with their own livelihood, thereby making the relationship complex. Energy-what is very interesting is that if you view [GPE] as a market, you want them to become more robust and more prosperous. But in order to do that, [GPE] is going to have to have more energy, and as [GPE] demands more energy, it creates more global demand relative to a slower growing supply, means higher prices for us all. It is a very interesting and important relationship made complex by globalization, and their constantly changing internal situation, particularly when it comes their economy. I am sure you have been reading about the [GPE] discussions. On the [CARDINAL] hand, we have got very good relations. On the other hand, it was hard to find common ground to get the [GPE] deal closed. And so it is -your readers have got to know that there is opportunity and there is challenges. So it is hard to label the relationship one way or the other. I will tell you this: An [NORP] President is going to have to pay very close attention to relations with not only [GPE], but the region. And I say the region because if it ever-if the perception is ever that [GPE] is fixated only on [GPE], then you are going to have issues with long-time allies, people that have been counting on the [NORP] support for a period of time. And so never can the foreign policy be viewed as [CARDINAL] sum. It is always got to be viewed as additive. And my worry for [GPE] over time is that we have become isolationist and protectionist. I have spoken about this quite frequently. Protectionism will be bad for our own economy and our world economy, in my judgment. Isolationism will create a lot of concern. And so [GPE] has got a forward-leaning foreign policy in the Far East, and we have. When people take an objective look at this administration, we have been very much engaged. And I believe I will be leaving office with the Far East in as good as shape as it can be from a [GPE] perspective. [CARDINAL] other issue on this [GPE] nuclear deal. I understand it is a headache and you are sprinting as fast as you can, but [NORP] does not seem like they are keeping up with the pace. So maybe you could give me some more breaking news on this end. What about the delisting of [GPE] from the terrorist list, what about the verification process, what about [GPE] No, no, no, no, no. Sprinting is [CARDINAL] thing; undermining good policy is another. And multilateral diplomacy is the best way to peacefully solve an issue such as the nuclearization or the weaponization or the desire to have a nuclear weapon program by [NORP]. I will do nothing to undermine the [CARDINAL]-party structure, the credibility of the [CARDINAL]-party structure, and our partners. And therefore, to answer your question, we are very clear that in order to move forward in the phase that we are now in- and this is a phased-in deal-that there must be verification that we are all happy with, a verification mechanism on not only plutonium, but also highly enriched uranium, as well as proliferation. --weapons program as well. Yes, right. And we will obviously consult very closely with our partners. This will be a subject of discussion with the President. And I will be sprinting, but patient; sprinting, but realistic. Okay. Is the [NORP] human- [NORP] refugees, human rights issues will be discussed? Absolutely. As you know, I am a believer in human dignity and human rights. I discuss it with all leaders. And I am-for example, when it comes to [GPE], we have constantly asked [GPE] not to send people back into [GPE]. I want to thank the [NORP] people for welcoming their brothers and sisters who have been able to escape. It is what they need to do. Yes, I know. We thank you for-- It is not easy. We need to open up-we have opened up our doors. And the first step-the [CARDINAL] things on my mind now in [GPE] are getting rid of the nuclear weapons program, which, as you know, can be very destabilizing. When [GPE] fires rockets or tests, it creates reverberations around the immediate area. And secondly, is to recognize-constantly keep in mind the human rights violations that take place there. [INTERVIEWED], again, back to [GPE], you were going to mention something about [GPE], questions on [GPE]. I did, yes. Obviously, it is an issue with human rights. [GPE] is a concern for the [GPE] It is also a concern for quite a number of members of [ORG]. But there is a view again that that is [CARDINAL] issue that is hindering a more advanced cooperation between [GPE] and [ORG] as an organization. What is your view on this, your take on that? I do not think so. I do not think so. I think-I do not think-matter of fact, I think our relations are very strong. I think they have been strong on counterterrorism and the economy. There is a difference about how hard people should push for democracy in [GPE]. I am at [CARDINAL] end of the ledger. And we will continue to press hard. And I do want to thank [ORG] for its understanding of the refugee issue, particularly as relates to the border policy. I think it is been very wise and very humane. My message is going to be one directed to the people in [GPE] when I meet with some of the activists, and [PERSON] is going to be meeting with some of the people that she got to know. Tell you an interesting story. I included [GPE] in my last [ORG] address, and it was a pretty strong statement. And she was in the audience there at the [ORG] And just as soon as the speech ended she got an e-mail from [CARDINAL] of the activists she had met, a person that was trying to help deal with human suffering. And I just thought it was interesting world we are in, in which the speech finishes; the word gets out; they e-mail back to Mrs. [PERSON], or [PERSON], to thank me, as I walked off the podium. Now, it is -my only point to you is that it is very important for us to-I understand pressures on countries, and I understand different interests. And I always try to put myself in the other person's shoes. But as I do so, I never forget certain basic fundamental values. And so we will be-I will be and [PERSON] will be expressing our opinion in a way that is, I hope, very clear and hopeful to people. [GPE] is a democracy. We are having some problems. Democracy is not easy, right? Right. On the other hand, it is a democracy, and they will work through an issue, no question about it. The country next door to you is not and wants to hear that people remember them. See, one of my concerns is that we-that [GPE] gets so comfortable they say, Who cares? What does it matter whether or not somebody has got HIV/AIDS? One of the things on [ORG] you ask about is that part of our AIDS initiative that I am going to go sign a bill [TIME], which is a firm commitment to dealing with disease is in [GPE]. Is not that interesting? And my only point will be that we are a compassionate country amongst a lot of other things. We are an idealistic country. We act for-you know, we act-at least this administration has-not afraid to make tough decisions if needed, particularly given the world in which we live, in which there are people that are willing to kill the innocent to achieve their political objectives. But we are also a very compassionate nation. And it is interesting that a nation- you asked about [ORG] relations and bilateral relations-it is interesting that a nation with which this country had been at war is now a country that is receiving HIV/ AIDS help to help deal with a human catastrophe. My trip to [GPE], by the way, was a fascinating experience when I went. And it is an interesting marketplace economy that is beginning to grow. It is. Vibrant. And it provides great opportunities for people in the neighborhood. Yes. President, just a followup question to my first question. And you know the bilateral relations between [GPE] and [GPE] had been improved under your Presidency, and now it is -. But what would be your expectation and predictions of the future bilateral relation under the new [NORP] administration, [NORP] or [NORP]? [INTERVIEWED]1: Yes, thank you. Well, the only thing I can tell you with certainty is what it is going to be like for [DATE]: sprinting to the finish. Our relations are becoming more and more interwoven and-our economic relations are very, you know, intricate and- you know, there is dependency in a way; there is a lot of capital gain invested; there is marketplaces. As I mentioned, a strategic dialogue that Secretary [PERSON] set up-it is constantly evaluating different opportunities dealing with the current problems, but also dealing with strategic opportunities. I would predict to you that whoever follows me will have a-will be a combination of an active engagement with a constant reminder of our belief in human freedom and human liberty. My second-- That is your third question. --the Beijing, again, is a very important event, not only for [GPE], but also for the whole world. So your stance against politicizing the Olympic Games is highly- -by [NORP] people. So what you would like to convey, your messages and wishes to the 29th Beijing Olympic Games and nothing special to [NORP] people, because [NORP] people has made tremendous efforts to ensure the Olympic Games is a successful event; even sometimes they make some sacrifices. Yes. Well, our message is, is that I personally-and [GPE] respects the [NORP] people-respect your history, respect your tradition, and I am honored to have been invited to the games. And I make the case to people that by going to the games and respecting the people, it gives me a-it gives me credibility with the Government so that we can deal with common opportunities and common problems. And I will have a bilateral with [PERSON], which I am looking forward to. I enjoy the man. I find him to be a straightforward guy; I am very comfortable in his presence. And we will talk about the kinds of issues we always talk about. So for me it is going to be a real pleasure to see the Olympics. I am a sportsman; I love sports. As I mentioned, I am looking forward-I hope I will be riding my mountain bike on the mountain bike trail. I will probably be taking the easiest route because the hills looked quite steep the last time I was there. And I am going to go to see some of the events. As I understand it, I think we have got a chance to go see the [GPE] basketball team versus [GPE], which ought to be a pretty interesting event. I bet it is pretty noisy, as I understand the great [PERSON]--who plays for my old hometown, [GPE]-the [ORG]-foot is healed. I hope so, because it will make it a very interesting contest. I look forward to watching the fan reaction and to seeing good healthy competition. I am fascinated by the Chinese Olympics teams' efforts to capture the most medals. I think good competition is very healthy. They are going to-and so it'll be fun to watch, and it'll be really interesting to see not only the sports and to feel the atmosphere of the Olympics-I have never been to a [DATE] Olympics before-but also to cheer on my team, because our objective is to get more medals than anybody. That is what competition is about. And if we do, we will be gracious in victory, and if we do not , we will be humble in defeat. But I will be there as the President of the country cheering the team when it comes in the Olympic stadium, going by different venues, and just letting them know [GPE] is cheering for them. And so that is going to be exciting. And as I say, there will be diplomacy. We are opening a new [FAC]. I will have a bilateral dinner, a lunch with the President, a meeting, and then I think his wife and my wife will join us, so it'll be a nice social occasion. And then there will be the Olympic committees and all the stuff you are supposed to do. But what kind of specific events you would like, you and Mrs. [PERSON] would like most, and you will watch during the-- Yes. Well, I like a lot of sports. Unfortunately, we are not going to be there-the most exciting, in many ways for kind of a baby boomer like me, is the track and field. That is like-that is it, to watch the sprinters and the different big events and-- [ORG] Press Secretary [PERSON]. Get some tips, get some sprinting tips. Yes--sprinting tips. That is [PERSON]. We are not going to be there for that. So, you know what, we will see. I am pretty relaxed about it. Not every single minute of [DATE] has to be totally organized, and so I will be with a lot of my family, and they are fun to hang around with. I am sure we will walk around the different venue sites and just get a sense for the whole atmosphere of people from all around the world coming to [GPE] to compete in the Olympic Games. That is going to be a proud moment for the [NORP] people. And I made a decision not to politicize the games; this is for athletics. There is plenty of time for politics, and I am confident I will have time for politics and, you know-look, I have met with the [NORP] President a lot. This is not like once every 4 years you sit down with the man. I meet with him all the time, it seems like, at these different forums where [GPE] is at the table with a lot of other nations in the region. And I have got very cordial relations, and it is important to be able to have those kind of relations, because he is got to tell me what is on his mind and I have got to tell him what is on my mind in order to be able to deal with problems. And I think when people study my Presidency and find out how [PERSON] conducted foreign policy, they will see I do not shy away from things; I am not a shy person. And if we have a problem, we can discuss it. And so the first time I met with your President at [FAC]-first [NORP] President to ever go to [FAC]; he came-I knew there was some potential problems. And I wanted to put him in a frame of mind, in an atmosphere where he'd feel comfortable. Well, you have a knack to charm other leaders, and he was fascinated, actually. He is an interesting guy. Yes. He told me a fabulous story about his-you know, he is an elder of a huge church, and they asked him to be an elder. And he said, No, I need to park cars to prove to myself and others that I deserve it in the first place. A very interesting story, I thought. Are you worried about the air quality in [GPE]? Am I worried about it? Yes, do you worry about it? I am sure I can adjust. I do not know. I am going anyway. I mean, I will be there. And I do not know what it is like. The only way to find out is to go. I am sure there is all kinds of stories. I have read the paper [DATE] that the air quality was down. Who knows what it is going to be like. We will deal with it. Yes, last question. I have got to go to the electronic media, with people who have got beautiful faces. Well, continuing to talk about the leaders, the [NORP] leaders, what has surprised you about your dealings over [DATE] with [NORP] leadership? That is an interesting question. [CARDINAL] thing that interests me is to watch [GPE]'s leaders deal with the benefits and challenges of a marketplace. In other words, this is a country that has got a lot of mouths to feed and a lot of people to employ. And they are committed to, in many ways, marketplace principles, particularly as they have invited in foreign capital. And it is been interesting to watch them deal with a combination of the need for raw material versus the-from the foreign policy implications of dealing with a country that has a lot of raw material. The classic case is [GPE], where I have spent a lot of time with the [NORP] President talking about the dangers of [GPE] having a nuclear weapon, knowing full well that they need fuel in order to meet their own internal pressures. And I will repeat to you: [PERSON] has been very open in many ways about his concerns and the pressures he feels, as have I. And I feel comfortable. And by the way, that is not easy when there is a language barrier. And yet I can report to you that we do have cordial, relaxed conversations in spite of the fact that we both have interpreters. It is much easier when you are dealing with a person that speaks your own language. Since the only one I speak is English, it is important to have English speakers. But here is a man who I have had some-I feel comfortable talking about his family, and he asks about mine. And that may sound trite to you, but nevertheless, it is a part of getting comfortable with each other. So I guess what is interesting is to- just understanding the tensions that an emerging economy can feel, and particularly given [NORP]-the [NORP] role in international affairs, for example, their presence in [ORG], [ORG], which creates interesting tensions. I would say that there is been a-it is just been interesting to watch, and interesting to participate with people. I mean, the [GPE] issue was a very touchy issue for a while, causing me to say in [FAC]-that which is now well-chronicled- that [GPE] does not support a unilateral declaration of independence. Because I wanted to make sure that our message was clear, but also that the relationship was in a way-not our relationship, but others' relationship with [GPE] was in a way that it could evolve peacefully and constructively. [INTERVIEWED], you mentioned about sprinting. Bullet points: What if you could guard [CARDINAL] points, what is left to be done in the sprint? There is a lot left to be done. [CARDINAL], make sure that the [CARDINAL]-party talks continue to-are you talking about the Far East, or just in general? Yes, the region. The region. [CARDINAL]-party talks, what else? It was-like, total agenda? There is a lot. Sure. But I am just saying-- But in the Far East-absolutely. [CARDINAL]-party talks is [CARDINAL]. Go to [ORG] and have a successful conclusion. Meet with [ORG] nations to leave the relationship in a solid way. Continue pressing hard on the human rights agenda, human freedom agenda, a religious freedom agenda. There is [CARDINAL] issues right there. Yes, free trade agreement. Absolutely. Concluding a relationship with-continuing to work with [GPE] on their defense forces posture, particularly given OEF. I mean, there is a lot to be done. And just to make sure that people understand, the bilateral relationships are vital. Let us see, I have been to [GPE] [CARDINAL] times as President; [GPE] is going to be my second time; [GPE], [CARDINAL] times. I mean, I have been there a lot. Is that right, [CARDINAL] times to [GPE]? Yes. And this is your ninth trip to Asia. Ninth trip to Asia. But still you will come-- I am looking forward to it. You know the thing that amazes me? The [NORP] women golfers. Look at a women's-have you ever looked at the scoreboard? Yes, sure. It is unbelievable. I do not know-- Yes, you are supposed to know. If you look at the scoreboard, it is phenomenal. You talk about an excellent athletic program. It is actually a [NORP]-born, [NORP]-trained. You think so? I am not sure. I know the woman who won the [ORG], is that what it was-won the Open is [NORP]-born, [NORP]-trained. But I am not so sure-- Mostly they come-like they go to school in [GPE] or [GPE], or something like that. So they-- All of them? Like, I would say [PERCENT]. They come to [GPE] They work out-- Okay. But they have got a pretty-they must have a young girls' program that is pretty active too, to get people interested in the first place. Yes, I think [NORP] women are much more disciplined than [NORP] men. [ORG] Press Secretary [PERSON]. That is not just in [GPE]. Thank you all greatly. Thank you. Enjoyed it. Thank you, buddy.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsnorthcarolinagovroycooperpressconferencetranscriptmay22", "text": "We will ask the media for their questions. If you could, identify yourself and your organization. We can take the first question. Our first question will be from [INTERVIEWER0], [ORG]. Hello, [INTERVIEWED1]. With the Coca-Cola 600 coming up [DATE], how confident are you that [DATE] of racing in [FAC] can be done safely? Did [GPE] health officials learn anything or see any concerns when they attended the health screen process at [FAC]? Well, thank you for that question. Our health officials have worked closely with [ORG] and [ORG] to ensure a safe Coca-Cola 600 [DATE]. I know a lot of people are looking forward to this live sporting event on TV. I know that I am. We are glad that since [ORG], [GPE] is the home of [ORG], that we are going to be having this event here. [ORG] was very thoughtful in their plan for protecting employees and drivers and pit crews and people working on the cars from COVID-19. They submitted a plan to [ORG]. Also, local health officials work with them. Our local health officials gave them feedback on the plan. I think that they are ready to put on a very safe race. Obviously no spectators will be there, and that is because we know that gatherings together, when people gather together, that the risk of infection is so much higher. This is why we continue to have in our executive order the mass gathering ban. I do not know about the situation regarding [GPE]. Do you know anything about it, [INTERVIEWED2]? About any feedback we got? From everything I have heard, things went fine there, but we will get any reports back to see if any changes are going to be made at [FAC] from things learned at [GPE], but I do not have the answer to that right now. Thanks. Next question. [INTERVIEWER1]. Hi, [INTERVIEWED1]. [INTERVIEWER1] here, [ORG]. My question for you is about youth sports. The only part of the executive order that explicitly mentioned sports dealt with, we presume, [ORG], because it mentioned for broadcast on television. We have been getting a lot of questions from little league administrators and other youth sports coordinators, swim team, travel, basketball, you name it. Is that in your opinion right now, a Phase Two thing, or is that a Phase Three thing or is it somewhere in between? Sports are so important to the formation of character, for fitness. I love sports. I grew up participating on sport teams all the way through high school, and I know how important they can be for the education of children. Start out knowing that this is something that we want to have happen as much as we can as we approach [DATE]. At the same time, we have to understand the presence of COVID-19. I do not think that we have all of the answers to those questions yet. I know that our staff is working closely with [ORG], and I think I will let [INTERVIEWED2] come up and make a few comments about that and what she has been doing on that front. Thank you [INTERVIEWED1]. As far as high school and other youth sports, we will be putting out guidance [DATE] on that. It is recommendation. The reason you did not see it in the executive orders is there are no requirement, but we do have public health recommendations for folks, particularly that run the leagues and the facilities that host these sporting events. Our recommendations generally fall in [CARDINAL] big bucket here is around contact sports. We know that contact sports like basketball or football, where you are in each other's personal spaces and you are breathing out respiratory droplets on other, we know that that is a higher way of spreading the virus as opposed to non-contact sports like tennis or baseball or individual sports like swimming or golf. Those non-contact sports, we said that that is fine to proceed from a recommendation perspective, but then we do have some guidance on how to do each of those activities safely. We are not recommending contact sports go forward, but for non-contact sports to go forward, but with a set of guidelines. Again, all of these are recommendations and we have worked, as [INTERVIEWED1] mentioned, with athletic associations across [GPE]. We hope to have that guidance posted [DATE] for folks to take more of a look at. Thank you. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED2]. Next question, please. [INTERVIEWER2], Hey, [INTERVIEWED1]. This is [INTERVIEWER2] from [ORG]. Hope you are doing well. My question for you is, are you personally comfortable with eating inside of a restaurant [DATE]? I have been [CARDINAL] places. I have been the executive residence and I have been here at the emergency operation center. Yes, I would feel comfortable going to a restaurant, not saying that I am necessarily going, because I hope I can spend some time with my family [DATE]. We are continuing to work on issues here and we will be working through [DATE]. But yes, I would feel comfortable. I would certainly want that restaurant to be following all of the personal safety rules and doing everything they can to prevent the transfer of COVID-19. We hope that that people will feel safe enough to go to our restaurants throughout the state. We hope that all of the restaurants continue to obey the rules. I think they will find that that is good business for them to do that. Thanks. Next question. [INTERVIEWER3], [ORG]. Hi, [INTERVIEWED1]. Wanted to ask you please, what conversations are you having with large entertainment or convention venues? Should they expect to be closed for [DATE] to come? And [INTERVIEWED2], ..., is the state tracking the number of positives that are from asymptomatic versus symptomatic people? Is that a metric we could have soon? Thanks very much. Yes. And I will let [INTERVIEWED2] address both of those, but our office is having conversations with these large event venues who obviously want to begin the process of having people back in them. These are the kinds of places that are much higher risk for COVID-19 and transferring it from [CARDINAL] person to another. So, obviously right now where we are in phase [CARDINAL] of the executive order, we would not have any of these large gatherings, but we are certainly planning ahead for the potential of them being open at some capacity and are trying to figure out exactly what that would look like safety. And I will let [INTERVIEWED2] answer both of those questions if she would. Hi, [INTERVIEWER3]. So, let me do that symptomatic and asymptomatic. We do not track that for all of our cases, but what I would draw your attention to on our website and on our dashboard, we post surveillance data and I would direct you to that surveillance data, which does show some information that we are starting to collect about symptomatic and asymptomatic spread. As we have been talking about related to COVID-19, is that we are seeing a fair amount of spread of this virus by folks who do not have any symptoms, who are asymptomatic. That is one of the primary reasons why the [CARDINAL] W's is so important. So, we are not tracking that for all of our cases. When we get information back from the lab, it is very minimal data. There are certain places where our public health team does more in depth study, particularly the surveillance work and prevalence studies. Those are the things where we are going to be able to get more symptom-based information and link it with some of this data. So, I direct you to our surveillance data to start. And I will just echo what the [INTERVIEWED1] mentioned about large venues. We know mass gatherings are places when folks, particularly when they are indoors, close together for longer periods of time and sitting, those are the places where they are higher risk. We actually know that [GPE] first cases here in the state were seeded from a mass gathering up in new England. So, we know that those kinds of events have huge implications, not just for here in [GPE], but can cross state. So, those are things that are concerning. We definitely want to take precautions as we go here, and I think that we are trying to step through that. We want to look at our numbers and understand how are we doing with the easing of restrictions that we are putting in place that only just start [TIME]. Let us look at our numbers and we will see as we go here. But again, mass gatherings is one of the hardest because it does bring so many people together and has such a high risk of spreading the virus to so many people at the same time. Thank you. Thank you. Next question, please. News and Observer. [INTERVIEWED1], this is... Thank you for taking my question. What is the responsibility of restaurants, businesses, churches, anything not open from the public to report to the public and state about new cases or outbreaks tied to their establishments? This ... staffers and diners. I will let you handle that, [INTERVIEWED2]. Sure. Thank you. There are certain industries that are regulated in terms of required to report to us. As was mentioned, the restaurant industry is highly regulated and we continue to do inspections, but in terms of reporting outbreaks, that would be [CARDINAL] or more cases or reporting clusters, that would be [CARDINAL] cases. Restaurants are not one of the industries that are required to report back to us. Now, we often do want those restaurants to get in touch with our public health departments if there is an issue, because we want to work in close collaboration with them to make sure that they are doing all of the right things to prevent further spread of the infection. But there are just a few industries that are required by law to report to us. Those are settings like nursing homes and again, that is why you see those reported on our website. Thank you. Thank you. Next question, please. [INTERVIEWER4], [ORG]. Hi there, [INTERVIEWED1]. [INTERVIEWER4] here with [ORG]. I wanted to ask you about lawsuits. First, there was the suit on behalf of churches and then one that was going to be filed on behalf of salon owners. Now, our state representative for [GPE] is organizing a suit that, if successful, would allow all businesses to reopen in phase [CARDINAL]. What is your reaction to these legal challenges and they are affecting how your team's making policy? It would be irresponsible to remove restrictions all at once. Clearly, that is a situation that could result in a massive spike in COVID-19. And our entire effort here has been to slow the spread and to keep our hospital system and medical providers from being overwhelmed, and we have been successful with that. We are beginning to turn the dimmer light up to move into phase We moved into phase [CARDINAL] first. Now, we are moving into phase [CARDINAL] and we are slowly easing restrictions here while remembering that the vast majority of businesses in [GPE] can be open. Some of them are not because of the consequences of this pandemic, whether it be supply chain, whether it be employees that have to stay home. There are businesses that are not operating at full capacity for a lot of reasons. We hope that we have made these orders constitutional. We did have the [CARDINAL] lawsuit regarding houses of worship, where we have made accommodations for that in this order. And we believe that this is a smart way to move forward, to protect the health of [NORP] while also trying to boost our economy. And that goes hand in hand, and we have got to make sure that people have confidence to be able to go out into the economy. And we are doing that and giving them that confidence by talking about things like Count On Me [DATE], but also using the data to make decisions about when it is safe to do more easing of the restrictions. And when people know that that is what we are using to make decisions, not emotions, not politics, but science and data, people will have more confidence and not only will people be healthier but our economy will improve faster. Thank you, next question. [INTERVIEWER7], [ORG]. [INTERVIEWED1]. This is [INTERVIEWER7] from [ORG]. [DATE], Senator [PERSON] sent [ORG] a letter demanding answers to questions and documents that reporters have been asking for for [DATE]. Do you intend to ensure [ORG] will provide those answers and documents, both to Senator [PERSON] and the media? Well, first we want to make sure that all our employees at prisons and inmates are safe and we want to make sure that we abide with all of the public records laws. I have not seen this letter you are talking about, but I do have [INTERVIEWER7] here, our director of prisons, who can provide a response. So, [PERSON], I will let you come forward. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED1]. [TIME], I did receive a communication from Senator [PERSON]'s office and we will be sending a response back very timely. We look forward to the opportunity to answer all of the senator's questions. And quite frankly, we look forward to the opportunity to set the record straight. Thank you. We look forward to the opportunity to set the record straight. Thank you. Thank you. Next question please. [INTERVIEWER5], [ORG]. Thanks [INTERVIEWED1], can you provide more clarity on how craft breweries in the state are classified under the Phase 2 guidelines? [ORG] and others have said they do not believe brewery ... or brew pubs meet the order's definition of a bar, but there seems to be a lot of confusion around this as far as reopening, Right. Our legal team and our departments will be issuing guidance on that [TIME], regarding what establishments fall under what category, there will be a legal distinction there. It is important to know that we have worked very closely with [ORG], making sure that we put in place protections with this count on, on ...program that is going on right now. And we feel really good about where we are with our restaurants, but that clarification will be coming [TIME]. Thanks. Next question. [INTERVIEWER6], [ORG]. Hello, [INTERVIEWED1]. This is [INTERVIEWER6] from [ORG]. Since [DATE], I have been reaching out consistently to [ORG], or security rather, asking them for this [CARDINAL] metric, number of individual applications they either accept or reject [DATE]. Through several exchanges of emails they have promised to give me these numbers, and then either those have never materialized, or they have cited vague concerns with timing that it was not right time to answer this. ...has tried to help me get those numbers, and we have not been successful so far. Is there a reason that you know that would not provide those numbers to the public? It is an important metric to show how quickly they will be able to dig themselves out of the backlog and one that they should have readily assessable if they are monitoring their progress. Thanks for that question, and I am not familiar with that number that you are talking about. They do post numbers of claims that were rejected and claims that have been paid. And right now [CARDINAL] 000 people are receiving benefits of [MONEY]. But this division knows, and I know that there are [CARDINAL] of people who have yet to be paid. And every single family that has applied for unemployment benefits deserves a fair adjudication, and deserves to get paid if they qualify. I know that additional federal money has been activated [DATE], so there will be more opportunities for people to provide unemployment insurance. But I will take those concerns that you have [DATE] and make sure that our communications people get up with you to provide that information to you, if that is something that can be provided under the Public Records Law, and it is supposed to be given out. But thank you for that question, and we will try to get that information to you. Next question, please. Our final question [DATE] will be from [INTERVIEWER8], [ORG]. Thank you for taking my question, this is [PERSON] with [ORG]. We have heard from gyms who have said that they have spent [MONEY] to be ready on everything from air purifiers, hand sanitizers, body wipes, different protocols. We have also heard from bars saying that the restaurants literally right next door to them, can open that how bars in them, but they cannot , and they say they are willing to do whatever they can to open. And the big question here is, do you have anything to say to those businesses that have invested the time to get ready only these told no, even though they were expecting to open? And do you expect the bar and gym restrictions to continue for [DATE]? We appreciate all the businesses in [GPE], and certainly are concerned about those that cannot open right now, but we have to keep the public health and safety of [NORP] as the number [CARDINAL] priority here. [ORG], we are going to continue to work with those businesses, but many of them are high risk for transfer of COVID. For example, the state of [GPE], which has moved a lot faster than [GPE] and easing restrictions still has not opened bars in [GPE], as of right now. And I think we all would know the reason why that would be the case. So what we are doing is moving cautiously, trying not to move with haste, making sure that in this phase, we can watch our numbers to see how [GPE] is doing. And then hopefully we can include those businesses as we move on through the phases in [GPE], but we have got to keep the safety of [NORP] as the number [CARDINAL] priority. Thanks very much for being with us [DATE]. And I hope everyone has [DATE]. Thank you so much.", "discourse_type": 1}

The first question we'd like to ask you, [INTERVIEWED], is one that we have asked the [NORP] Presidential candidates, and that is: What do you think is the most important problem facing [GPE] in [DATE], and what ideas do you have for dealing with it? Well, I think the problem remains-and it is a group of problems-and that is maintaining and continuing this expansion of our economy, so that we can provide jobs with a future and opportunity for all of our people. I think it is the problem of achieving a lasting peace, with the reduction, particularly, of nuclear weapons in the world, to reduce and, hopefully, [DATE] eliminate that threat that hangs over us. I think others-to help, as we can, those nations that are trying to establish democracies and become working members of the family of nations. And, I believe, the restoration of some traditional values of family and neighborhood. The distortion that is occurred down through [DATE] of the relationship within our own country of our different levels of government, and to restore authority and autonomy to those levels where [ORG] has assumed too much of it. I will probably think of several more answers to that later, but- Okay. -but right now, I think that is covered basically: the economy, the economic expansion that is needed and that we have embarked on, and peace in the world and reduction of the tensions and the armaments. Sir, on the deficit question, I noticed [DATE] you joked slightly about it and then emphasized how seriously you take the deficit problem. Could you be more specific? How serious a problem is it, and what would you do to deal with it? Well, that would be a part of the overall generic answer that I gave about the economy. Yes, the deficit is a problem; no one can ignore it. But it is been going on for [DATE], and for most of that time, almost totally in that time, it has been a deliberate part of government policy. And some of us who complained about it back through [DATE] always said that it would get literally out of control, that you could not go on that way without coming to a day of reckoning. And we now are at [DATE] of reckoning. I think the basic part of that deficit is due to government itself and the excessive share of the people's earnings, the gross national product that the government is taking. And so, we are going to continue. We have made a proposal for a down payment over [DATE] that is pretty evenly divided between some revenues, not by raising rates, but by eliminating some tax practices that we think are not fairly distributed. And that, of course, is part of this temporary down payment. But at the same time, I have ordered [ORG] to embark on a study of the entire tax structure-as to how we can collect the uncollected tax that is being evaded by people who owe it and do not pay, simplify the tax structure, broaden the base, hopefully reduce the rates on individuals. You-excuse me-you had mentioned [DATE] in passing that you saw the need at some point to restructure [ORG] for new workers coming into the program. Could you elaborate on that? Well, I think we have to-we have got to look at the whole governmental structure, and this includes the entitlement programs. There have been demographic changes that have been ignored that make some policies now leading inevitably toward [DATE] of reckoning if we do not reorder those programs. [CARDINAL] of your deficit has been structural. [CARDINAL] of your deficit has been cyclical, the result of the recessions. And we are eliminating that [CARDINAL]-the cyclical-by the recovery that has taken place. An evidence of that is that just [DATE] our own projections of the deficit were reduced by [MONEY], because we obtained that much more tax revenue than we had anticipated due to the recovery in the economy. [INTERVIEWED], on the entitlements, can you be more specific about how this restructuring-it is [DATE] in which you are asking voters to return you to office. Cannot you be more specific about what you would do for medicare and [ORG]? No, not really, because this is something that is going to require thorough study to ensure that you do not pull the rug out from under anyone who is presently dependent on those programs. They must not be frightened as they have been by political demagoguery as they were in the [DATE] campaign, when our opponents took advantage of the fact that [ORG]-the program was facing, and by our date as of [DATE]-facing outright bankruptcy. And they denied this. And then they waged a political campaign that we were out-in some way we intended to take the payments-either reduce them or take them away from people dependent on them. And they caused panic among people who were in a-the senior citizens that are not in a position to defend themselves against this when someone says, Oh, did you know that they are going to do this or this or that to you? But you could be more specific- Well.- -and put some of these fears to rest, could not you? Well, I had tried-and everyone seemed to ignore it-I have said over and over again in talking about [ORG] problem, that nothing must be done to penalize those people who are now dependent on those checks. But what we need to do is a revamping of the program. We finally, then, when the election was over and the demagoguery stopped- Yeah. -then our opponents agreed to a bipartisan get-together to find an answer to the immediate problem. But is not it risky now in an election year for you to say that we should revamp and restructure these programs without being specific? No. As long as they understand-and as long as you will print that what I said-that there is no intention on the part of anyone of taking away from those people now getting. And maybe also it would be well if you printed that the rebuttal to the demagoguery of the [DATE] campaign is the fact that [DATE] the average couple, married couple on social security is getting $[MONEY] a month more than they were getting before we came here. So, these are our goals and our purposes. But there is no way to answer until you have gone into a study of the whole actuarial situation. Now, I read in [CARDINAL] of the interviews with [CARDINAL] of the present candidates of the other party, where he was claiming that, Well, there is no problem with [ORG] at all because it is safe till [DATE]. Well, [DATE] is not too far away from [DATE]. Well, how can he so carelessly dismiss the fact that those same people out there, who, as you have said, can be frightened if someone is saying to them, Yes, the program's going to run into another financial bind, but he does not offer any suggestion for solving it. I am saying that what we must do now is more of what we did in that temporary fix- Right. -is a bipartisan facing up to the fact that you ensure that those people are going to get their payments. But let me take [CARDINAL] more pass at this. Do you think, then, in a second term, should you win reelection, that you will want to take another look at these structural problems in social security, as well as [ORG]? As long as it is in the context that we are not going to pull the rug out from anyone who is presently dependent on those programs. Okay. May I ask you a question about the, what you mentioned [TIME], about broadening the tax base, as being an objective in your tax simplification study? Would you accept a tax simplification that does lead to an, in effect, an increased tax burden on [NORP]? Or would your goal be to keep the tax burden the same as it is now? I am looking for a program that can bring about simplification, but I see no need to increase the burden on individuals. This is what-we set out to reduce that- Right. -and simplification-what we are looking toward, and I cannot answer now, because this is a study that has to be made, and it is a very complex subject-when you say broaden the tax base, again, you are talking about involving, in the payment of taxes, people now who, for [CARDINAL] reason or the other, have been able to, in many instances, remain totally tax free or remain well below what they should be paying. And thus it limits your ability to reduce the overall burden on individuals by tax rate cuts because of the lost revenue which, right now, is estimated around [MONEY] a year. Is that what you are basically after, the lost revenue, or would you, in effect, net more with a simplification program? That is - Well, when you look at a simplification program you are also looking at a way of making it impossible for those who are presently evading, to evade. When you say evading, you do not mean evading illegally; you mean from unfair tax breaks, as well, right? Oh, no. An awful lot of outright evading. But in addition to that, you are also talking about loopholes, tax breaks, whatever you want to call it. I hesitate-I will not answer that now, as to what all will be in the study. We are, as I said before, in our present proposal, we are changing some that we believe-while they were undoubtedly well-intentioned, they have led to some taking an-getting an advantage that is denied to others. Where that is true, then that should be corrected, whether you have a deficit or- Right, -have a tax reform or not. On the subject of defense spending, sir, you have accepted a reduction this time around in the budget fight, in the rate of defense growth. We wanted to know whether that is a real reduction, or are you just stretching it out? In other words, you'd have the same buildup at the same cost over a longer period of time. Well, obviously, to have such a-to be able to make such a reduction as we did involves some elements of stretching it out, which means that over a longer period of time the same amount of money is distributed so that you have people taking a longer time with their taxes to pay for it. But the defense budget is not determined by how much you want to spend. It is determined by what is necessary to guarantee our security and thus the ability to preserve the peace. And for those who approach the budget from the standpoint of, Well, let us make it this percentage of the budget or let us cut this amount of money, how do you have national security on that basis? Everything that you are going to cut from the defense budget, you have to say, Does this reduce to an unacceptable point our ability to preserve our security or not? And if it does, then you cannot make that cut. If you can delay, if you can postpone some things and you look and say, Well, in looking at the potential adversaries in the world, what emergencies might arise, this is not an unacceptable risk -we can do this, particularly when it is to help bring about the economic strengthening. Now, we have been doing this, and we have-we ourselves, with all of the talk about defense spending as being the source of added funds for reducing the deficit-and I have seen the terms used many times in the media that- record defense spending. It is record if you take the number of dollars without regard to the value of those dollars. It is far below any record at all. There is no hint of such a thing if you take it as a percentage of the budget or as a percentage of gross national product. And in either [CARDINAL] of those ratings, our defense spending is far below what was customary back through [DATE]. In [DATE] era, [DATE], I believe it was, the defense budget was [PERCENT] of the total budget. It is down [PERCENT] or so now of the budget. It is a smaller percentage of the gross national product than it was then. So, we think that we are really tightening our belt to make this reduction that we are proposing. Now, how do you arrive at lower defense spending ever? You arrive at it by the other thing that we are trying to bring about, and that is a reduction in armaments with those who could be considered possible adversaries. Then, if you have a reduction of the threat, you can have a reduction of the deterrent on our side. And that is a road toward lesser defense spending. We'd like to move on to that subject, but before I ask you about that, let me just ask once more if it is correct to assume that you see this reduction in the rate of growth that has been accepted now as primarily a postponement of the buildup, a deferral of the buildup, or do you see it as causing any elimination of anything that you had in mind? Not in the sense of weapons systems or reducing manpower. There are-let me be honest and say this whole thing is definitely not all postponement. We have been working and, as a matter of fact, had made [MONEY] cut in the defense budget ourselves before we even, then, took this further step. But much of that was based on the things that we, ourselves, have been discovering, as we have in every other area of government, of government practices that could be changed. Some of that spending cut reflects the findings of the [PERSON] commission that we are now implementing. All of this thing that you all have had such a field day with, with regard to wrenches costing [MONEY] and bolts costing [MONEY] when they should cost [MONEY] and so forth-no one has published those are our figures. We found that that was going on, and we are the ones who have changed that. And already the savings are at [MONEY] of rebates that have come back to us, to say nothing of the future savings now of correcting that practice. And there have been indictments, [CARDINAL] of them, for fraud and things of that kind. Incidentally, how much of a shock was that for you. What? How much of a shock was that for you to discover the amount of conniving that defense contractors might attempt? Well, it had to be quite a shock, when you first came up with a finding of some little gizmo that you could buy in a store off the shelf for [CARDINAL] or less of what we were paying for it. Do not you wish you could have had some of those when you were campaigning? Yes--yes. May I ask you about the East-West tensions, which you raised or mentioned [TIME]? Are there no further steps that [GPE] can take unilaterally, now, to reduce tensions with [GPE] or to persuade them to return to the negotiating table? For instance, submitting the threshold test ban treaty for ratification, which, I think, is on their list. We are in conversations with [GPE] on a number of things of this kind. And on things like-we will soon be talking about a chemical warfare treaty-and with regard to their position, I think the tensions are, frankly, more evident in rhetoric than they are in actuality. I think that there is less tension [DATE] and less threat and danger with the rebuilding that we have done that makes us more secure than there was earlier when our defenses were so lax that there was a window of vulnerability. No, we-and they have agreed now to come back into negotiations on [CARDINAL] of the [CARDINAL] treaties that they walked out on, the conventional weapons treaty, the multiple balanced force [mutual and balanced force reductions] MBFR treaty. We are hopeful that they will come back in the others. We have made it plain that we are flexible, that while we have made a proposal, we have evidenced our willingness to negotiate in what may be differing views of theirs. An example of that in the intermediate-range weapons in Europe: My first proposal was-and I think it was a commonsense proposal-and that was [CARDINAL] on both sides, eliminate them all, and that type of weapon. Well, the [NORP] would not hear of that. We said all right, then, granted that would be our goal-and we think it is a good goal-but we are willing, then, to talk whatever reduction in numbers that we can make that will be verifiable, that will be fair and even for both sides. And that still remains on the table. But the administration seems to have taken the position now that no new revisions or new revised proposals will be offered until they come to the negotiating table, and then you might have something. Is that a correct description? No, what we are saying is we are not going to sit here and negotiate with ourselves and while they sit out there not participating- Right. -waiting to see what we will finally come up with. That would be very poor negotiating strategy. We have said to them, we are flexible. We are willing to negotiate fair and verifiable agreements when they are ready to come back to the table. Do you think that by not negotiating or not going back to the table the [NORP] might be trying to influence the outcome of the [NORP] election? Oh, I do not think someone could rule that out. I am not going to make the charge, but I am not going to also guess at what might be their-part of their problems might simply be with the change now in leadership, that they are in a period of putting their shop together. On an informal level, do you have a better reading of the new leader there, or have you been in touch with him in some way, in some oblique way-[PERSON]? Well the Vice President had an opportunity to meet with him when he was there. And, as I say, there is communication between our [CARDINAL] governments, and we remain optimistic that we can arrive at agreements. In the first place, we want them, and they need them. [PERSON], do you want to ask about the Middle East- The Middle East. In [DATE] it would seem that the Government-[ORG] might have misjudged the stability of [GPE] and [ORG] and the effectiveness of its army and the willingness of [GPE] to cooperate with some of our stratagems. Are you satisfied with the basic information you have gotten on what-that was the underpinning for your strategy there? Were you misinformed in the first place or what? No, we knew that what we were attempting to help with was a very complex and complicated problem. And what we and our allies joined together to do was based on the necessity for a withdrawal of the foreign forces that were in there. Remember that when this all started, [GPE], because of the violations of its own northern border by the [NORP], the [ORG], had gone all the way to [GPE]. War was being fought in the city streets there with the [ORG]. Casualties among civilians were probably exceeding those of the military. The [NORP], they were also on [NORP] soil. And we went in to help bring about the removal of the [ORG], who felt that any effort to surrender could result in a massacre, and they were-[CARDINAL] were removed from the country. [GPE] had indicated that it, too, would leave, the [NORP] would leave, and then [GPE] changed its mind. That was unanticipated. But even so, the purpose of the troops of [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and ourselves were there to more or less help maintain order while a government, a viable government of [GPE] was created and then to help train-which we did-their army to then go out and occupy the areas occupied by foreign forces-[GPE] and [GPE]-as they withdrew, because, also, in those areas were the militias, the unofficial armies that had been fighting each other and fighting the government, such as it was, in [GPE]. Now, for quite some time, progress was made. And I still have to say right now the progress, the meetings that have taken place in [GPE] would not have taken place had all of us not done what we did. It is true that when [GPE] balked and began supporting some of the rebel elements-but our whole idea was that for [GPE]-or for [GPE] to have a government, they were going to have to make peace with those militias and find some kind of a broad-based government. And they have set out and they have tried to do that. It did not succeed. But the very fact that all of us began to be subject to terrorist attacks and change the basing of our troops-us putting them on ships offshore and so forth-actually was evidence of the fact that we were succeeding. And those who did not want success knew that one of the steps in having their way was to force the withdrawal of our own forces. Was the level of success, as you describe it, worth the price that we paid, the dead marines? I do not know how you answer this thing that is becoming worldwide now, the terrorist method of suicide attacks and so forth. I'd like to say that there is no cause that is worth the life of any man, but we know that is not true. We did not succeed in what we thought could have gone forward. There has not been-they are still working at it there, [ORG]. [CARDINAL] thing, also: We did a good job of training their military and equipping it. What we could not anticipate then was at the instigation of [GPE], on ethnic and religious bases, some of the elements of that trained army then refused to perform against the radical forces that the army had been trained to handle. But that does not change the need for us to continue in the Middle East overall with what must take place. And we hope if we can be helpful that we can bring about, and that is a meeting of the moderate [NORP] States and [GPE] and the bringing about of peace just as [GPE] and [GPE] brought about peace. If the circumstances were the same, but, hypothetically, we were back [DATE] and you were running against President [PERSON], would not you be hammering him for the death of the marines in [GPE]? For what? For the death of the marines in the [GPE] massacre. No, if I had all the knowledge that I presently have about the situation. There was one thing, whether it was campaigning or just making speeches in the past that I have always recognized, and that is that there are a number of areas in which only a President has the information, all the information, on a situation. And those who criticize are criticizing without having access to that same information. You'd better do [CARDINAL] more, if you can. Well, how about [CARDINAL] more? Be quick. Would you-a quick one-would you veto the bill requiring [FAC] to be moved from [GPE] to [GPE]? I am hoping I will not have to, but like the several previous Presidents before me, I think that that is a most unwise thing. It should never have been introduced in our [ORG]. The effort should never have been made, because if we are to have a negotiated peace that will end once and for all the literally-well, the hostility between the [NORP] world and [GPE], then that would be one of the things that must be negotiated. The place of [GPE], [GPE], things of this kind-these are all the matters that must be negotiated between these forces. And [GPE] has no right to put itself in a position of trying to lean [CARDINAL] way or the other on those areas for negotiation. Why do not -I'd like to ask the final question about Central America, [INTERVIEWED]. I wonder if I could ask you to explain or justify how [GPE] can go about assisting people who are, as you have called them, freedom fighters who are seeking to overthrow a government that we have diplomatic relations with, and answer, if you could, critics who are worried that this is increasing our involvement in Central America. Well, the answer to that is, first of all, this particular government of [GPE]'s is a government that was set up by force of arms. The people have never chosen it. It is a revolutionary government. And that government, in violation of its pledge to us at a time when it was a revolutionary force trying to become a government, had promised that it would not aid the guerrillas in [GPE], who are attempting to overthrow a duly elected government and a democratic government. And they have violated that. The guerrillas are literally being directed from bases near [GPE]. They are being supplied by that government. And the other factor with regard-and why I have referred to them on occasion as freedom fighters is because many of them are elements of the same revolution that put the [NORP] government in force. The revolution against the [NORP] dictatorship-and our government, under the previous administration, sat back and never lifted a finger in behalf of [PERSON] and then, when the fighting was over, did start to give financial aid to the revolutionary government to help it install itself-and had to cancel that when it discovered what that government was doing. During the revolution against [PERSON], the revolutionaries appealed to [ORG]-of which we are a member also-and appealed to that organization to ask [PERSON] to step down and end the bloodshed. And [ORG] asked for a statement of what were the goals of the revolution. And they were provided: democracy, a pluralistic government, free elections, free labor unions, freedom of the press, human rights observed-those were the goals of the revolution, submitted in writing to [ORG]. After they got in, they followed the pattern that was followed by [PERSON] in [GPE]. Those other elements 'that were not [NORP], other groups who wanted-and they thought all the same thing, democracy-to rid themselves of a dictatorship. Those elements were denied participation in the government. Arrests were made. There were some who were exiled. There were some, I am afraid, were executed. And many of the people now fighting as so-called contras are elements of the revolution. And it is less an overthrow that they are fighting for as it is a demand that they be allowed to participate in the government and that the government keep its promises as to what it had intended for the people. And I see no dichotomy in our supporting the Government, the democratic Government of [GPE], and the contras here. And we have made it plain to [GPE]-made it very plain that this will stop when they keep their promise and restore a democratic rule and have elections. Now, they have finally been pressured; the pressure's led to them saying they will have an election. I think they have scheduled it for [DATE]. But there is not anything yet to indicate that that election will be anything but the kind of rubber-stamp that we see in any totalitarian government. How do you have-there are not any rival candidates; there are not any rival parties. And how would they campaign without a free press? Well, that is a good note for us to close on. End on the free press. Thank you very much, [INTERVIEWED].", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingdeputynationalsecurityadvisorforinternationaleconomicaffairsmike", "text": "Yes, I heard [DATE] at lunch they were supposed to discuss growth and perspective of growth. But then [PERSON] came in and started to sort of discuss the formats of the [ORG], [ORG], and the whole discussion has been derailed. And the President intervened. So can you tell us a bit more about that and what was the sense of that discussion? The [ORG]-plus-5-plus-1, as you know, started [TIME] [TIME] They met for [TIME], and then they continued meeting over lunch. The agenda included the global economy and restoring growth. Also the future growth model and where growth is going to come from coming out of the recovery. There was a discussion of development issues, as well as of climate change, even though obviously the full discussion was to be had in [ORG], and other topics also came up, including, as you said, the nature of the format of global governance, with a discussion of the [ORG], the [ORG]-plus-5-plus-1, the [ORG], and what respective roles and contributions they make to global governance. I would not say they derailed the conversation at all; it was all part of an ongoing discussion about how best to deal with these global issues, and there was a good interchange on that issue. And what came out of it? There was no -- there was no particular conclusion about it. I think different leaders share different perspectives about it. And I'd say if you -- if there was a sense of the room, it was that we would continue to discuss what sort of architectural evolution the global governance might go through. Do you get the feeling that -- in [ORG], do you get the feeling that it is time to move beyond the [ORG]? Yes, I think -- I think our feeling is, is that whenever leaders get together, they can accomplish important things, and that our most precious resource and our most scarce resource is our leaders' time. And so whenever they get together, in whatever format -- whether it is bilaterally, plural-laterally, as [CARDINAL], as [CARDINAL], as [CARDINAL] -- that we should use those opportunities to advance the global agenda. There is no [CARDINAL] perfect format for all issues. There was a -- we talked about [DATE], or on the call [TIME], there was a very good, robust discussion among the [CARDINAL] on various national security and foreign policy issues. There were good discussions on the economy, among the [CARDINAL], among the [CARDINAL]; as well as trade with the other [CARDINAL] members of [ORG] also joining. So at some point you had [CARDINAL] -- or excuse me, [CARDINAL] in the room discussing trade and discussing climate. So there is no [CARDINAL] perfect format. I think at this point we take advantage of whatever formats are available to try and advance the global agenda. Thanks. [INTERVIEWED1] or [INTERVIEWED2], could you give us some color about the President's role at the [ORG] meeting [DATE] -- whether he -- where he , what actual effect he had on the final result? And I will repeat a question that I asked at the earlier briefing, which was, the President had said he wants [GPE] to show leadership on climate change. Did he achieve that ? I think he certainly achieved that. I think that there is wide recognition and wide appreciation, actually, of the role of [GPE] and the change that the President has brought in [GPE] policy on this issue, which has been more dramatic perhaps than in any other area. I think it was a very -- I think it was a good exchange, a good actual meeting and discussion among leaders. The President certainly ran it. He started with a strong opening statement that ran through a whole kind of set of issues that included what [GPE] is doing, that included some vision of where this thing ought to go, and the varying pressures and stresses that come on countries that are both on the developed and developing countries side and what we need to do together to get a result. So I think that there were I think very strong interventions by both President [PERSON] from [GPE], Prime Minister [PERSON]. Both had quite interesting statements and suggestions, proposals, with respect to financing. Prime Minister [PERSON] had very strong intervention, again calling on countries to get beyond what has held us up up until now, recognizing the differences, recognizing different circumstances. These are very tough issues and countries do come at them from very different perspectives, but we cannot get a solution unless there is some coming together. I think that Prime Minister [PERSON] had a very strong statement to make in that regard. And there were statements from all around the room. It was not a tour democratically elected table -- everybody-read-their-talking-points kind of deal. It was a discussion and I think it was quite useful. On trade, [INTERVIEWED1], would you say this promise to restart [GPE] in [DATE], is that a reflection of the economic and political realities of the global crisis? Is that something that the President -- President [PERSON] supports, or was there any effort by anyone to try to see if it could get on track earlier than that? Well, I think -- first of all, the President supports it, it is part of the joint statement that the [GPE] signed on to. And so we certainly support it. I think it is a reflection, frankly, of the pragmatic fact that it takes a while to complete these rounds. For those who follow it, know that there is been some progress -- there is been significant progress on agricultural subsidies, that there is been discussion of agricultural and manufactured market access -- but that is , in fact, exactly the area of focus of this statement, of how to get those discussions to the next level, where there will be more transparency over what countries are going to do on market access. The negotiations over services has not really begun yet. There is a negotiation of rules to be had and environmental product. So there is still a lot of work to do between now and the conclusion of a balanced, ambitious [GPE] agreement. And the significance of this statement was to try and break the deadlock that has plagued the [GPE] Round for [DATE] and try and get beyond the deadlock and focus on what -- making sure there is meaningful market access to create an ambitious agreement. when it comes to the way the process the President's remarks that anxiety about the global economic situation should not inhibit or deter either [GPE] or other member nations from pursuing global climate change legislation to deal with carbon pollution. Why should not it? The ordinary [NORP] taxpayer may say, wait [TIME], is this really the right time to impose a cap and trade system, to place a new tax on carbon when the [GPE] economy is struggling to get out of the deepest recession since the Great Depression? I mean, can you address that, why there should not even be some anxiety about that and that should not at least in some way influence the debate about this issue? Sure. Sure. It is understandable that there is some anxiety about it, but there is a couple of points to be made and the President has made these points I think on many occasions. First of all, the nature of the problem is such that you cannot wait. I mean, the status quo is not a sustainable thing. But secondly, there is -- you could put it aside, pretend that you can wait for some number of years, continue to lock in investment in high-carbon technology -- or you can take steps to build the kind of economy that is going to be sustainable, that is going to build a plant and equipment that is going to be able to last. It is the right economic move to make. If you do not make this you are going to end up spending more money [DATE] down the road. So there is no point in having a huge, big stimulus effort which simply locks in old technology, locks in a high-carbon path -- which is completely unsustainable; science, unfortunately, is undoubtedly just going to get worse on this issue, not better -- and the plain reality, this is absolutely compellingly true for countries like [GPE] and [GPE] and everywhere else, as well as that the high carbon cap is simply untenable. And you are going to suffer economically -- not just in the environment -- you are going to suffer economically if you choose that path, because in not very many years, if it looks bad now it is going to look worse and it is going to be completely untenable. So the President is making the right choice, and it is the right choice to move forward on this now, even though the anxiety people feel is quite understandable. [INTERVIEWED1], did the anxiety come up in the conversations? Did any of the member nations wonder aloud if this is really the right time, if another time, a better economic scenario might be wiser? I think the only instance in which it came up was a recognition that the challenge that the global community faces would be difficult under any circumstance. In the current economic circumstance, it is challenging, but that it is equally urgent. And as [PERSON] said, it is not something that can be wait -- that can wait and just be put off for [DATE]. And I would just -- I just want to underscore [CARDINAL] thing that [PERSON] said earlier -- and, again, I hope you all have the fact sheet. The [CARDINAL] specifics in the mitigation paragraph that were agreed to by developed and developing countries are really quite significant steps forward and quite significant contributions to the [ORG] negotiations. It is not the end of the line. As [PERSON] said, there is still negotiations to be had, there is still numbers to fill in. But those are things that have been agreed to for the first time by developing and developed countries alike, and really make a meaningful contribution towards the resolution of this issue. There seemed to me, reading this, a slight difference between the way the President characterized what the developing countries were committing to do by [GPE] -- I may have this wrong -- in terms of actually establishing concrete goals for themselves, towards this recognition that [PERCENT] Celsius is the max that we should have global growth -- warming. So that is my question. What are the developing countries saying here they will do [DATE] that would be binding on them in the way of goals, targets, and ? What the developing countries have -- the critical thing the developing countries have said, which they have not said before, is that in the midterm -- that is roughly [DATE], that kind of time frame -- that they are going to undertake actions promptly that would result in meaningful reductions as compared to their business as usual. Look, these are all principles that are getting articulated, so none of this is exactly binding on either side right now. But it sets up measures that would go into an ultimate agreement. They have never done that. That is a quite significant undertaking. By the way, they have never acknowledged the [CARDINAL] degrees, either, which is also quite significant. I mean, it is true that we do not yet have an agreement on [PERCENT] by [DATE], but [CARDINAL] degrees is the underpinning for that. It is very significant that they have accepted that and that they have accepted essentially a process to try to actually work out a [DATE] number in the [GPE] time frame. But the [CARDINAL] degrees and the meaningful reduction and deviations from business as usual -- very, very significant, and yes, as [INTERVIEWED1] was just was saying -- and the concept of a peak here. I mean, they have never agreed to any of those things. Those are all quite significant and meaningful. [INTERVIEWER]. Just a couple of questions. [CARDINAL], did the President feel it is important to talk about how [GPE] in the past has not fulfilled its obligations, and if so, why? And he also praised some countries for coming up with innovative ways to combat climate change during the meeting, and I was wondering if you could elaborate on those ways at all. I did not hear the second part of the question. -- praised some countries for -- Praised some countries for coming up with -- [GPE] and -- For financing -- Oh, yes, yes, okay, [GPE]. I am tired, obviously. What was the first part of the question? The first part is why was it important to the President to talk about -- that [GPE] has not always fulfilled its obligations? Well, look, I think that it is important for [GPE] to recognize where it has fallen short. Clearly we have an historic responsibility with respect to the emissions that are already up there in the atmosphere. It is a point that Prime Minster [PERSON] made, as well. Actually, Prime Minister [PERSON] also echoed the point that over the space of [DATE] of [DATE] up until, you know, just in [DATE], [GPE] was basically not in the game and [GPE] was not in the game. And I think it is valuable to recognize when you have come up short, but also to underscore, which the President did very strongly, that it is [DATE] now. I mean, as he said, [DATE] are over, and that is exactly right. So, no, I think it is useful to recognize both sides of the situation. As I said, he commended both [GPE] and the [GPE], who have come forward in different ways. [GPE] has got something called a Green Fund proposal, which is interesting and innovative, and Prime Minister [PERSON] made a speech [DATE] where he puts some new financing ideas on the table. And I think the President was both commending those and encouraging more of that kind of thinking. All right, thank you very much. I know we are trying to get this wrapped up so people can leave at the [TIME] buses. Hey, [INTERVIEWED1], just real quick, is there going to be a statement about the bilat with [PERSON], or -- There will be actually in [TIME] a short release. A short release? Yes. Okay, thanks. And that should be it for [TIME], so hopefully everybody will get a chance to get down to [GPE] and maybe relax a little bit. Thanks.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithstevekroftcbs60minutes1", "text": "As [INTERVIEWED1] approaches [DATE] in [FAC], some of the public's enthusiasm for his ambitious agenda at home and abroad is on the wane. While he helped avert a worldwide financial collapse and may well achieve his goal of health- care reform during [DATE] in office, the [GPE] economy is still very weak with double-digit unemployment. And his approval ratings are at the lowest point of his presidency. [DATE] before he left for Europe to accept the Nobel Peace Prize, we sat down with the [INTERVIEWER1 in [FAC] at [FAC] for a wide-ranging discussion, much of it focused on his decision to send an additional [CARDINAL] 000 troops to [GPE]. Was that the most difficult decision of your presidency so far? Absolutely. Why? Because when you go to [ORG] and you travel to [GPE] and you visit [GPE] and you see the sacrifices that young men and women and their families are making, there is nothing more profound. And it is a solemn obligation on the part of me as commander in chief to get those decisions right. I do not make this decision lightly. In your [FAC] speech, you seemed very analytical, detached, not emotional. The tone seemed to be, I have studied the situation very hard, it is a real mess, the options are not very good, but we need to go ahead and do this. There were no exhortations or promises of victory. Why? Why that tone? You know, that was actually probably the most emotional speech that I have made in terms of how I felt about it, because I was looking out over a group of cadets, some of whom are going to be deployed in [GPE], and potentially some might not come back. There is not a speech that I have made that hit me in the gut as much as that speech. And one of the mistakes that was made over [DATE] is for us to have a triumphant sense about war. There was a tendency to say, we can go in, we can kick some tail, this is some glorious exercise, when in fact this is a tough business. Most [NORP] right now do not believe this war is worth fighting. And most of the people in your party do not believe this is a war worth fighting. Right. Why did you go ahead? Because I think it is the right thing to do, and that is my job. If I was worrying about what polled well, there are a whole bunch of things we would not have done [DATE]. Do you feel like you have staked your presidency on it? There are a whole bunch of things that I have staked my presidency on, right, that are tough and entail some risks, there are no guarantees, but that I am confident we have addressed in the best possible way. The [FAC] speech was greeted with a great deal of confusion. I disagree with that statement. You do. I absolutely do. [CARDINAL] people watched it, and I think a whole bunch of people understood what we intend to do. Well, it raised a lot of questions. And some people thought it was contradictory. That is a fair criticism. I do not think it is a fair criticism. I think that what you may be referring to is the fact that, on the [CARDINAL] hand, I said, we are going to be sending in additional troops now. On the other hand, by [DATE], we are going to move into a transition phase where we are drawing our troops down. There should not be anything confusing about that. First of all, that is something that we executed over [DATE] in [GPE], so I think the [NORP] people are familiar with the idea of a surge. In terms of the rationale for doing it, we do not have an [NORP] military right now, a security force, that can stabilize the country. If we are effective over [DATE], that then frees us up to transition into a place where we can start drawing down. Now, the other point of confusion I think that at least the press has identified is this notion of, well, what happens on [DATE]? Right. What does happen? And what I have said is that we then start transitioning into a drawdown phase. How many [GPE] troops are coming out, how quickly, will be determined by conditions on the ground. So if the situation is not going well in [DATE], you could decide -- and I am not making light of this -- to send home the band and a couple of [ORG] units and nonessential units and keep as many combat people on the ground as are necessary to perform the mission? Well, look, as commander in chief, obviously I reserve the option to do what I think is going to be best for the [NORP] people at that point in time and our national security. But we will know, I think, by [DATE] whether or not the approach that General [PERSON] has discussed in terms of securing population centers is meeting its objectives. And if the approach that is been recommended does not work, then, yes, we are going to be changing approaches. Why set a deadline? I mean, Senator [PERSON], most prominently -- And the answer is that, in the absence of a deadline, the message we are sending to the [NORP] is, it is business as usual, this is an open-ended commitment. And very frankly, there are, I think, elements in [GPE], who would be perfectly satisfied to make [GPE] a permanent protectorate of [GPE], in which they carry no burden, in which we are paying for a military in [GPE] that preserves their security and their prerogatives. That is not what the [NORP] people signed on for when they went into [GPE] in [DATE]. They signed up to go after [ORG]. The main reason we are doing this is [ORG]. Why send [CARDINAL] troops to [GPE]? Because according to your government's own estimates, there are maybe [CARDINAL] [ORG] fighters in [GPE], that the rest are in [GPE] and the tribal territories. What you have here between the borders of [GPE] and [GPE] is the epicenter of violent extremism directed against the West and directed against [GPE]. This is the heart of it. This is where [PERSON] is. This is where its allies are. It is from here that you see attacks launched, not just against [GPE], but against [GPE], against [GPE], against a whole host of countries. And [CARDINAL] of this territory is in [GPE]. [CARDINAL] of this territory is in [GPE], [CARDINAL] of it is in [GPE]. Ultimately, in order for us to eradicate the problem, to really go after [ORG] in an effective way, we are going to need more cooperation from [GPE]. There is no doubt about that. You are a student of history. The [NORP] lost the Revolutionary War, and the [NORP] lost the Vietnam War, in spite of the fact that they won almost all of the major battles. They lost it because it got to be too expensive, it was too far away, and not enough people cared about it. Are not you facing some of those same problems right now? I think what is true is that if we have an open-ended commitment in a place like [GPE], with no clear benchmarks for what success means, that the [NORP] people, who have just gone through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, who have already endured [DATE] of war, at some point are going to say, enough, and rightly so. In [GPE], I mean, you can make the argument that it is not even really a country, that it is a collection of tribes, and it is run really by a very corrupt government, some of whose major figures are alleged to be involved in the drug business, including the brother of [INTERVIEWER1. How are you going to deal with this? Look -- How are you going to do this? Look, [INTERVIEWER1, I mean, the reason I laugh is because this is really hard, and there is not a question you ask that I have not asked in meetings and that I do not ask myself. I do not have the luxury of choosing between the ideal and what exists on the ground. I have to make decisions based on how, given where we are right now, how do we get to the best possible place. Okay, let us change the subject. Okay, why not? Jobs. We can talk about [GPE] some more. [INTERVIEWER1's frustration is understandable. While the economy is showing signs of growth and job losses may finally be bottoming out, the unemployment rate is still at [PERCENT]. [DATE], he outlined a new jobs program built around tax breaks for small businesses, more infrastructure projects for local and state governments and cash rebates for people to make their homes more energy efficient. What I am interested in is a targeted jobs package that can help to boost what is already taking place. Companies are already starting to hire again. Is there a way to boost their confidence? And I think there is. The [INTERVIEWER1 hopes to subsidize the job program and pay down some of the deficit with [MONEY] being returned to the government under the TARP program. Some Wall Street banks have now recovered to the point where they can not only afford to pay back the loans, but once again hand out huge bonuses to their employees. At [CARDINAL] of the biggest banks, they are expected to total [MONEY]. That is roughly what it will cost the government to finance the surge in [GPE]. And [INTERVIEWER1 is furious. I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of, you know, fat-cat bankers on Wall Street. The only ones that are going to be paying out these fat bonuses are the ones that have now paid back that [ORG] money and are -- Do you think that is why they paid it back so quickly? I think, in some cases, that was a motivation, which I think tells me that the people on Wall Street still do not get it. They do not get it. They are still puzzled, why is it that people are mad at the banks? Well, let us see. You know, you guys are drawing down [MONEY] bonuses after [GPE] went through [DATE] that it is gone through in [DATE], and you guys caused the problem, and we have got [PERCENT] unemployment? Why do you think people might be a little frustrated? Do you think that they have made some of these bonuses based, in part, on the generosity and policies of the [GPE] government to help put the financial system back on its feet? I think there is no doubt about it. And what is most frustrating me right now is you have got these same banks, who benefited from taxpayer assistance, who are fighting tooth and nail with their lobbyists up on [ORG], fighting against financial regulatory reform. Why is it taking so long? Well, everything appears to take long in [ORG]. We can talk about health care when you want. This is democracy in action. You mentioned [ORG] and health care. You ran for office based on the fact that you were going to try and reform the system. You wanted to change the status quo in [GPE]. Then you came in and you turned over your top priority, health care, to the [ORG]. That is not true. [CARDINAL] -- well, you laid out what you wanted, and you set the guidelines -- Right, exactly. -- and then stood back and turned it over to [CARDINAL] people, who produced a [CARDINAL]-page bill that is -- What? Well, I have not read it so -- Finish your thought, [INTERVIEWER1. -- I cannot really -- I'd say, some people think is incomprehensible. Not very many people have read it. I have not met anybody who is read it. [INTERVIEWER1, look, look, let us be clear here. [CARDINAL] presidents have tried to reform a health-care system that everyone acknowledges is broken. [CARDINAL] presidents have failed, up until this point. We are now that close to having a bill that does all the things that I said and most experts said needed to be done when we started this process. It is not only deficit-neutral but will actually bring down the deficit, according to [ORG]. You think it is going to pass. Yes. Do you think it is going to pass before [DATE] in the [ORG]? I think it is going to pass out of the [ORG] before [DATE]. Are you going to be involved in that process? I have been involved the whole time. At that point, we thought the interview was over, and then our executive producer suggested [CARDINAL] more question. The gate crashers -- Yeah. By now, you must know that -- It is really a shame that I had to go through a whole [ORG] interview without talking about the gate crashers. Good catch. You must know -- you must know what happened. Can you share that with us? I think that what I know is what everybody knows, which is that these people should not have gotten through the gate. Were you unhappy with your social secretary? I was unhappy with everybody who was involved in the process. So it was a screw-up. Now, I do not think that, from a policy perspective, this was the most important thing or even the fifth or sixth most important thing that happened [DATE], although it got the most news. Were you angry when you found out about it? Yes. That is why I -- Seriously angry, correct? Yes. That is why it will not happen again.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithalahraminternational", "text": "I have learned that President [PERSON] sent you, recently, [CARDINAL] important messages. I do not know, I mean, the contents of these messages, but I assume that of course it be linked by the situation in [GPE] and [GPE]. I would like to ask, in the beginning, [CARDINAL] general question about how do you look at this vision of the Middle East. Well, first of all, I communicate with President [PERSON] a lot, because I value his judgment, and we have got a frank relationship where if he thinks things are going badly, he will tell me. In other words, he does not gloss over. I think that things in the Middle East for [GPE] are difficult right now. I think they are difficult because people do not really understand our intentions. I think they are difficult because some people ascribe bad values and bad motives to the [NORP] people and [ORG]. Our intentions are to work for free societies and peaceful societies. Our intentions are to protect our own security, on the [CARDINAL] hand, but also enable people to live in peace. Obviously, our reputation has been damaged severely by the terrible and horrible acts, inhumane acts that were conducted on [NORP] prisoners. [DATE] I cannot tell you how sorry I am to them and their families for the humiliation. I am also sorry because people are then able to say, Look how terrible [GPE] is. But this is not [GPE]. That is not- [NORP] are appalled at what happened. We are a generous people. I do not think a lot of people understand that, so I have got to do a better job of explaining to people that we are for a lot of things that most people who live in the Middle East want. We want there to be peace. We want people to have a living. We want people to send their kids to schools that work. We want there to be health care. We want there to be a [NORP] state at peace with its neighbors. We want there to be reform. We want people to have a chance to participate in the process. But I'd say right now times are tough for [GPE] and the Middle East. I have [CARDINAL] topics, [GPE], the [NORP]-Arab issue, the so-called greater Middle East, and bilateral-which one do you choose of them, [INTERVIEWED1]? Whatever you want to do, sir. You are the distinguished journalist. Thank you very much, indeed. Okay, I will shoot for the [NORP]-Israeli conflict. Okay. Many [NORP] feel that after the letter of assurances you gave to [NORP] Prime Minister [PERSON], any future [NORP] state would exist on [CARDINAL] what the partition plan offered them in [DATE]. How do you reconcile this with a moral concept of justice? First of all, I made it very clear in my letter that I recognized circumstances had changed, but I made it very clear of a couple of very important points: [CARDINAL], that any final status would be negotiated by the parties-that would be the [NORP] and the [NORP]-not [GPE]. We will not prejudge final status. Secondly, I made it clear that I supported what the Prime Minister had done, because I think it is a great opportunity for the establishment of a [NORP] state. I am the first President ever to have articulated the vision of a [NORP] state. I am writing here, and I wanted to appreciate that very highly. Well, I will tell you, and I am somewhat amazed, sir, that the debate has already started about what the end results are going to look like, when we have not even really begun yet to establish a state. I think the focus ought to be on putting the institutions in place for a [NORP] state that is peaceful and prosperous to emerge. I think it is very important for reform-minded [NORP] to step up and ask the world for help in order to build the security apparatus needed for a state to grow; ask for education help; ask for help to stimulate the entrepreneurial class so businesses will grow. I believe it'll happen. And when it does happen, the final status issues will be much easier to solve. In other words, when there is a state that is up and running and prosperous and has the confidence of [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] and the [ORG] and the rest of the world, it'll be much easier for these final- these tricky issues to be solved between the [CARDINAL] parties. And so now is the time not to be arguing over what the world will look like down the road. We ought to be arguing about what the world can look like [DATE]. And that is why the roadmap is so important. [GPE] is firmly committed to the roadmap. I am sending a letter to the-I announced [DATE] I am going to send a letter to the [NORP] Prime Minister explaining that I am committed to the road-map, committed to [CARDINAL] states living side by side in peace, but also reminding him it is now time to step up and show leadership, show leadership against the terrorists and show leadership in putting the institutions in place for a state to emerge. The right of [NORP] refugees to return to their homeland and to be provided with compensation is legally assured in several [ORG] resolutions. Right. [GPE] has also traditionally supported the right of refugees to return in recent major conflicts. How would you then justify making the [NORP] refugees an exception for accepted international laws under human rights conventions? My comment, again, was this, that-and the right of refugees is a final status issue. And that is to be negotiated on between the [NORP] and the [NORP]. When I said what has changed and what will change is when there is a [NORP] state to which [NORP] can go. There has not been one. And my point was, was that when a state is set up and the institutions are in place and people have a chance to make a living and it is peaceful, the entrepreneurial class is growing, small businesses, people are participating in the political process, that that is going to change the dynamic on the ground. I fully concede there is a lot-the compensation issue is an issue that is still being negotiated. The rights of-you know, the rights of [NORP] to return to [GPE] will be negotiated, but what I am telling you is when a state emerges, it'll change the dynamic. And that is all I said in my comment. Again, I will repeat to you, people want to focus on the future, when I think we ought to be focused right now on the right now, which is what is necessary to put a [NORP] state in place so people can have a chance to live in a hopeful society. And I am frustrated, I must tell you, a little bit, because I think that there needs to be better leadership in saying, What can we do to help the [NORP] people develop a state? And there needs to be a new constitution, it seems like to me. And some of these reforms stalled. Heck, we have been talking about them for [DATE], unfortunately, but now is an opportunity. And I think Prime Minister [PERSON] created an interesting dynamic, I really do, and that is withdrawal from [GPE]. You know, it was not all that long ago if an [NORP] Prime Minister stood up and said, We are out of [GPE] and parts of [GPE], people would have said, That is fantastic. And so the Prime Minister makes the decision to get out and, of course, his own party rejects it, which speaks to-it speaks to his leadership, in my judgment, that he is willing to do what he thinks is right, in face of political opposition. But do you really agree that pragmatic realities mean annexation of other lands? Do I think-- Do you agree on that, I mean, that pragmatic realities which, I mean, being said repeatedly here in the [GPE], pragmatic realities-pragmatic realities... You mean, with the conditions on the ground? Does it mean annexation of other people's land? I think what it means is, I think you are going to see over time with the emergence of a [NORP] state that [GPE] will be occupied by [NORP]. And to the extent to what the final border looks like is up for negotiations. Again, we very much appreciate the fact that you were the first [GPE] President to call for the creation of an independent [NORP] state. But in all the recent proposals that are being circulated, including the latest disengagement plan, we did not see any specific timetable. What happened to your pledge to create a [NORP] state by [DATE]? And do you still believe that this could be possible? Well, [DATE] may be hard, since [DATE] is right around the corner. I readily concede the date has slipped some, primarily because violence sprung up. When I laid out the date of [DATE], I believe it was around the time I went to [GPE], [GPE]. It was a very meaningful moment, where former Prime Minister [PERSON], myself, Prime Minister [PERSON], and His Majesty, [PERSON], stood up and pledged to work together. But we hit a bump in the road-violence, as well as [PERSON] was replaced, which changed the dynamic. I do not want to make any excuses, but nevertheless I think the timetable of [DATE] is not as realistic as it was [DATE]. Nevertheless, I do think we ought to push hard as fast as possible to get a state in place. And I repeat to you, sir, that part of my frustrations were alleviated with the [ORG] making the statement it made [DATE]-the [ORG] being the [ORG], [GPE], [ORG], and [GPE], working together. I think we can get [ORG] involved. But there is a certain sense of responsibility that falls upon the [NORP], reform-minded [NORP] to step up and say, Yes, we accept these institutions necessary for a peaceful state to emerge. There is also a responsibility for [GPE]. [GPE] has got, in my judgment, an important role to play to help make sure there is security in [GPE] as the civil structure is put in place and as the Government structure is put in place. And President [PERSON], I think, is willing to assume that responsibility over time. I do not want to put him on a timetable, but I do believe he is committed to helping bring security to that part of the world. It is in [GPE]'s interest that there be security. You know, [INTERVIEWED1], we did our best, I mean, getting all the factions together in [GPE], [GPE], to try to convince them to have [CARDINAL] single opinion and that we are ready for training the police and security guards. That is right. President [PERSON] has been a leader on the issue of security. He really has. As you say, he is convened a very important meeting to make it clear that in order for there to be a peaceful evolution of a state, there has to be security, and that he is willing to train police. [GPE] plays a mighty important role. And it is a great country, and it should play an important role. You have said, [INTERVIEWED1], in recent statements that the assurances you gave to [PERSON] did not differ from what was being discussed and what we mentioned now and previous final status talks. But in those talks there were proposals on land swaps and an [NORP] acceptance for the return of a limited number of refugees. Why were these proposals absent from your recent letters? Look, I want to assure you once again that I understand the sensitivity of these final status issues. But they will be negotiated, not between [GPE] and the parties; they are negotiated between [GPE] and the [NORP] Government of a new state. And that is really- and that is a position I have taken all along. It is what I told my friend President [PERSON]. I just told that to His Majesty, [PERSON]. And I will explain that consistent position of mine. People-I think some people are trying to read something into what I said or did not say. And what-you know, I will say it finally [CARDINAL] more time: This is an opportunity that we cannot let go by. There is a lot of argument about final status issues, and they are very important issues, do not get me wrong. But the focus ought to be on how do we get a [NORP] state up and running and moving forward. You have praised [PERSON]'s proposal to withdraw from [GPE], which is an idea that does not represent [PERCENT] of-[inaudible]-Palestine. Would you accept guarantee for granting [NORP] similar letter of assurances stating that any annexation of [GPE] territory has to be minimal and that [GPE] has to pull out from nearly the entire [GPE], according to Security Resolution 242 and 338? No, I will write-I will say the exact same thing in a letter to the [NORP] that I have said publicly [DATE], that I believe an opportunity exists, and it is essential that [ORG] find reform-minded leaders who are willing to step up and lead. The last question on [NORP]-Arab issue. You have repeatedly-repeatedly stated that [GPE] had the right to defend itself. But do you believe that by building walls and settlements and by assassinating [NORP] leaders, [GPE] is enhancing security and helping and reassuring peace talks? I think that any country has a right to defend herself. And you are looking at a President who is now in the process of defending my country against terrorist attacks. It is very difficult for the President of [GPE] to condemn anybody for defending themselves. My problem with the wall was not the security aspect of the wall. My problem with the wall was that at [CARDINAL] point in time, it looked like it was trying to prejudge any final status, and that I hope-my hope is, at [CARDINAL] point in time, the wall is unnecessary. The hope is, is that a peaceful [NORP] state, that-I keep saying that, but I think it is possible-but a peaceful [NORP] state must be a state in which youngsters are well educated and have a chance to make a living and have a chance to- parents have a chance to realize-raise their children in a peaceful setting. And I think that a peaceful [NORP] state will eventually change the dynamics on that which exists on the ground [DATE]. Okay. I thank you very much for your patience. I will move to the other topic, [GPE]. Sure. Sure. You said [DATE] that you first learned of the abuses of [FAC] and other prison-and other prisons in [GPE] generally. Why has it taken so long to adopt serious measures against those directly responsible and their commanders? First of all, I learned about the fact that there was an investigation going on. I did not know the extent of the abuse. And there was a report done as a result of those investigations, and what you are hearing here in [GPE] is, why did not I see the report? And that is a good question. That is one of the questions I am asking, because I first saw about the pictures on television screens. But [CARDINAL] of the things you have got to understand about our country is that, [CARDINAL], we reject this kind of treatment of people. It is abhorrent, and it is not [GPE]. Your viewers have to understand, this is not our country. Secondly, that we will fully investigate. Now, there is a difference between fully investigating and rushing to judgment. We will investigate, and there is a procedure in the military that is necessary to make sure that the guilty are truly guilty. It is very important for the Commander in Chief not to prejudge. Thirdly, the process will be transparent. Your viewers have got to know that here in [GPE], in our system, the judicial process will be fully transparent, and you are beginning to see the transparency. The press corps wants to know different questions, and those questions need to be answered. [DATE] our Secretary of [ORG], in whom I have got confidence and believe in, will go up and testify at [ORG] [ORG]. So you will see the process evolve as to-and the truth come out as to why the military needed to take the time necessary to fully investigate these horrible, horrible acts. And I repeat to you, sir, I am sorry for the humiliation suffered by those individuals. It makes me sick to my stomach to see that happen. I will tell you what else I am sorry about. I am sorry that the truth about our soldiers in [GPE] becomes obscured. In other words, we have got fantastic citizens in [GPE], good kids, good soldiers, men and women who are working [DATE] to make [NORP] citizens' lives better. And there are [CARDINAL] acts of kindness that take place [DATE] of these great [NORP] who really do care about the citizens in [GPE]. It is an awful, awful period for the [NORP] people, just like it is awful for the [NORP] citizens to see that on their TV screens. Again, sir, do you feel like you need to apologize to the [NORP] and the [NORP] world after you said that, I am sorry ? Well, I am sorry for the prisoners. I really am. I think it is humiliating, and it is, again-what the [NORP] world must understand is a couple of things. [CARDINAL], under a dictatorship, these- this would not be transparent. In other words, if there was torture under a dictator, we would never know the truth. In a democracy, you will know the truth, and justice will be done. And that is what people need to know. What are the main pillars of the upcoming [ORG] resolution on [GPE]? How much control are you ready to cede to [ORG] and the future [NORP] Government? Well, I think [ORG] wants the sovereignty. And I think that is the proper-the proper relationship is for the [NORP]-the sovereignty to be passed to [ORG] with help from coalition as well as [ORG]. I will tell you, a very good role for [ORG] is to help set up the elections that will take place in [DATE]. And the [ORG] resolution is important, because it says to members of the world, please participate in helping this Government grow. But the sovereignty-Iraqi people want to run the Government themselves. That is not to say they do not want help. Of course they want help. But they want to run their Government. Frankly, you hear frustrations about [GPE] there in [GPE]. And I can understand that, because the [GPE]-nobody wants their Government run for them. The people of [GPE] want to run their own Government, and that is what will happen. How long do you think [GPE] will stay in [GPE]? As long as necessary, and not [DATE] more. A recent [ORG] Poll showed that [PERCENT] of [NORP] considered [GPE] an occupying power. Does this disappoint you? No, listen, I understand. I mean, if I were an [NORP] and I saw people-was asked, am I happy that somebody is running my Government for me, which basically is what the question implies, the answer would be, No, we want to run our Government ourselves. And that is why we are transferring sovereignty. I will tell you, however, the [NORP] people understand that [GPE] needs to be around for a while to help make sure that the killers-the foreign fighters who are there, disgruntled former Saddamists- do not wreak havoc. There are [CARDINAL] of [NORP] losing their lives at the hands of these killers. And they are-and they need help right now, until security-Iraqi security forces are efficient, are formed in a way that will be able to be responsive to the dangers of these few people. It is essential that there be a secure environment as [GPE] emerges from this period of tyranny, and they want our help there. They also want the reconstruction aid. And it has been delayed a lot. Well, it has, for a reason. Early in [DATE] there was fast movement on the reconstruction projects. I mean, there is some wonderful things that have happened in [GPE], which of course do not get mentioned very often. For example, I will tell you an interesting thing that is happened, is that the currency, the old currency was replaced by a new currency in [DATE] period of time. That is hard to do. And yet, it was done without a lot of arbitrage, a lot of counterfeiting, theft. There was no theft, and the currency is stable, which is a remarkable feat, when you think about it. The electricity levels were climbing quite dramatically. The oil production, which is [NORP] oil production, it is not [NORP], it is -Iraq owns the oil-it is up to [QUANTITY] a day. So in other words, there were positive signs going on. And then we had this period of fighting, where elements in society decided to fight because they saw freedom coming and they wanted to try and stop it, is what they are trying to do. And we took them on and are defeating them. What is happening now is that big projects are starting back up again because the security situation is a little better, and big companies are moving in with these reconstruction projects. It will start back up, and [GPE] will be better for it. I am aware of a very emotional meeting that took place recently between you and the [NORP] women delegation-- Yes. --and met you there with lots of tears. Yes, there were. Do you care to share the details of that meeting with us? Only because you asked. I did have the honor of welcoming a group of women to [FAC]. I was told ahead of time that some members of the delegation did not want to come in [FAC] because they did not want to get their picture taken, because they were afraid, not of [NORP] reaction but of reaction back home. In other words, there is still fear in people's heart. I met with those ladies later. The door opened to [FAC], and the first woman that walked in looked at me, and she burst out in tears and said, You are my liberator. It touched my heart. It really did. And I, of course-I held her in my arms and tears came to my eyes as she cried out of joy. It really made me feel great. She said, Thank you, [INTERVIEWED1]. You liberated us. I said, No, the [NORP] people helped liberate you. And then another lady came in, and another lady came in. We had [CARDINAL] of us in our office. And it was a touching meeting. These were people that were obviously somewhat taken aback that they were in with the President of [GPE]. And yet, when they were with me, it was deeply emotional. It touched my heart. I still remember it clearly [DATE]. It made me very joyous inside to think that people who had been enslaved to tyranny, fearful of torture, probably had friends in mass graves, would be so thankful for the chance to live in peace. And I will tell you what is really important for the people-those people, those women, and I think about them all the time, is for me to never show any weakness in the face of the dangers in [GPE]. In other words, those killers want us to leave. But my attitude is, having met with these women, if we leave, they will be in jeopardy. And I have an obligation, no matter how difficult it gets, to stay strong on behalf of those women and their chance to raise their children in freedom. [DATE] I had [ORG] from [GPE] come, [CARDINAL] members of [ORG]. It was an exciting moment. I love sports, for starters, and the head of the women's [ORG] came. She was a former runner. And she told me about her [DATE] son and [DATE] son. She had quit the Olympic team because she did not want to run for [CARDINAL] of [PERSON]'s sons, for fear of her life, and yet she was so grateful for the freedom she has. It is heartening. I met with Fulbright Scholars, young [NORP] that are here studying in [GPE]. I met with doctors from [GPE] who are getting new training, all of whom are desperate for there to be a free society so they can live in peace, and that is why we share the same goal. On greater Middle East, [INTERVIEWED1], has your vision on the greater Middle East initiative changed at all in light of recent reactions from [NORP] and [NORP] countries? What will be presented to the [ORG] leaders in their meeting [DATE]? My vision for the greater Middle East reforms were strengthened by [ORG]. You might have heard of that. [Laughter] I saw the spirit of that conference. There are people in the Middle East who understand the need for reforms. Now, when I talk about reforms, I fully understand the pace of reform will be different from country to country. But nevertheless, there has to be a commitment to reform for a better life for every citizen. I am as strong [DATE] on reforms in the greater Middle East as I have ever been. I fully understand criticism. I mean, I get criticized all the time in my job. I think the job of a leader is to have a vision, a vision that is hopeful and optimistic and one based upon certain principles, a principle like rule of law, a principle like human dignity by empowering individuals to make decisions in the political process, a principle that every person deserves respect, a principle that says that a peaceful society is more likely to be one that is a free society. And therefore, I will not abandon those principles, no matter how significant the pressure. Last question. Okay, [CARDINAL] more question. Then we have got to go. Why does your administration insist on imposing sanctions against [GPE]? Because they will not fight terror, and they will not join us in fighting terror. We have asked them to do some things, and they have not responded. And [ORG] passed a law saying that if [GPE] will not join-for example, booting out a [ORG] office out of [GPE]-that the President has the right to put sanctions on. I have yet to impose a sanction yet, but the bill enables me to do so. And we have talked to the [NORP] leader very clearly, and these are not -these are reasonable requests, and thus far, he has not heeded them. And that is why, if I make the decision to put on sanctions, it will be because he has not been a full partner in the war against terror. That would create another-more problems in the area. Well, we will see. But I think that people need to understand that there needs to be a full commitment. I mean, there is no need to harbor people who are expressing hatred. And if the world would join together to rout out terrorist organizations who want to kill innocent people, it would be a heck of a lot better off. See, here is my objection. We have got [NORP] killing [NORP] in [GPE]. There are [NORP] who will kill an innocent [NORP] for the sake of trying to create fear. We cannot let that happen. Civilized people must not allow that to happen. What they are trying to do is they are trying to shake our will, our collective will. For those of us who love freedom, they were trying to say, Well, do not work for freedom. Leave us alone so we can kill other people. We just cannot let that happen. There are too many peaceful people who need protection, and we want to help them. And most importantly, we want to help them help themselves, so they can be self-governing in [GPE]. But the killing of innocent life for political purposes is not acceptable in [DATE]. And you know that, and I believe that. I assure you that, you know, the [NORP] people really have nothing against the [NORP] people. Maybe the only-the only issue is the [NORP]-Israel. [NORP] issue, yes. --and the [NORP] bias to it. I hope we can get that solved. I mean, I truly believe that a peaceful state will emerge. And listen, I have got great respect for [NORP] culture. I have got great respect for the [NORP] religion. I reject this notion that this is a war against [NORP]. This is not a war against [NORP]. The [NORP] religion is a peaceful religion. [ORG] is peace. This is a war against evil people who want to kill innocent life. That is what this is. And it is-they have killed in our country. They have killed in your country. They killed a great man in [GPE]. And it is essential that freedom-loving people and peaceful people fight terror. It is the call of our time. It is the challenge of [DATE]. And we have got to work together to do so. And I appreciate you giving me a chance to visit and share my views to the people who need to learn more about our intentions and our deep desire for peace. I do thank you very, very, very much. Thank you, sir. And I hope to see you very soon. Good job. Very good job. Very good interview.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithelienakouzialarabiya", "text": "[INTERVIEWED1], it is nice to see you. It is nice to meet you. And how are you doing? Welcome. Come on in [FAC]. I am doing great. Thank you. I welcome you here. And I thank you for the opportunity to talk to you about some of the decisions that I have made right here in [FAC]. I am honored you have come. Actually, I want to tell the people of the Middle East that this is the place where big decisions are made. This is the office. But here it comes to my mind that how hard it is on you, [INTERVIEWED1], to take like-a big decision like war, for example-is it that easy to take a decision such like war-- No, it is the hardest decision a President can make. And when I campaigned for office, I never really thought about the decision to put men and women in harm's way. I never thought that that would happen. Circumstances changed, of course, and I had to make some very difficult decisions about how to protect our homeland and take action necessary to- the actions that, I think, will yield the peace. And so whether it be in [GPE] or [GPE], I was-I have made those decisions. And I will tell you, they are hard decisions, because I understand the consequences. One of the hardest things for me is to meet with a mother. I met with a mother [DATE] in [GPE] who lost her son in combat. And you know, those can be very tearful and emotional moments, and I understand that. And my-the only thing I try to do is provide as much comfort as I can and to assure the mom, in this case, that I thought the decision was necessary for peace and necessary for our security, and that I valued the fact that her son would volunteer, and that I vowed to honor that sacrifice by achieving our objectives. Anyway, this is the room where I make the decisions. But would these moments-I mean, these emotional moments, would they make you reconsider or rethink about what is going on in our area now? Not really. As a matter of fact, I leave most of the meetings reassured that the loved one, in this case, fully understanding what we were doing. See, I believe that, [CARDINAL], it is noble to liberate [CARDINAL] people from a tyrant; [CARDINAL], that we cannot allow [GPE] to be a safe haven for people who have sworn allegiance to those who have attacked us. In other words, I believe we must defeat the extremists there so we do not have to face them here at home. And [CARDINAL], I believe the spread of liberty will yield peace. And I believe the Middle East is plenty capable of being a part of the world where liberty flourishes. That is what I believe people want. And so I leave those meetings saddened by the fact that a person has pain in her heart-and [DATE] she had pain in her heart-but encouraged by the fact that her son died for a noble cause and a necessary cause. And that is exactly what she told me. Actually, I want to thank you again, [INTERVIEWED1], for giving us the opportunity to talk for the first time to the [NORP] world, to address them with the big concerns. I know we have a great deal of questions. I know you have a very tight schedule-- Sure. I want to show you [FAC], [CARDINAL] of the most famous areas-- It is a great chance for me. I heard, [INTERVIEWED1], also, that you are receiving an Iftaar-- Yes, I am. --in [FAC], which is, of course, a [NORP] ritual It is. But I want to tell you- and I hope this does not bother you at all- that in the [NORP] world, they think that [INTERVIEWED1]is an enemy of Islam-- Sure. --that he wants to destroy their religion, what they believe in. Is that in any way true, [INTERVIEWED1]? No, it is not. I have heard that, and it just shows-to show a couple of things: [CARDINAL], that the radicals have done a good job of propagandizing. In other words, they have spread the word that this really is not peaceful people versus radical people or terrorists; this is really about the-[GPE] not liking [ORG]. Well, first of all, I believe in an almighty God, and I believe that all the world, whether they be [NORP], [NORP], or any other religion, prays to the same God. That is what I believe. I believe that [ORG] is a great religion that preaches peace. And I believe people who murder the innocent to achieve political objectives are not religious people, whether they be a [NORP] who does that-we had a person blow up our-blow up a Federal building in [GPE] who professed to be a [NORP]. But that is not a [NORP] act, to kill innocent people. Exactly. And I just simply do not subscribe to the idea that murdering innocent men, women, and children-particularly [NORP] men, women, and children in the Middle East-is an act of somebody who is a religious person. We are having an Iftaar dinner tonight- I say, we -it is my wife and I. This is the seventh one in [DATE] I have been the President. It gives me a chance to say [PERSON]. The reason I do this is, I want people to understand about my country. In other words, I hope this message gets out of [GPE]. I want people to understand that one of the great freedoms in [GPE] is the right for people to worship any way they see fit. If you are a [NORP], an agnostic, a [NORP], a [NORP], a [NORP], you are equally [NORP]. And the value-the most valuable thing I think about [GPE] is that-particularly if you are a religious person-you can be free to worship, and it is your choice to make. It is not the state's choice, and you should not be intimidated after you have made your choice. And that is a right that I jealously guard. Secondly, I want [NORP] citizens to see me hosting an Iftaar dinner. That is a strong message for the [NORP]. It is a strong message. I want to remind your listeners that one of the first things I did after September the 11th is, I went to the local mosque. And I did because I wanted to send a message that those who came to kill [NORP] were young terrorists, and they do not reflect the views of the vast majority of peaceful people in the Middle East; and that our-precisely the message I was trying to send, the war is not a struggle against [NORP], the [NORP] religion; it is a struggle of honorable, peaceful people throughout the world against the few who want to impose their vision. Actually, [INTERVIEWED1], we are talking about these terrorists and what is going on in the world right now. Are you also a man of war, as some try to describe, [INTERVIEWED1]? Oh, no, no, I believe the actions we have taken will make it more likely peace happens. I dream it will be- the last thing I want to be is a President during war. Now, remember, we got attacked. And I responded, after careful deliberation, in an attempt to make sure that-with a strategy of protecting ourselves. We cannot allow these people that attacked us to have safe haven. We must not give them an opportunity to strike us again. And therefore, it is important to keep the pressure on. On the other hand, the ultimate way for peace is for people to realize the great blessings of liberty. And what is interesting-and what has taken place ought to be hopeful to people in the Middle East- is that [CARDINAL] young democracies have sprung up where people, when given a chance, voted. See, I believe there is a universal God. I believe the God that the [NORP] prays to is the same God that I pray to. After all, we all came from [PERSON]. I believe in that universality. And I believe a gift of that Almighty to every man, woman, and child is freedom; I really do. And I think people, if given a chance, will seize freedom. And it is liberty and free societies, not-they do not have to look like [GPE]-an [NORP] democracy is going to be [NORP]; it is going to reflect [NORP] traditions and [NORP] history. There are some universal aspects to liberty: [CARDINAL], people can vote; people can express their opinion; people can be in a free press; people ought to be allowed to go to the town square and protest against their government without fear of reprisal. And when given that opportunity, [CARDINAL] [NORP] went to the polls. So excuse me, [INTERVIEWED1], what you are trying to say is, sometimes a decision of war-you have to take a decision of war in order to achieve peace. That is exactly right. And that is what happened in [GPE]. First of all, yes. I was very concerned about the dictator in [GPE]. He was an enemy of [GPE]. He had ties to terrorists-I am not saying those who attacked us on [DATE], but I am saying ties to terrorists. He had a lot of money that he was willing to spend on weapons of mass destruction. We did not find the weapons, but he certainly had the knowledge. And in my judgment, over time, he would have been able to develop those weapons, and they would have been-one thing the Middle East does not need is a nuclear arms race. Yes, we are going to discuss this. Well, this guy does not - the man, [PERSON], had capability; but remember, there is also a human condition. I believe in human rights. I believe every life has value, whether it be an [NORP] life or a life of a person in the Middle East. And this brutal guy killed [CARDINAL] of his own people. And he was unbelievably brutal to neighbors and, as well, to [NORP]. And there is -liberation is a powerful-to me, liberating people is a powerful step toward peace. I wish we did not have to do this militarily. I was hoping that diplomacy would work. I gave diplomacy a lot of chance to work. But it did not . It did not work. So the choice was his, not mine. He had the choice as to whether or not this issue would be resolved peacefully. See, that is the interesting thing that has been turned around. And so I do not regret the decision. As a matter of fact, I feel it was the right decision to [DATE]. And now the question is, will [GPE] keep its commitment to the [CARDINAL] of [NORP] who want this society to work? And the answer to that is, yes, we will. And here, [INTERVIEWED1], I would love to ask-I mean, for the [NORP] now, they know and they keep on listening to the news. Sometimes we tell them we want to withdraw the troops. And now we are talking about the partition of [GPE], which is very, very bad news for the [NORP]. Yes, it is. I know you refused this. You want the unity of [GPE]. But what if this [NORP]-what if, in the next administration, another President comes to the office and believes in the partition of [GPE]? What is going to happen then? I do not think it will happen. I do not think it is going to happen. How do you guarantee? Well, first of all, an [NORP] President must understand that [GPE] is a sovereign nation operating under its own Constitution. And I am very confident that the will of [GPE] will prevail. And I know there is some noise out of here about partition. But most folks who follow this issue do not support partition, and they do not think it is a good idea. What [GPE] is going to have to do is get the proper balance between the central Government and the Provinces, the very same thing we have been worried about here in [GPE] for [DATE]. What is the right road between the [GPE] and [GPE]? So that is a constant discussion. But that is what they are going to have to do in [GPE] as well. And they are going to need the security situation such that they are able to have an honest political discourse. So our step [CARDINAL] was to help them secure their neighborhoods-and it is working- and make sure these radicals, such as [ORG] and some of these [NORP] groups, many of whom-which are criminal, are not able to have their way with this society. And now we will work toward helping these folks have the important discussion about what should be the role of [GPE], or what should be the role of the Provincial governments. And when they get that right, when they get settled out, then I think you will see a much more unified country. And it is going to be very hard for an [NORP] President or any other outside country to dictate to the [NORP], Here is what your government must look like, because the [NORP] will show over time that they are capable of making these decisions themselves, and they are making hard decisions right now, by the way. I know that your message, your deep message was-to the [NORP] world-was democracy, freedom, human rights. And you have said too many times that the first message is democracy, is that you have rights, you people of the Middle East, to be free. But now, is democracy still a priority? Because all we hear now in [GPE] is, let us achieve security; let us achieve stability. Is democracy in the Middle East on hold now, waiting for security first? Well, first of all, no. I strongly believe in the freedom movement. It is ingrained in my soul. It comes from my belief that freedom is universal. And I believe freedom is ingrained in everybody's soul, and if just given a chance, they will reach for it. Now, in [GPE], in order for the Government to have breathing space, to be able to do the hard work of reconciliation so that the dreams of the average citizen in [GPE] can be realized-which is a free society-there is got to be security. And so security is really a step, an important step, in the freedom movement. You cannot make the decisions if you are worried about getting blown up. And what the enemy wants to do, the enemy of a free [GPE], they want to create enough chaos and confusion inside [GPE] that causes people to doubt. And they want, by the way, to kill enough innocent people that causes the [NORP] people to lose their patience and determination to help freedom movements. Not every freedom movement requires military action. But freedom movement does require [GPE] commitment to helping reformers and just the average citizen realize the blessings of a free society. And so the freedom movement is the front and center of our foreign policy because I understand that the peace that we want-listen, we all want peace, except for those who are trying-- Except for those, exactly. But peace will succeed as more and more people become free. [INTERVIEWED1], we have moved from [FAC] to the beautiful garden, and here I would like to ask you question that go through the minds of the [NORP] world. Our world is going through very difficult [DATE]. Let me start with what people expect of me, which is [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED1], have you made the decision to strike [GPE], as some are saying, or trying to say that you will not leave your administration and office before you strike [GPE] militarily? I have made the commitment that I would continue to work with the world to speak with one voice to the [NORP], to [ORG], that we will work in ways that we can to make it clear to you that you should not have the know-how on how to make a weapon, because one of the great threats to peace and the world would be if [NORP] showed up with a nuclear weapon. It would give them an opportunity to blackmail or threaten or possibly follow through with their stated objective, which is the destruction of [GPE]. I, of course, said all options are on the table, but I made a pledge to the [NORP] people, we will work diplomatically to solve the problem. And that is why you see us at [ORG] working with the [ORG] countries and [GPE] and [GPE] to send that clear message, and that we are going to continue to impose sanctions and make it harder for the [NORP] Government to operate in the world until they change their mind, until they come to a new way forward. I have said that if they suspend their nuclear program, we will be at the table. But they have so far refused to do that. I have also spoken to the [NORP] people. And I want to make it clear to the people of [GPE] that [GPE] respects [GPE], respects the people, respects the proud tradition, and that the Government of [GPE] has taken decisions that make it harder for them to live their lives. It is the decisions of [ORG] that have led to the isolation of the country. And that if this Government would only be responsible, would listen to the world, would not continue its weapons program-the idea of being able to have the capacity to make a weapon-then there is a better way forward for the [NORP] people. But, [INTERVIEWED1], is there a redline, either a timeline or redline- I hear from analysts that [GPE] wants [DATE], or at least trying [DATE] to buy time in order for you to wait-to lose the time that you can make a big decision, such as going to war. In your judgment, is there a timetable? Is there a ceiling that if negotiations would fail, a decision to go to war would be made? The [NORP] regime must understand that I am dedicated to the proposition that they should not continue their desire to enrich, as will be people that follow me in office. There is universal concern about [NORP] ambition here in [GPE]. This is not a party issue, an issue between one party or the other. When the [NORP] President announces to the world that he is going to destroy an ally or announces to the world that he will end up defying the world-that-no matter who the President is, there is going to be a continued focus and effort to achieve this issue, to resolve this issue. This issue, before I move to [GPE], which also, a lot of [NORP] are waiting for this-is there-there are some leaking to the press, and particularly the [NORP] press-is it true that you have issued orders, [INTERVIEWED1], to your senior generals in the [NORP] military to prepare for a major and precise strike that could happen during [DATE] or [DATE]? I would call that empty propaganda. Evidently, there is a lot of gossip in parts of the country-world that try to scare people about me, personally, or my country or what we stand for. And that kind of gossip is just what it is: It is gossip; it is baseless gossip. [INTERVIEWED1], we have talked about [GPE]. And you have tried to give us a message to assure the [NORP] people-when we were in the garden together-that you do not believe in the partition or the division of [GPE]. And this is a very controversial issue in [GPE]. And it is scary to even some of the leadership in [GPE]. Just to continue and follow up with that issue, did we reach what we reached because of [NORP] mistakes or because of [NORP] mistakes and [ORG]? I think, first of all, the successes in [GPE] have been really quite extraordinary. [CARDINAL], the people of [GPE] no longer have to live under a dictatorship, a brutal dictatorship. Secondly, the [NORP] people wrote and ratified a modern Constitution. Thirdly, there is a Government that is in place that is beginning to take on the responsibilities of governing. For example, quite a few billions have been spent in the Provinces by the central Government. That does not get any focus, but there is a functioning Government; there is revenue sharing; there is money to the Provinces. There is still work to be done, no question about it. But the biggest problem facing [GPE] was because killers, bombers decided to murder innocent people in order to stop progress. So what I tell people is, is that the reason why there has not been smooth progress-and by the way, it is hard to transition from a dictatorship to a [NORP] democracy-but the main problem has been not the [NORP] or not [GPE], but it is been the fact that people have murdered. For example, what I find appalling is that [ORG] bombed a holy site, a [NORP] holy site; that there have been bombs in markets where innocent people are shopping and young children get destroyed by [NORP]-people who profess to be [NORP]. Their hearts are so hardened that they are willing to kill innocent people. And so the task is to deny these people their ability to blow up the innocent. And that is exactly what is happening because of [NORP] bravery and [NORP] forces and a commitment by the Government to deal with murderers. See, I believe murderers murder, and it does not matter whether you are a [NORP] murderer or a [NORP] murderer or a [NORP] murderer, you are a murderer. And the role of a state is to protect the innocent people from those murderers. And that is what you are seeing taking place in [GPE]. But in the meantime, government is beginning to function better. But people should not be surprised that it is not instant democracy. First of all, the leaders never have had any practice with democracy, and they are learning to get along after [DATE] of tension and resentment. I support Prime Minister [PERSON] strongly, and I support [ORG] strongly. I just had President [PERSON] in to [FAC] [DATE]. And the reason I do is because-I look for courage and commitment. And these leaders are courageous men, and they are committed to a free [GPE]. Has it been perfect progress? No. Is there more work to be done? You bet there is more work to be done. But are things better-getting better over time? Yes, they are. And that is what is important for the [NORP] people to know. And what is important for the [NORP] people to know is that we are going to support them, is that they have got our help because we want them to succeed. We want them to realize their dreams. [INTERVIEWED1], so the words that were said attributing to [ORG] or the [NORP] position about disappointment in Prime Minister [PERSON] is not true? You are not disappointed in Prime Minister [PERSON] and this [NORP] Government yet? I strongly support Prime Minister [PERSON]. Again, there is a lot of gossip here, as well as overseas. [CARDINAL] of the jobs that I have to continue to do is constantly repeat what-the position of my Government. And the position of my Government is that Prime Minister [PERSON] is a good man who is working hard, and we strongly support him. But it is not just Prime Minister [PERSON] that we support, we also support President [PERSON] or Vice President [PERSON] or Vice President [PERSON]. We support those who are committed to peace and committed to the welfare of the [NORP] people. And we support those who are willing to take on these extremists, the few who are murdering innocent people in order to create chaos and confusion inside of [GPE]. Again, I repeat: The situation is not perfect, but our country is not perfect. And I am proud of the courage of the [NORP] citizens. The [NORP] have been through a lot of bloodshed and violence, and yet they are still strong in their desire to achieve. The [NORP] will be successful. [INTERVIEWED1], let us move to [GPE]. And a lot of [NORP] are waiting. You have met with Mr. [PERSON] [DATE], and they are all talking about the upcoming elections in [GPE] that could or could not happen. Does [INTERVIEWED1]have a specific, preferred candidate in [GPE] that you wanted to support for the Presidency of [GPE]? Is there going to be elections in [GPE] that will take place? No, I have no specific candidate, and I told that to [PERSON]. I have a deep desire to help the [NORP] democracy succeed. I am deeply concerned about foreign interference into the Presidential election. I am concerned that neighboring countries will try to create instability so that this democracy does not succeed, just like I am deeply concerned that there is been murder on the streets of [GPE], including [PERSON] dad, and that the international community must follow through in an expeditious way-must follow through quickly in holding-in having an international tribunal, so that those who murdered-so that the facts come out and those who murdered would be held to account. There is just too many parliamentarians who are trying to work for a peaceful [GPE] being assassinated. And we need to know who is doing that assassinations. And when they are found out, they need to be held to account; there needs to be a consequence. And the international community has been too slow in getting the international tribunal moving. Thirdly, I told [PERSON] that I sent [CARDINAL] of our top military men into [GPE] to help them modernize their armed forces. And the reason I felt comfortable doing that is because Prime Minister [PERSON] showed courage and had-as did the [NORP] forces when they went out to rout out some extremists who were causing chaos or trying to cause chaos in [GPE]. And yet it became apparent to me that this military was full of courageous people but did not have the modern equipment necessary to defend the country from extremists and/or extremists who had been funded from outside influence. This is a very difficult situation. I am hopeful that obviously the Presidency will be resolved and that a unified government can move forward. [PERSON] shared with me the strategy of the [DATE] coalition, and I was more than willing to listen. I assured him and I assure the [NORP] people that we want to help you succeed. [INTERVIEWED1], are we able to say [DATE], for example, to the [NORP] people-and we know that [GPE] is the most powerful constituency in [GPE]-can we say to the [NORP] people that you, specifically, [INTERVIEWED1], will prevent any foreign interference in [GPE] that could be imposed from the outside and have a President that is being promoted by outside force? I think maybe that is a promise that I am not sure I could keep, because the [CARDINAL] thing that we did was, we worked with [GPE] to pass a [ORG] resolution to get [GPE], [NORP] presence, visible presence, out of [GPE]. However, I suspect that there is still a lot of [NORP] influence in [GPE] that is not helpful. And [CARDINAL] way to make it clear to [ORG] that we do not appreciate this is for [GPE] to-is to analyze the sanctions we have placed on the Government and think about other ways to continue to send a message and to work with our friends, particularly in Europe, to send the same message. In other words, there has to be a consequence for continued involvement. And the other thing is, is that I think it is going to be an important signal to send-is this tribunal. The international community said we ought to have a tribunal. I am frustrated frankly by the pace at which the tribunal is lingering; it is not moving. There needs to be a definitive moment where the evidence is laid out, and if it is clear evidence-in other words, if somebody's guilty, they ought to be held to account so that murder is not-so that there is this clear signal that murder is not going to be accepted. The brave souls of [GPE] who are being killed-[PERSON] dad was [CARDINAL], blown up, murdered. Why? Because he supported democracy. [NORP] democracy is for freedom. And that ought to send a clear message to people throughout the world that it is so important for those of us who live in free societies to support brave people who are promoting liberty. This man wanted nothing more than the [NORP] mom to be able to raise her child in peace. And yet somebody ordered or somebody followed through with coldblooded murder to deny those dreams for the [NORP] people. And the same thing is happening in [GPE], and it is unacceptable behavior. And [GPE] is firm in its desire to help the average citizen in the Middle East live in peace. It just so happens a peaceful Middle East will make [GPE] more secure. So we have common interests. And that is really what I want the people in the Middle East to hear, that each issue is an issue that is got difficult problems, but there is an interconnection. Extremists want to stop freedom, though. And we want you to live in peace. And we respect your religion, and we respect your humanity. And our desire for you is to realize your full potential, God-given potential. [INTERVIEWED1], of course I cannot conclude this interview without asking the most important question, that is the issue of [GPE]. Is [INTERVIEWED1]convinced, truly convinced inside, that it is possible yet to achieve peace between [GPE] and [GPE]? Can we achieve the [CARDINAL] states, living side by side, and not as [CARDINAL] enemies but [CARDINAL] friends? Is it possible or is it difficult or impossible to achieve? I believe in my soul, in my heart, that not only is it necessary that there be [CARDINAL] states living side by side in order to achieve peace, but it is possible. I am very optimistic we can achieve a [CARDINAL]-state solution. First, Prime Minister [PERSON] and President [PERSON] are committed to a [CARDINAL]-state solution and are making progress. We have done a lot of dialog between the [CARDINAL] men, and they are making progress. And they are making progress that-I believe-where the average [NORP] and average [NORP] will begin to see what a vision looks like; in other words, something to work for, something that is more tangible than just a [FAC] speech by the President or hopeful comments by others-something real. Secondly, that-you know, we are hosting a international conference that will be attended by interested parties-[ORG], you know, important [ORG] group will be there; a committee will be there from [ORG]. And it is an opportunity for there to be a serious-substantive discussions about the way forward and a [CARDINAL]-state solution. A lot of it is going to be empower both parties, give them confidence to follow through on the vision. I also want you to know that I fully understand the [CARDINAL]-state solution is a part of a comprehensive peace in the Middle East, and that our strategy is to get all concerned countries to the table; to get this comprehensive peace moving forward in a way that is tangible and real, so people can see it. In other words, I am not interested in just a photo opportunity, and I do not think anybody else is going to be interested in that. I really want to see if we can advance the progress. Step [CARDINAL] was for there to be a commitment by [GPE] and the [NORP] to this peace. And step [CARDINAL] is a commitment to the roadmap. In other words, nobody is going to want-have a state that becomes a launching pad for attack. The [NORP]-the average [NORP] does not want that, and surely [ORG] does not , and [GPE] cannot stand that. And so we have got-we got to work a lot with the [NORP] to help their security forces-and we are-and to help the President and the Prime Minister with economic aid, tangible economic aid so the average [NORP] can see a better life ahead, can realize there is something better than violence. And so I am very optimistic about it, about the prospects for peace. [PERSON] told me that time is over, [INTERVIEWED1]. Could you just- [TIME], if you allow me. And since I wanted to go ask you that question when we, after-20 days after commemorating September 11th, I said, when I meet [INTERVIEWED1], I am going to ask him a question. This massacre that happened on 9/11, it is very difficult for any [NORP] who lives in the [NORP] world that can imagine what happened to innocent [NORP] people on [DATE]. I would like to know what was your reaction the first time when you heard that [CARDINAL] [NORP] were among the hijackers who committed this crime and this terrorist act? How did that affect your relationship with the [GPE]-which plays a major role in the region-and particularly Crown Prince [PERSON]-now King [PERSON]-who is a personal friend of yours? King [PERSON] is a personal friend of mine, and I respect him. You know, I have seen murder before in my own country. I have seen evil people take innocent life. And when that is happened, I have not condemned everybody else around. I will give you an interesting story. I was in a community [DATE]-a gunman came and killed [CARDINAL] young [NORP] girls- this is [DATE]. And the gunman was killed. The [NORP] community, which is a religious community here in [GPE], went and reached out to the wife and children of the gunman in compassion and love. And I am not saying I was that-you know, I hope I could be that compassionate. It was a great act of compassion. And the reason I tell you that is, my reaction on [DATE] was, I vowed to find the killers-those who ordered the killing-and bring them to justice. On the other hand, never did it enter my heart and my mind to be embittered toward a group of people, innocent people, who had nothing to do with the murderer. In other words, I was focused on the individuals and their commanders, not citizens in the Middle East, of any country, particularly [GPE]. In other words, my first reaction was not, look, the [NORP] are bad people. My first reaction was, evil people came and killed, and we will react to protect ourselves. And we will react to protect ourselves in [CARDINAL] ways. [CARDINAL] is to work with concerned governments, including [GPE], to find those few that are willing to murder us. And those same murderers that came to [GPE] would very much like to murder the leaders in [GPE]. And so there is a lot of common ground throughout the world to rout out people and to bring them to justice. And the long term-these people believe something. There is an ideology behind their views, and the ideology basically is very different from one based upon freedom. Their ideology is, you cannot worship the way you see fit. And if you do not worship the way they want you to worship, you will be publicly beaten, or you will be killed, or you will be in prison. They do not believe, for example, young girls ought to be educated. I strongly disagree with that. I think one of the great potentials of the Middle East is women. And I certainly know, as a father, that I want my little girls to be-you know, have a good education, which they did. And I am confident other fathers want the same thing in the Middle East, even though we may not speak the same language or share the same religion. And so my reaction was-tough reaction to make sure we find those who ordered the killing and bring them to justice and to keep the pressure on them so they do not do it again-and I believe they want to do it again. But on the other hand, I have this sense of a possibility based upon something that is worked throughout the world, and that is, people being able to realize dreams through liberty. This is not the first time that societies have had to make choices. This is not the first time where people made the focused effort to become a free society. And it will not be the first time when a part of the world has gone from one that is been tense and full of unspeakable tragedy to one of peace. And that is where we are headed; we are headed to peace. And I cannot thank you enough for the opportunity to speak on a free channel to people throughout the Middle East. Our country is a loving country. It is hard for me to believe that people cannot look at [GPE] and say, Wow, what a compassionate group of people -because we are. And yet I understand the images of my country have been distorted. And I understand people say things about me personally that simply are not true. And so I appreciate the chance to come and talk to you directly and to talk to your viewers directly about what is in my heart and about the fact that my country is a country of peace. [INTERVIEWED1], on behalf of myself and [ORG], I would like to thank you very much for this opportunity. You were very generous with us on time; I know you have a very hectic schedule. Thank you very much for this opportunity. And I hope to meet with you again when you also are in a position to achieve some of our democracy in our region. Thank you, sir.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithbobschieffercbsnewsfacethenation", "text": "[INTERVIEWED1], thank you very much. Thank you. You have made speeches, you have addressed the joint session of [ORG], you have done interviews, but the polling continues to show that people are still skeptical about your health reform plans. [PERSON], the [NORP] senator from [GPE] -- who is done a lot of work on health care over [DATE], summed it up this way, these are his words, he said, If anyone believes that [ORG] can do a plan that will cost [MONEY], cover all [NORP], not raise taxes on anyone, not increase the deficit, not reduce benefits or choices for our families and seniors, then I have a bridge to sell you. Have you promised too much, [INTERVIEWED1]? No, I do not think I have promised too much at all. Look, first of all, everybody acknowledges this is a problem -- everybody -- acknowledges that the current path we are on is unsustainable, not just for the people who do not have health insurance but for those who do. We just had a study come out [DATE] showing that premiums for families went up [PERCENT] over [DATE]. Those costs probably went up even higher for the average employer. And that is part of the reason why you are seeing, [DATE], fewer [NORP] having health insurance from their employers than they previously did. Health care inflation went up [PERCENT] [DATE] when inflation was actually negative, because of this extraordinary recession. So we know that standing still is not an option. Now, what I have said is that we can make sure that people who do not have health insurance can buy into an insurance pool that gives them better bargaining power. For people who have health insurance, we can provide health insurance reforms that make the insurance they have more secure. And we can do that mostly by using money that every expert agrees is being wasted and is currently in the existing health care system. So, in fact, what we have got right now is [PERCENT] consensus on how we would accomplish that. Now, let me be honest, with a piece of legislation this complicated, and a sector the economy that is [CARDINAL] of our economy, there is a reason why, for [DATE], people have been talking about this and it has not gotten done. It is hard -- -- and there are a lot of moving parts. And so I appreciate the fact that the [NORP] people are really cautious about this, because it is important to them, and the majority of people still have health insurance. What I am trying to do is to explain the facts, which are: If we do not do anything, a lot of [NORP] are going to be much worse off, and, over time, the federal budget just cannot sustain it. Let me just ask you, the main concern that people seem to have is that this plan is somehow going to mean a tax on middle-class [NORP]. Now, you promised during the campaign that that was not going to happen -- no tax increase on people who made [MONEY], 000, no payroll tax, no capital gains, no tax of any kind on [NORP]. Can you still make that promise to people [DATE]? I can still keep that promise, because, as I said, [CARDINAL] of what we have proposed would be from money that is already in the health care system but just being spent badly. And, as I said before, this is not me making wild assertions. You know, you always hear about waste and abuse in [GPE] , and usually it does not mean much because nobody ever finds where that waste and abuse is. This is money that has been directly identified, that [ORG], that [NORP] and [NORP] experts agree is there, that is not improving the quality of our health. So the lion's share of money to pay for this will come from money that is already in the system. Now, we are going to have to find some additional sources of revenue for the other third or so of the health care plan. And what I -- and I have provided a long list of approaches that would not have an impact on middle-class [NORP]. They are not going to be forced to pay for this. Insurance companies and drug companies are going to have to be ponying up, partly because right now they are receiving huge -- But are not they going -- -- subsidies from folks. -- to then pass that on to consumers? I mean, that is what, you know, [ORG] is saying. They are starting a big ad campaign right now. They say, you are going to put these taxes on the these insurance companies, on people that make things like x-rays, and lab tests, and all of that, and they are just going to turn right around and pass it right on to the consumer. Here is the problem: They are passing on those costs to the consumers anyway. The only difference is -- But this would be more. No. The difference is that they are making huge profits on it, [PERSON]. I mean, let us take the [ORG] HMO programs that are being run by insurance companies. It is estimated by everybody that they are overcharging by [PERCENT]. This amounts to [MONEY] over [DATE], [MONEY] a year, [MONEY] a year that is just going to pad their profits. has not been shown to make [ORG] recipients any healthier. And, in fact, because those huge subsidies are going to insurance companies, [ORG] recipients are not getting a good deal. Now, if we are enforcing what should be the rules around [ORG], and making sure that people are getting a bang for the buck, it is not going to be possible for insurance companies to simply pass on those costs to [ORG] recipients, because ultimately it is Uncle Sam that is paying for those services anyway. Look, bringing about change in this town is always hard. When you have got special interests that are making [MONEY], absolutely they are going to want to keep as much of the profits that they are making as possible. And, by the way, those insurance companies, even during these down years, have been making terrific profits. We do not mind them making profits, we just want them to be accountable to their customers. Let me ask you a little bit about the tenor of this debate. It seems to me that there is a sort of meanness that is settled over our political dialogue. It started [DATE] at these town-hall meetings. We saw this outbreak when you spoke on the -- to the joint session. Some people clearly just do not agree with your policy -- Absolutely. -- but there seem to be others that are just mad -- -- and angry. President [PERSON] is now saying that he thinks it is racial. [PERSON] says it could be dangerous. What do you think it is all about? Well, look, what I think we have to remember is that, at various periods in [NORP] history, people get pretty rambunctious when -- -- it comes to our democratic debate. That is not new. And every president who is tried to bring about big changes, I think, elicits the most passionate responses. I mean, if you hear what people had to say about [PERSON], or what they had to say about [PERSON], or what they had to say about [PERSON] when he first came in and was trying to change our approach to government -- that elicited huge responses. Now, I think that what is driving passions right now is that health care has become a proxy for a broader set of issues about how much government should be involved in our economy, particularly coming off a huge economic crisis. And the only thing that I have been trying to say is: Number [CARDINAL], I have no interest in increasing the size of government. I just want to make sure we have got a smart government that is regulating, for example, the financial institutions smartly, so I do not have to engage in any kind of bank bailouts -- that is point number [CARDINAL]. And point [CARDINAL], even though we are having a passionate disagreement here, we can be civil to each other, and we can try to express ourselves, acknowledging that we are all patriots, we are all [NORP], and not assume the absolute worst in people's motives. And I have to -- [CARDINAL] last point I have got to make, [PERSON], and that is, I do think part of what is different [DATE] is that the [TIME] news cycle, and cable television, and blogs, and all this, they focus on the most extreme elements on both sides. They cannot get enough of conflict. It is catnip to the media right now. And so the easiest way to get [TIME] of fame is to be rude to somebody. In that environment, I think it makes it more difficult for us to solve the problems that the [NORP] people sent us here to solve. [INTERVIEWED1], [CARDINAL] former directors of the [ORG] have sent you a letter [DATE] asking you to reverse the decision of the attorney general to reopen the criminal investigation of [ORG] interrogations that took place after the attacks on [DATE]. Would you consider that? Well, first of all, I have the utmost respect for the [ORG]. I have said consistently that I want to look forward, and not backward, when it comes to some of the problems that occurred under the previous administration when it came to interrogations. I do not want witch hunts taking place. I have also said, though, that the attorney general has the job to uphold the law. So you intend to let him go forward? He is got to make a judgment, in terms of what is going -- what has occurred. My understanding is, it is not a criminal investigation at this point. They are simply investigating what took place. And I appreciate the former [ORG] directors wanting to look out for an institution that they helped to build. But I continue to believe that nobody's above the law, and I want to make sure that, as president of [GPE] , that I am not asserting, in some way, that my decisions overrule the decisions of prosecutors who are there to uphold the law. [GPE] : We keep hearing that General [PERSON] is about to ask you for [CARDINAL] of new [NORP] troops to go to [GPE] -- our [PERSON] has reported that. Are you considering something of that nature -- sending that large a force to [GPE] ? I am not considering at that point, because I have not received the request. But I just want to remind people how we got here. You know, when I came in [GPE] was adrift, because we, frankly, had not focused on it. I immediately ordered a top-to-bottom review. Part of that review was, when General [PERSON] got to [GPE] , for him to do his own assessment. In the meantime, I sent [CARDINAL] 000 troops to make sure that we could secure the election that was going to take place in [DATE]. The election is now complete. General [PERSON] has completed his assessment. But my job it make sure that we get a strategy that focuses on my core goal, which is to dismantle, defeat, destroy [ORG] and its allies that killed [NORP], and are still plotting -- Well, if he asked you -- -- to kill [NORP]. -- for that many troops, you are going to have a hard time saying no, are you not? Well, no, let us be clear. My central focus is: What we doing to protect the [NORP] people and the [NORP] homeland? [GPE] and [GPE] are critical elements in that process. But the only reason I send a -- single -- young man or woman in uniform anywhere in the world is because I think it is necessary to keep us safe. And so whatever decisions I make are going to based first on a strategy to keep us safe, then we will figure out how to resource it. We are not going to put the cart before the horse, and just think by sending more troops we are -- But -- -- automatically going to make [NORP] safe. Did not you say on [DATE] that you had announced the comprehensive new strategy for [GPE] ? I thought you already had a strategy. Well, we did. But what I also said was that we were going to review that [DATE], because, you know, this is a very complicated terrain; we had just started getting our troops in -- in fact, the [CARDINAL] 000 that I already ordered in are just now getting in place. And what I did not want is a situation in which we are just continually sending more and more troops, or putting more and more resources, without having looked at how the whole thing fits together; making sure that our efforts, in terms of building [NORP] capacity is in place, that our civilian and diplomatic efforts are in place. So what we are going to do is continue to reassess, review what is taking place, and make sure that our strategy and resources fit together for the aim of making sure that [ORG] is not able to attack [GPE] . You announced [DATE] a major change in [NORP] strategic strategy when you said that we would not go forward with the missile defense system that would be there on the border of [GPE]. The [NORP] saw that as a poke in the eye from the very beginning. But even people who agree that that missile system is out of place are asking questions. Should not you have tried to get something from the [NORP] in exchange for doing that? Well, keep in mind that when [PERSON] announced his strategy for putting missile defense in place -- in [GPE] and in [GPE], I said at the time I think we need missile defense, but I want to make sure it works, that it is cost- effective, that the technologies are operable, that it is our best possible strategy. And that had not been shown. So when I came in I asked the same people who had signed off on the first one, [PERSON], my secretary of [ORG], as well as the Joint Chiefs of Staff, tell me, given the intelligence you have got now, and the technology we possess, and what we know about the [NORP] threat -- which has always been our main concern, not [GPE], tell me if the system that we have designed is the best possible system. And they came back to me and said, you know what, given what we know now, we actually think that this is a better way of doing it. So we are not eliminating missile defense. In fact, what we are doing is putting a system in that is more timely, more cost-effective, and that meets the actual threats that we perceive coming from [GPE]. [GPE] had always been paranoid about this. But [PERSON] was right. This was not a threat to them. And this new program will not be a threat to them. So, you know, my task here was not to negotiate with the [NORP]. The [NORP] do not make determinations about our -- what our defense posture is. We have made a decision about what will be best to protect the [NORP] people, as well as our troops in Europe and our [NORP]. If the byproduct of it is that the [NORP] feel a little less paranoid, and are now willing to work more effectively with us to deal with threats like ballistic missiles from [GPE] or the nuclear development in [GPE] , you know, then that is a bonus. [INTERVIEWED1], our time is up. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Appreciate it, [PERSON].", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretaryjaycarney70", "text": "We will make a still available. I believe that is what we will do. Standard practice. And with that, I will take some questions. [PERSON]. Hi. A couple of questions on [GPE]. Did they -- did the President not discuss drawing down [GPE] troops during the [ORG] meeting? As you know -- Was that not a topic of discussion? It was not a topic of discussion. It was not on the agenda. The President has not received yet a recommendation from his commanders or the Secretary of [ORG] for a troop drawdown figure. That will obviously be a decision he makes relatively soon in keeping with the commitment he made when he announced his [ORG] strategy back in [DATE], that a drawdown would begin in [DATE]. But this was not a subject of [DATE]'s meeting. Should we expect his announcement [DATE], or in [DATE], the troop -- I do not have an update on scheduling. Obviously the operative date here is [DATE] in terms of the beginning of the drawdown, but I do not have a date for you. The President said in [DATE] that -- in an interview with [ORG], that the drawdown was going to be significant, and then [PERSON] recently said it was going to be modest. So can you sort of -- is it going to be significant? Well, first of all, as I said, [PERSON], the President has yet to make a decision on the numbers. We have always said that it would be real. There were skeptics who suggested at the time when the President announced his policy that the [DATE] date for the beginning of a drawdown was not real. It will, in fact, begin then. The President is going to make his decision, as he has said all along, based on conditions on the ground, not whether or not there will be a drawdown, or the beginning of a drawdown, but the size and scope and pace of the drawdown. So, again, he has not made the decision, but it is -- he will make it fairly soon. In an interview [TIME] he talked about the fact that this will be [DATE] of transition and has talked about some of the progress we have made in the mission, including obviously the elimination of [PERSON], the fact that we have taken the fight to [ORG] effectively, and have [ORG] back on its heels; there has been some stabilization in [GPE], some real progress, that our mission there has achieved; and that it is part of a process that is underway of transferring security lead to the [NORP] national security forces. And that process obviously will reach its culmination, as promised in [GPE], at [GPE], at the [ORG] conference, will reach its culmination in [DATE]. Will there be a speech to the nation for this? I do not have a forum or a format or a venue yet for you. Obviously he will make a decision and then inform the public of his decision. But I would not -- speculation not withstanding, I would not put too much credence in that at this point, because he has not yet made a decision. [INTERVIEWED1], the President gave an interview to a [NORP] newspaper over [DATE] ahead of Chancellor [PERSON]'s visit [DATE]. He said that the [CARDINAL] sides agree on some things and disagree on others. Can you talk about some of the things that they disagree on? I think I'd need something a little specific than that. How about the [ORG], and specifically funding for [GPE], which is looking for further -- possibly further bailout money? Does [GPE], and will the President specifically, encourage [GPE] to provide that funding in Europe, or would [GPE] support [ORG] money going into that again? Well, what we have said and what we continue to say, [PERSON], is that our [NORP] -- we are in constant communication with our [NORP] counterparts about Europe's fiscal -- financial situation, rather. They said -- they have said that they will do whatever is necessary to tackle this problem, and we believe it is completely within their capacity to do that. I do not have any more specifics about it, but that is our position. Well, can -- somebody might hear that and say in their capacity means the [GPE] does not want [ORG] funds, which would, by nature of the [ORG], be using [GPE] funding as well to go towards [GPE]. Well, without getting more specific, I think that by saying that it is within their capacity to do that, we believe that they are capable of handling this challenge successfully. And in addition to that issue, can you give us kind of a feel for what else will be discussed between the [CARDINAL] leaders [DATE]? Well, I think it is a vital relationship, obviously. [GPE] is an important partner of ours globally, not just in Europe. And the President very much looks forward to meeting with the Chancellor again. I do not have the number of meetings they have had, but they have been numerous. And he looks forward to her visit and to the meetings that they will have, because it is a very important partnership. Would the President like to see [GPE] more involved in foreign policy issues such as [GPE] and [GPE]? I am sure they will discuss the range of foreign policy issues that are out there that are of common interest to both countries. I think, again, the relationship is important, the cooperation is excellent, and I am sure they will talk about those issues as well as many others. Last question on that. Is this a state visit or an official visit? Now, my understanding, there is a nomenclature here that has to do with whether the visitor is a head of state or a head of government, and my understanding here is that because she is head of government, that this is an official visit. Wasn't it announced as a state visit? I'd have to check. I do not know. Again, this is a semantic technicality. It is official. But it is a state dinner [DATE], right? It is a state dinner [DATE]. We can get you some of the details of the distinctions, but -- [PERSON] must have gotten the invite. We are just awfully glad that she is coming as head of government of the -- May I help out with this? Yes, please. What can you tell us? Officially it is an official visit, with a state dinner. And the distinction is as you mentioned. I was right, is what he is saying. I always like it when -- Anybody else have something similar to say about my -- It will be -- it will be [inaudible] personal meeting, according to the President in the interview, [INTERVIEWED1]. Thank you. Excellent. Thank you, thank you. In the same way that the President asked General [PERSON] to give him an alternative plan when he was coming up with the -- when they were coming up with [ORG] plan back in [DATE], is he soliciting proposals from any other generals or any other individuals in government as an alternative to the recommendation from the commanders that he is waiting for? [PERSON], not that I am aware of and I do not think that is the case. What needs to be understood here is that the debate and discussion about the President's [ORG] policy took place, as you know, in [DATE] and resulted in the President's decision of the policy that we have been implementing as an administration ever since, both militarily and through our civilian agencies. This decision about the size of the initial drawdown is one in keeping with the decision the President made back in [DATE]. There is not enormous debate about this, despite some reporting to the contrary. In fact, the context for this decision is fairly narrow, which is what -- the President is, as he has all along, moving to the next stage of implementing a policy that he thought long and hard about in making a decision that he made in [DATE] -- or rather [DATE]. So he looks forward to the recommendation that he gets from his commanders through Secretary [PERSON]. I believe if there are options contained within that recommendation I am sure those options will be reviewed and discussed. The way this process normally works, it is rare that there is simply [CARDINAL] alternative put on the table. But I do not expect a -- this is not a reopening of a process that was completed in [DATE]. But [PERSON] has said he expects the drawdown to be modest. Do you expect that the recommendation coming from [PERSON] -- Well, I think that depends on -- -- is going to be anything other than a range of modest drawdowns? Again, it depends on how you define what modest is or significant is. The President -- it will be a real drawdown, but it will depend on the conditions on the ground, which he relies on his commanders to inform him about. Now, there will be, I am sure, some discussion about how you implement that decision, but the policy decision has been made. This is a step along the way of implementing that policy. [DATE] [TIME], the [ORG] -- or [DATE], rather, the [ORG] passed a resolution saying that the President has [DATE] to provide a whole bunch of information and answer a whole bunch of questions about the [GPE] military operation with the not-so-veiled threat that the [ORG] bill is coming up and that funds for that operation could be withheld if answers are not forthcoming. Does the administration intend to answer all of the demands from the [ORG] for information? And has the administration sought at all the opinion of [ORG] at [ORG], as to how closely or whether or not [ORG] is in compliance with the War Powers Act? As you know, [PERSON], we believe that we are acting consistent with the War Powers resolution on the issue -- But did you seek [ORG]'s guidance on that? I am not aware of any special seeking of guidance that we asked for. We believe we are acting consistent with the War Powers resolution. On the question of congressional consultations and the answering of questions, there have been numerous briefings, both classified and unclassified briefings, on the [GPE] participation in the [ORG] mission as well as in -- on our other actions with regard to [GPE]. And those consultations will continue. And to the extent that those consultations -- within those consultations there are questions asked that we can answer, we will answer them without question. But we feel confident that, A, the President is executing a policy decision that he made in exactly the manner that he said he would; that our consultations have been consistent, and that we are acting consistently with the War Powers resolution; and finally that we would welcome and support a resolution similar to or exactly like the [PERSON]-McCain resolution in the [ORG]. So you are not going to provide any paper? It is just if -- Well, I do not know. I mean, if they ask for paper, we may provide paper, but only as part of the general consultations that we have been having. It is simply incorrect to suggest that we have not been informing or consulting with [ORG] regularly on this important matter, because we have, and we believe it is important to consult with [ORG] on things like this. I am not suggesting that [ORG] -- No, I know, I am not suggesting that you are suggesting that. I am simply -- The [ORG] is suggesting it very, very clearly. Well, again, I would say that in response to that, we have consulted regularly and we will continue to. And we will answer questions regularly, as we have. It does not sound -- correct me if this interpretation is wrong -- it does not sound like you take this [ORG] resolution very seriously. Well, we have said it was unhelpful, and we think it is very important, as we continue to act with our partners, to implement [ORG] [DATE] and implement the actions that we have taken, the non-lethal actions we have taken unilaterally and multilaterally -- that we continue to do that. We have made enormous progress. We think the progress will continue. We have been encouraged by the steps taken by the opposition in [GPE]. We have been encouraged by some of the declarations that they have made about their support for democratic reform. And we are encouraged by the regular indications that those around [PERSON] are beginning to realize that the future of that regime is very bleak and that the [NORP] people need to be the ones who will decide who will lead them into the future. Last question, I am sorry, but it is just the [ORG] has passed this resolution fairly handily, clearly indicating they do not feel like they have been consulted enough, demanding a list of information about this operation. You are saying it is not helpful -- you are suggesting that you are not going to provide the information -- No, I did not say that at all. -- in written form unless they specifically request it. You might supply some of it; you might not supply other parts of this information. They have the legal authority to cut off funding for the [GPE] operation, and the defense bill is coming up in [DATE]. You are not concerned about this at all? We obviously take seriously our obligation to consult with [ORG], and to the extent that there are questions that need to be answered, we will of course endeavor to answer them. And we take seriously concern expressed by members about questions they have about our mission here. We do believe we have acted consistent with the War Powers resolution and we do think it would be -- we would welcome the support of [ORG] in the form of a resolution similar to the one put forward by senators -- the bipartisan resolution put forward by Senators [PERSON] and [PERSON] and others. Beyond that, again, it will depend on the consultations we have with [ORG], the questions we can answer as we go forward, but we want to continue to keep the pressure on the [PERSON] regime and continue our support for the [ORG] mission, which is protecting [NORP] civilians from [PERSON]'s forces. What is [ORG] has some questions --? Let me -- you know how this works. I will get to you. Go ahead. [INTERVIEWED1], on [GPE], can you give us a sense of the President's process in coming to a decision? I mean, once he surveys his advisors, he sees where they are, what is next? Is he consulting with outside advisors? How often is he consulting with advisors? Well, he consults regularly with his team of national security advisors -- small nsa , not just his single National Security Advisor -- but members of his national security team on this issue. He has his regular [NORP]-Pakistan meeting that he had [DATE]. And I am sure he will have additional meetings as he begins to consider the recommendations that he receives from Secretary [PERSON] and General [PERSON], and then will evaluate the options before him and make a decision consistent with the original decision that he made in [DATE] to begin the drawdown in [DATE]. Is he consulting with outside advisors at all? Well, I do not -- in general, the President sometimes seeks input from others who do not work within the administration. I do not know that he is doing that in this case. Again, this is not a debate here about a policy. This is the implementation of a policy that has already been decided on. And so I do not anticipate the seeking of opinion in some broad circle beyond a team of national security advisors that he has a great deal of confidence in. But it sounds like he is getting some -- there will be some differing opinions. It sounds like -- Well, that is why he is President. I mean, he has to make the final decision on these many issues. I would say that everyone understands what the policy decision is -- the policy decision he made in [DATE]; the fact that the beginning of the drawdown will begin in [DATE] and will end with the full -- or rather, the process that begins with the drawdown or has begun already but which the drawdown is a part of, which is a transfer of security responsibility to an [NORP] lead across the country, will be complete in [DATE], as spelled out in [GPE]. And so this is a moment along the way -- it is an important one because it is the implementation of a key element of the policy decision he made in [DATE], but it is a part of a policy decision; it is not a new thing. And on the golf outing with the Speaker, what is he hoping to achieve with that? Just resolve all their differences, [CARDINAL] holes. They will have [TIME]. I mean, really, what are they -- what is he -- Well, look, I think, as the President has said, he likes and gets along with the Speaker of the [ORG]. They have obviously spent a fair amount of time together [DATE] and [DATE] working on a number of important agreements that were reached, both the tax cut deal in [DATE], and the continuing resolution which secured funding for the government, and spending cuts for the rest of [DATE]. And obviously they have a lot to talk about. But I think it is -- this is more of a social outing. This is not -- they will not, despite what I just said, they will not resolve the budget negotiations on the back [CARDINAL]. At least I do not expect that. Any tears? I am sorry? Any tears? No, I do not think so. But he is looking forward to it. Will they share a cart? I do not think they have worked out the -- you know how these things are -- they have not worked out the fine details yet. But they -- look, they get along very well, I think. [INTERVIEWED1], is there -- is President [PERSON] giving any thought to personally attending the next round of deficit-reduction talks [DATE]? No. The President had asked his Vice President, [PERSON], to lead these negotiations. And I would simply say I think that the fact that he did that demonstrated the significance that the President places on these talks. As many of you wrote about or spoke about on air, the Vice President has been a key player in some major negotiations, including those that led to the agreement [DATE]. And it is a fitting role for him to play given his strong relationships on [ORG] in both parties. So that process is important. It is very high-level. It involves members of the [ORG] and the [ORG], in [ORG] and [ORG], appointed by their leaders, so we certainly hope that the leaders have faith in those they appointed to negotiate on their behalf. Obviously, as we get to -- closer to an endpoint in these negotiations, there will no doubt be direct presidential involvement, engagement in some form -- whether that is phone calls or meetings or -- he is the President, and as with the decision he makes on troop drawdowns, that this will be -- when there is a deal, and we are confident there will be a deal, this will be decision that he makes for the administration. But he has a great deal of confidence in the progress the negotiations being led by the Vice President has made. And is there any frustration at [ORG] about the congressional schedule? [DATE] [ORG]'s here, [DATE] [ORG] is here. Does that make it more difficult? We obviously think it is important that the talks continue, and that is why we have a meeting that the Vice President will lead on [DATE], despite the fact that [CARDINAL] of the houses is out. But we understand how this works, and that when you are bringing together members from both houses with members of the administration, that you have to work through scheduling conflicts, and that is what we are trying to do. On [GPE]. What is the status of discussions with [GPE] on possibly keeping [GPE] forces there beyond [DATE]? I have nothing new for you on that. First of all, I'd like to say that we obviously are aware of the fact that we lost [GPE] servicemen [DATE], and we express condolences to their families once notifications have been made. And it is a stark reminder that those who serve in [GPE] do so in a way that continues to place them at risk, despite the enormous progress that has been made there. And then on your question, I have nothing new to announce. The process, as you know, is simply that we are abiding by the status of forces agreement that will have us withdrawing the remainder of our troops by [DATE]. I and others have said that we will entertain requests by the [NORP] government if -- that we will entertain, in terms of discuss, possible requests for some sort of new status of forces agreement that would be obviously quite different from the one we have now. But as of now, we fully intend to fulfill our obligation under that [ORG] and withdraw all our remaining forces. As you know, since the President has come into office, we have withdrawn [CARDINAL] [GPE] troops from [GPE], and, again, according to the [ORG], we will draw down to [CARDINAL] by [DATE]. Admiral [PERSON] said in [DATE] that without an agreement within [DATE], soon, we would have to start making irreversible decisions, he said. Presumably that means start bringing some troops home. Well, we have been bringing troops home consistently, and I think, obviously, there are [DATE] in a year. And we are moving along according to the existing agreements we have, but obviously we have different means of discussing with the [NORP] government whatever ideas they may have about any other kind of agreement we might reach. But for now, we will keep the commitments that we have made. And there have been no talks on a new SOFA since the -- since Admiral [PERSON] -- Well, I mean -- I have nothing to announce on that. I have no specific negotiations that are underway. Obviously we are in consultation with the [NORP] government on a regular basis through our ambassador, through our military commander there, and through others, but no talks in that sense. On the President's [GPE] decision, is cost in any way a factor of how many troops are brought home [DATE]? Or the initial drawdown -- No. -- does cost impact that at all? No, as I said before in response to a question regarding a story about this, obviously, as enormously powerful and wealthy we are as a country, we have limited resources, and we have to make decisions -- the President has to make decisions about priorities. Having said that, his policy decision that he made in [DATE] had as its objectives not -- had disrupt, dismantle, and defeat [ORG], and stabilize [GPE] so it would not become a haven for terrorists as it had been in the past, terrorists who have designs on [GPE] and its allies. Those are the objectives, and the decisions he will make going forward regarding withdrawal and troop drawdowns will be based on the success of fulfilling those objectives and the conditions on the ground as he makes those decisions. And not cost? Well, certainly within the broader sense of we have limited resources, we have to make decisions about our priorities, obviously every decision is made with a mind towards cost, but this is about [GPE] national security interests, primarily. I just want to close the loop on something you responded to earlier on [GPE]. There is no -- the policy decision has been made. That is not changing. That is not what is up to review. Correct. This is simply about the number of troops that come home, period. Right. Okay, this is -- fair enough. On [GPE], the -- you said it was unhelpful. Do you plan on responding to what the resolution called for, which is an explanation in [DATE]? I do not have anything new for you on that beyond my answer to the question about this earlier. Again, we believe we are acting consistent with the War Powers resolution. You do not believe you owe them any more explanation? Well, we owe them in a sense that we owe -- and we have said repeatedly, both prior to and throughout this period when there is been a mission in [GPE], that we feel obligated to consult regularly with [ORG]. And we have. Why do they disagree? There are always disagreements in [GPE] about different things. I think the overall thing that we agree on is that we need to make sure that the [ORG] mission succeeds. We need to make sure through the non-lethal measures that we have embarked upon that we continue to keep the pressure on [PERSON], and ensure that [GPE] in the future has -- its people have the opportunity to choose their future. And I think that we enjoy broad support within [ORG] for those goals. But the [ORG] has yet to pass this resolution -- you brought up [PERSON] -- Well, we do not obviously control -- we do not control the congressional calendar, regrettably. But the -- our position on that has not changed. We believe that there is bipartisan support for the actions that we are taking, and we would welcome an expression of it. And I know [PERSON] is in the region right now -- [GPE] -- has anybody in the administration been in touch with President [PERSON] in [GPE]? Not that I am aware of with President [PERSON]. As you know, [PERSON] has been in touch with the Vice President, the acting President in President [PERSON]'s absence. Has he asked him to -- Well, I do not want to get into the detail -- Is it the same message to him as it was to [PERSON]? Agree to this transition of power? Could you expound upon what did he say -- Yes, the -- our position is that we support the agreement that President [PERSON] had talked about signing several times and did not , which would lead to a transfer of power. And we also have supported and we made calls for cessation of violence, and we mean that on both sides. And we want a peaceful and orderly transition, and that is consistent with the [NORP]' constitutional process; and we -- our position has not changed, and we believe that an immediate transition is in the best interests of the people and the best interests of maintaining stability in obviously a very unstable situation. Has [GPE] been helpful to us on this? Well, [GPE] is an important ally of ours, and obviously [PERSON] -- Have they helped the situation? I think it is fair to say they have been helpful, and as our -- as have others in the region who have worked with us and others to try to bring about a transition there that is best -- is in the best interest of the people of [GPE], and from our perspective in the best interest of the national security interest of [GPE].The [ORG] nominee is withdrawing his nomination. Does [ORG] or the administration already have other people queued up, considering [ORG] has blocked [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] nominees -- What I can say on that is that we will move quickly, we will move forward as soon as possible with a replacement nominee. I will take this opportunity to, again, as I did on paper, express our disappointment with the partisan obstructionism that led to Mr. [PERSON] to withdraw his nomination. I mean, this is an enormously qualified candidate, and you know the process is broken when a Nobel laureate in economics is denied a post in [ORG]. And that is a problem. And we regret that very much. And we certainly echo the sentiment that [PERSON] expressed in his op-ed [TIME]. And what is the impact -- I guess it may be hard to assess for him in particular for the [ORG] board -- but the impact of nominees not getting into their positions more broadly -- Well, more broadly, look, we have obviously a situation, when we talk about economic appointments, where this is a top priority of the President, it is the top priority supposedly of [ORG], both parties, both [ORG], and it is vital that we have people in positions, whether it is at the [ORG] or elsewhere, who are capable of fulfilling the responsibilities of the jobs that they have been nominated for in the name of improving the economic situation in this country. And again, when you have highly qualified, highly regarded nominees for posts like this, they should be -- the [ORG] should act accordingly and allow that nomination to go forward. And this is somebody, in the case of [PERSON], who had benefited from bipartisan support on several occasions through committee votes. So it is very regrettable. And just [CARDINAL] more question on [GPE]. I know you were already asked this already, but if the administration has consistently consulted [ORG], why do they continue to have so many questions? Well, look, it is their prerogative to have questions, and it is our obligation to answer those questions. I think that is partly how the process works. So we do not have a problem with the fact that they have additional questions. And we will endeavor to answer those questions, as we have throughout this process. Was [ORG] surprised by [PERSON] op-ed? No. And was there more that [ORG] or the President could have done to get his nomination through? I do not believe so. And for [PERSON]'s meeting [DATE], the President in his radio address cited the [NORP] debt crisis as one of the headwinds that is leading to a struggling recovery now. Is that something that he will stress with the [NORP] Chancellor [DATE]? I am sure it will be part of their conversation. Obviously the economy writ large is an issue that is of interest to both leaders and it is an issue that both are addressing in different ways. So absolutely, as the President noted in his address and has noted elsewhere, we have been hit with obviously the fallout from the tsunami and earthquake in [GPE], high energy prices, and the continuing drag presented by the [NORP] -- euro zone economic issue. So I am sure that in many ways all [CARDINAL] of those will be topics of conversation between the Chancellor and the President. And will the selection process for the next [ORG] head be part of the agenda? It is certainly possible. Again, I think the President has made clear what his view is, which is we support the timetable laid out by the [ORG] and we support the selection of the most qualified nominee. Do you expect them to talk about [PERSON] candidacy, specifically? Not that I am aware of that they would speak about a specific candidacy, but I do not want to rule out what could be brought up. [CARDINAL] of the troops in [GPE] are not [NORP]. Is there a sense that the decision the President makes on a troop withdrawal will influence what allies do? And is there a fear that a precipitous withdrawal will take them out as well? Well, again, there is not going to be anything -- there is not going to be a precipitous withdrawal -- precipitous being an adjective that suggests haste that is not thought through, perhaps. And I think that the point has always been that this will be driven by a process that reviews the conditions on the ground, reviews the options presented by commanders on the ground through the Secretary of [ORG], and will be very -- as reflected in the decision originally to -- with the policy decision he made in [DATE] will be very deliberate and thought through. So I think we -- it is an international coalition. We work -- we coordinate with our allies and we will obviously inform our allies of our decision once it is made. But I think that the kind of cooperation we have had there will continue. And given that the last combat troops are scheduled to leave in [DATE], in the context of a [DATE]-long war, this is not a huge window. So talk about why this first [DATE] drawdown is so significant, given that [CARDINAL] of troops will be out by [DATE] regardless. Well, it is the beginning of a process. It is important to remember that when the President came into office, there were a certain number of troops and he has increased them significantly because of his focus on the need to disrupt, dismantle, and ultimately defeat [ORG] where [ORG] central was located, in the AfPak region. That is where the attacks on 9/11 emanated from and obviously, as we discovered not that long ago, the region where [PERSON] himself was hiding. So he followed through on his commitment that he made in his campaign to refocus our attention on the original fight here, the fight that was so important, and we now have, because of the surge, so-called surge, reached a troop level that is allowing us -- has allowed us to make important progress in terms of stabilizing [GPE] and beginning the process of transferring security lead over to the [NORP] security forces. We are now at a point, as envisioned by the President's policy, where we can begin the drawdown. And the pace and slope will depend on conditions on the ground, but it will begin. And I take your point, but obviously how that is spaced out [DATE] will -- there is some room to decide what that slope looks like. And that is -- this is the first of those decisions. On that slope, the recommendation that the President gets, does he expect it to be more than just a [DATE] number? How much of the glide slope will be outlined in this recommendation? And if it is not fairly specific, do you revisit this [DATE] in the [DATE] updates on how many troops we could bring back and when? Well, without anticipating or boxing in Secretary [PERSON] or General [PERSON], I think that obviously this will be a proposal that looks at the situation we have now and envisions what the situation will be going forward. But as has always been the case, the process will be revisited according to what is happening on the ground. I mean, I think it would be foolish to say that a certain portion will come out [DATE] and a certain portion on [DATE]. I think that the answer is yes and no. Is there middle ground, though, I wonder, in the sense that you -- we know where you want to be in [DATE]. You might not be able to put exact numbers to exact dates, but will there be certain mileposts you set down [DATE] now that you can revisit based on -- Not that I can announce from now. I will leave that to the President to announce what decision he makes when he makes it. Again, we are still premature here because he has not even been given a formal recommendation by the Secretary of [ORG] on this. So to anticipate how that will look I think would be foolhardy on my part. In thinking about how he will convey this to the [NORP] people, do you think he will speak -- sort of review his policy and look forward over [DATE] at all? Again, I think we are getting ahead of the process here. I am sure he will convey it. Suggestions for how and the format are way ahead of where we are right now. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED1]. Can I go back to [PERSON]'s question about [PERSON]? You said you thought that [ORG] did everything possible to push this nomination forward. Can you just outline what all you did do? I mean, did the President pick up the phone and call Mr. [PERSON]? Did he -- I do not have a tick-tock on the different actions that different members of the administration took in support of this nomination. We strongly supported it. We thought he was highly qualified. We regret that it is come to this and he is withdrawn his nomination for understandable reasons. Again, he had -- enjoys significant bipartisan support, as he should have, given his qualifications. And we think that the suggestion that he is somehow not qualified is just ridiculous because he is so qualified for this job. And more broadly, it is just -- it is important for us to move forward in this process because these posts need to be filled precisely because we have such important issues before us in dealing with the economy. And so we look forward to working with [ORG], working with the [ORG], to get the nominee who replaces Mr. [PERSON] confirmed and other nominations that are still pending confirmed. What kind of message, though, does this send to other potential nominees? Well, I hope it is isolated. I hope that the process can move forward. And it is not -- I am not suggesting that it is uniform. We have had obviously some nominees move forward and we appreciate that and we'd like to see others move forward. Yes, [INTERVIEWED1], [CARDINAL] questions on do not ask, do not tell. Under the repeal law that President [PERSON] signed in [DATE], do not ask, do not tell will not be off the books until [DATE] pass following certification from the President, the [ORG] Secretary, and the chairman of [ORG]. A lot of people who worked to pass the repeal legislation [DATE] are becoming worried if that certification does not take place before [DATE], after [DATE], Secretary [PERSON] retires, that there could be additional delays as we wait for [PERSON] to come into position. So does the President want to see certification for do not ask, do not tell [DATE]? I mean, I think the process is moving at the pace that we anticipated, and I also think that it is the President's policy and that it will be implemented regardless of who is Secretary of [ORG]. But the President -- the administration is surely concerned that if we wait until [PERSON] comes in there could be additional delays -- We do not share that concern, no. [INTERVIEWED1], could you talk to us about the official relationship now with the [GPE] government and the [ORG]? Secretary [PERSON] made some statements over [DATE], and if you could kind of flesh that out for us -- Well, I am not -- you'd have to be more specific about what kind of statements he made. He was talking -- at the Asian Security Conference, he was talking about how in time we could work together, and things of that nature; there will be a relationship with the [GPE] government and the [ORG]. Could you talk -- give us any kind of information on that as the President is looking to draw down troops and bring everyone home by -- I think what this refers to is our oft-stated support for the reconciliation process that President [PERSON] has begun. The important contingencies -- or rather, the conditions of reconciliation -- not contingencies but conditions -- are renouncing violence, renouncing terrorism, laying down your arms, and abiding by the [NORP] constitution. So obviously there has to be a political settlement in [GPE], and obviously that would have to include elements of the [ORG]. And we support that process. Now, if at some future date when there is, we hope, relative peace in [GPE] and there is been a robust and successful reconciliation effort, the people who used to be members of the [ORG] who are now reconciled into the [NORP] government, and we have a relationship with the [NORP] government, then obviously that would include elements of the [ORG] from the past. But again, the process for getting to reconciliation is not simply saying, I'd like to reconcile. And going back to what you just said, elements of the [ORG] from the past, there is a history there. And I mean, are we at this point able to trust, to trust whatever the [ORG] says and does? Well, there is an important thing to make sure is clear here, which is this is a process that is being undertaken by President [PERSON], who is President of the country and believes that reconciliation is essential for a long-term solution in [GPE]. We support him in that and agree with him. There obviously are irreconcilable elements, and we are taking the fight in [GPE] to those elements, and have made progress and halted the [ORG]'s momentum. But going forward, reconciliation has to be a part of [GPE]'s future, and we support that process. When the President plays golf with the Speaker, will you ask them to let the pool see them tee off? I could ask. I do not have anything for you on the press circumstances surrounding that event as of yet. As you know, the President has not been completely -- It is way off in the future. -- transparent about his golf game or let the pool see him start or finish. I think the President enjoys playing golf on occasion in part because it is a nice break. There are not that many opportunities that a President gets to get outside and be away from the trappings of office. But in terms of the specific golf date that you mentioned, I do not have anything for you yet on how we are going to cover that. [INTERVIEWED1], first of all, is that your swing that you were showing us -- I am a terrible golfer, yes. I was hoping you could tell us a little bit -- considering the national security challenges that are on the President's plate right now -- [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], et cetera, you know the list -- and what we saw [DATE] in terms of the economic recovery slowing down, could you talk to us a little bit in terms of how he is balancing these [CARDINAL]? You do not really have much of a choice when you become President. These are the [CARDINAL] priorities you are handed, and for good reason: the national security of [GPE], protecting the people of [GPE] at home and abroad, and the economic vitality, growth, and job creation of the nation. And these are the [CARDINAL] priorities that the President focuses on [DATE]. And these are complicated times, and obviously when he took office, we were in economic freefall, and that was the focus, appropriately, of the media's attention, of the country's attention, and the President's attention. But it is often lost -- or we forget sometimes that he also when he came into office inherited [CARDINAL] wars that he had to spend a lot of time thinking about in terms of fulfilling his promise to draw down and end -- draw down troops and end the war in [GPE], a promise that he is keeping; and also the promises he made about how to successfully prosecute our effort in [GPE], another promise that he is keeping. And these are -- you cannot -- you do not have a choice. You have to do both, and that is just a reality of the office. And it is why it is such an important one. Just a quick follow-up. I feel like I missed this over the course of [DATE] -- I might have been on vacation or something -- but when did the President stop doing the [DATE] presidential economic daily briefing? I think it happens periodically -- But it used to be a [DATE] thing with the PDB. I am just curious when it stopped being a [DATE] thing. I will have to go check. Again, it sort of happens occasionally, does not happen all the time. And I think that was always the case, but I can check. I do not have any scheduling changes to announce, but -- [DATE] an [ORG] spokesperson released a video statement saying something to the extent of a good way to get access to firearms is through gun show loopholes in [GPE]. And I am wondering how serious [ORG] is taking this statement, and also if they have directed [ORG] to look into the matter. And how do gun control policies stand -- I am sorry, gun control policy talks stand with the administration? I know there was a task force that convened at [ORG] a little while ago, but we have not heard an update since then. I honestly am not aware of the statement that you mentioned, [PERSON]. And I would encourage you to go to [ORG] on it. We are very mindful of any threats emanating from [ORG] and take them seriously, so I am sure that the appropriate folks are aware of it and acting on it. But I will have to send you to [ORG] for that. Yes, ma'am, in the green. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED1]. The President is playing golf; do you have his -- what is his handicap? What is his handicap? Yes. That is classified. I cannot -- Please. Is [PERSON] giving him strokes? We have not -- I do not think any of that has been worked out. Again, I think this is just an opportunity for the [CARDINAL] men to spend some time together. As the President has said, and I think the Speaker probably shares this opinion, that this is useful and valuable because they obviously both have a lot of responsibility for the kinds of decisions that need to be made in this country on behalf of the [NORP] people. So the fact that they can spend [TIME] together playing golf I think is absolutely a good thing. And how that game goes, we will just have to see. Will it be a foursome? I do not have anything on who else will be playing. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED1]. On the debt ceiling, for the rest of the world, it is very difficult to understand what is going on in [GPE] because most of the country do not have those system, and for the rest of the world, it seems to be another political battle in [GPE]. But this one is different in nature because this one put the entire international financial community in danger if [ORG] could default. Right. So what is your message for the international community? And are you confident that you can resolve the issue by [DATE]? We are confident that [ORG] will vote to raise the debt ceiling. We believe that members of [ORG] have heard about the imperative here not just from us but from a variety of places and that that message is getting through; and it is one that is been expressed by leaders of [ORG] of both parties. And to your point, [PERSON], it is not just the international financial community that would be adversely affected by a default. Everyone in this country would be adversely affected by a default. The consequences for the economy would be very serious, very grave, and that would affect growth. It would affect jobs. It would affect retirement accounts. It would affect every single [NORP]. And to your point in terms of the global impact, it would affect people around the world. And that is why it is so important to take this vote. It is a different circumstance than exists in a lot of countries. What people need to understand is that this vote, which is always one that the [ORG] is resistant to taking for understandable reasons, is to lift the debt ceiling in order to pay the obligations that the government has already made. This is not a decision to spend money. This is a decision to honor the obligations already made by the [GPE] government, by the [ORG], by administrations of both parties. And it has to be done because defaulting on our obligations, defaulting on the full faith and credit of the [GPE] government would be a terrible, terrible idea with unpredictable consequences. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED1]. Thank you, all.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingprincipaldeputypresssecretaryjoshearnest", "text": "Is that here in [GPE]? That is here in [GPE], D.C. So with that, we will wade in to taking a few questions. Mr. [PERSON], would you like to take us off? Thanks, [INTERVIEWED1]. Is [PERSON] out here for you, or are we going to see your -- -- be paying attention to the whole briefing [DATE]. We are not expecting the President out here? I do not expect that he is going to. That would be a way to really kick off the first one, though, would not it? Especially after the understudy stuff, right? I know. I know. [CARDINAL] topics. On [GPE], the President's apology of the burning of the [NORP] has not seemed to quell the violence, the protests at all. I believe that now [CARDINAL] people have been killed. I am wondering if [ORG] is worried that there is no clear end in sight to this. Well, as you pointed out, [PERSON], General [PERSON], Secretary [PERSON], and President [PERSON] have all, in different forms, expressed their apology on behalf of the [NORP] people and the [NORP] military to the [NORP] people to articulate that the [GPE] military and, indeed, the [NORP] people have enduring respect for the religious views and religious practices of the [NORP] people. We were pleased [DATE] to see that President [PERSON] himself has also called -- or appealed for calm in [GPE]. And while this is a difficult circumstance that we are working through, we are confident that our goals in [GPE] -- which I will remind you is to defeat, disrupt and dismantle [ORG] and to ensure that [GPE] be used as a safe haven for [ORG] or other religious extremists -- violent extremists -- so it is our view that we will work through these difficult circumstances and remain on track to making progress on our goals there. Is there anything else -- as this incident continues, is there anything else the President can do or plans to do that you know of? Nothing that I have to announce at this time. Speaking of no end in sight, on a much broader scale, of course, as you know, the slaughter in [GPE] continues. Secretary [PERSON], at the conference in [GPE], said that the regime will have more blood on its hands if it does not comply with the cease-fire. And I am wondering what [ORG] thinking is about what happens if it does not . Is there any thought being given right now that you can help us understand about what happens next? Well, as you point out, [PERSON], Secretary [PERSON] is in [GPE] right now meeting with the [ORG] group in [GPE] to talk about a number of things, including a political transition in [GPE]. They are also talking about the need to find a way to deliver humanitarian aid and medical supplies to areas like [GPE] and other areas of [GPE] where [NORP] citizens -- innocent [NORP] citizens -- have been heinously attacked by the [PERSON] regime. So the question you are raising is a question that is being actively discussed by [GPE], our allies, partners, and even other countries in the region, about the way forward in that country, about what we can do to facilitate a political transition there. It is the collective view of all of the nations who are participating in that conference that there are [CARDINAL] important things that we need to do. The first is, it is important for us to continue to increase the international pressure on the [PERSON] regime, to isolate further the [PERSON] regime, to ensure that we are working in an integrated, coordinated fashion to apply the sanctions for maximum effect. It is also the collective belief of the people who are participating in that conference that a political transition will take place that ends with the [PERSON] regime no longer being in power in [GPE]. That is a foregone conclusion, and it is one that the international community is working together to achieve. But you say it is a foregone conclusion, and I know that [ORG] has said that for some time now, but in the meantime, people are dying by [DATE] including children. Is there a point at which the President's patience simply runs out? Certainly the images that we are seeing on television are appalling. The violence that is being perpetrated by the [PERSON] regime, as you point out, against innocent civilians -- men, women and children -- is outrageous. It is something for which we have [CARDINAL] patience. That is why you are seeing a coordinated international effort to get it to stop, to bring some humanitarian relief, and to ensure a prompt political transition in [GPE]. Last one on this. Is there any update you can give us about the deliberations on arming the rebels? I do not have an update to our position on this. As you have heard [PERSON] and others say, it is our view that further militarization in [GPE] at this point in time is not a wise -- is not the policy that we believe is the wise one to pursue at this point. [INTERVIEWED1], I'd like to ask you about the [ORG]. [TIME], [ORG] Secretary [PERSON] said that the United States will continue to evaluate use of the SPR. But what are the criteria that you are using to evaluate tapping the SPR, and how are you making that decision? And the follow-up would be, if you could describe the process that you will use to make the decision -- who is involved, how that will take place. I appreciate the question. I did see Secretary [PERSON]'s interview on [ORG] [TIME]. Like Secretary [PERSON], I am not going to speculate about any policy outcomes that may or may not be contemplated by this administration at this point. So I do not have anything on that for you. What I can tell you is that the President will continue to pursue, as he talked about at some length [DATE], an all-of-the-above approach to our energy challenges. So that includes a wide range of options. We are not taking anything off the table. But I am not going to speculate about what kinds of things may or may not be on the table, or how we are going to make decisions about what is on the table. You cannot say anything about what criteria will be used to make the decision? I cannot. I cannot. Thanks. [INTERVIEWED1], I am going to ask you a couple questions on the President's conversations of late. Has the President -- [CARDINAL], has the President been consulting with the [NORP] leadership in this country about what is been going on with [GPE] and the disposal of the [NORP]? I do not have any meetings to read out to you on that front, [DATE]. There are officials at [ORG] who work in [ORG], who are responsible for reaching out to people all across the country -- and certainly faith leaders fall in that category. But I do not have any specific meetings on this specific topic to read out to you. Is [ORG] possibly reaching out as well? You'd have to ask them to check, and I can check on that for you if you'd like. But I do not -- to be honest with you, I do not know. And also, on the gas price issue, what is the President saying to [ORG]? And what are the conversations around here like as gas prices are rising? For instance, [DATE] I was in [GPE] -- in [CARDINAL] day gas prices at a regular station went from $[MONEY] to $[MONEY] -- and that is in [DATE]. They are likely to see $[MONEY] quicker than many other parts of the country. What is this President doing and what is the conversations like? Well, the President, as he described [DATE], is certainly concerned about the impact that rising gas prices is having on family budgets all across the country, where family -- as we have discussed, [DATE] throughout the President's [DATE] in office -- this is a difficult time for middle-class families in this country, and the rising gas prices only adds to that burden. That is certainly [CARDINAL] reason why it is so important that [ORG] passed a payroll tax cut extension that will put an average of $[MONEY] per paycheck back in the pockets of the average [NORP] family's budget. That certainly is an important step to offering a little bit of a financial cushion to those families. But what the President is doing, broadly, is pursuing an all-of-the-above approach when it comes to energy in this country; that we have taken a number of steps related to oil and gas production in this country. The President has recently announced an agreement with the nation of [GPE] to explore and develop oil and gas reserves along the boundary in the Gulf of Mexico between our [CARDINAL] countries. The President -- or [ORG] recently announced steps toward additional drilling -- or further drilling in the Arctic Ocean around [GPE]. The President has recently also asked his -- or directed [ORG] to ensure that [PERCENT] of the recoverable oil reserves are being developed. So there are number of steps related to drilling and production. And those steps have actually yielded a benefit, which is that [DATE] that this President has been in office we have seen an increase in oil and gas production. But what that also illustrates is that if your answer to this challenge of rising gas prices is just drilling for oil, you are not going to find a very good answer, because an all-above -- all-of-the-above approach is required. So that also is why the President is pursuing a range of other things -- investments in biofuels and renewable energy, wind and solar. The administration is backing the first -- the construction of the first nuclear power plant in this country in [DATE]. So there are a range of things that the President is doing, and he is doing that because he is concerned about the energy challenges facing this country and our economy. Visions of the future, long-term approach -- people are saying, great. But when it comes down to the possibility of putting $[MONEY] a [MONEY], that is in need of a short-term approach. Is the President looking at the possibility of tapping into the oil -- the strategic oil reserves. Well, your colleague at [ORG] asked me the same question. I am not going to speculate about any sorts of discussions that may or may not be taking place related to [FAC]. I am just not going to do that. But what I can tell you is that there are plenty of people involved in the political process who are willing to make phony promises about what they can do to address rising gas prices -- that if -- and I can tell you that they are empty promises. That if there were a magic wand that you could wave, [CARDINAL] of the previous Presidents would have waved it. Right? This is something that this country has been dealing with for [DATE]. So if -- We have never seen $[MONEY]. We have seen $[MONEY]. Now we are going into the possibility of $[MONEY]. Sure, but we have seen gas price spikes that have had a significant impact on our economy and have significantly stretched the budgets of middle-class families all across the country. That is not a new phenomenon. And if somebody is going to promise that they can wave a magic wand or sprinkle the pixie dust or plant the beans in the right place so that we can get out of this problem, they are just not being straight with you and they are not being straight with the [NORP] people. So it is the view of this administration, and it is the view of this President, that we need to constructively pursue an all-of-the-above approach when it comes to energy. So that means taking advantage of domestic oil and gas production in this country. It means important investments in renewable energy, like wind and solar and biofuels. It means the President's success in negotiating a historic fuel-efficiency standards rule that would raise fuel-efficiency standards in this country -- that would ensure that we are essentially doubling fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks. And what that means, when you double the fuel efficiency, it means that you have to go to the gas station [CARDINAL] as often, [CARDINAL] as frequently. So if you go once a week now, you are only going once [DATE]. This will have a significant impact on our reliance on foreign oil, but also it will have a significant impact on the budgets of families all across the country. So this is -- these are difficult policy challenges, and anybody who says that there is an easy answer to doing something about it right away is just not telling the truth. All that sounds great, but if the President was willing to tap the [ORG] [DATE], at [DATE], why would not he be willing to do so [DATE] in what happens to be [DATE]? Well, principally because the President is not making these decisions based on the fact that we are in the middle of a political season. The President is making these decisions based on the best interests of the country and the best interests of our economy, and the best interests of middle-class families that are weathering the storm of a spike in oil and gas prices. A lot of middle-class families might feel it was in their best interest to have cheaper gas. Well, that is the point of this discussion, right? That we need an all-of-the-above approach to energy in this country. And that is the only way we are going to be able to do something real about securing energy independence for this country. Here is why that is important. The price of gas, the spike in the price of gas is related to the spike in the global oil market. The impact of the global oil market is significantly outside the ability of anybody inside [GPE] to influence prices at that level. So the global oil market is influenced by the fact that in [GPE], [CARDINAL] new cars were added to the roads in [GPE] in [DATE]. That has added to the demand in the global oil market. We are seeing a booming economy in [GPE], where there is an increasing demand for oil in [GPE] -- that is affecting the price of oil in the global oil market. We are seeing a stronger economy in [GPE], where the demand for oil and gas in [GPE] has significantly increased -- that is affecting the global oil market. The key here to solving this problem over the long term and making sure that we do not have to deal with these challenges moving forward, that we are not susceptible to the spikes and declines in the global oil market, is to make [GPE] finally independent of foreign energy. And that is the course that the President's pursuing. Sure, but why not in the short term, too? Well, as I pointed out, in the short term, what the President has pursued was a payroll tax cut that would put $[MONEY] in the pocket of every working -- of the average [NORP] family [DATE]. That is the kind of thing that is going to help [NORP] families deal with the spike in gas prices. But anybody who says that they can wave a wand or plant the magic beans to lead to a reduction in oil prices is just not telling the truth. Well, he can wave a wand and release some from the SPR. [PERSON]. The President ran a lot of commercials in [DATE] about gas prices. It was a big part of his reelection campaign. So I do not understand -- there seems to be a tone of indignance from [ORG] about the fact that people are talking about gas prices. This is one of the reasons why you guys have your jobs. If I am showing a sign of indignance, it may be because I am a little nervous in my first time. I am not trying to demonstrate that there is some indignance up here. I think -- I actually meant the President. I appreciate that. It is very generous of you. Certainly the future of energy production in this country, certainly the challenges that is posed by a volatile oil -- global oil market, those are legitimate -- how to confront those challenges is worthy of a policy debate. There is a legitimate debate we can have about how to address those challenges. It is not legitimate to suggest that you can wave a magic wand and solve those problems right away. What is legitimate is for us to have a debate about what kind of policy we should pursue. There are some who say we should have -- as the President alluded to [DATE] -- a [CARDINAL]-step approach to dealing with oil prices in this country, which is -- step [CARDINAL] is we should drill, the second step is that we should drill some more, and the third step is that we should keep drilling. It is the President's view that we cannot drill our way out of this problem, that we need to avail ourselves of a wide range of options, all of which the President is pursuing. And that is something that the President campaigned on extensively as a candidate for President in [DATE], and is an example of the President making good on those promises. How is he making good if gas prices are going to be higher [DATE], potentially, than ever before? Well, because the promise that he was talking about was making [GPE] independent of foreign oil. And certainly the historic agreement on fuel efficiency standards that the President reached with a range of stakeholders and the auto industry will do more to accomplish that goal than any other recent policy announcement. And in some ways, by many other measures, it is one of the most important accomplishments of this administration, which is that we can significantly reduce our reliance on foreign oil because of those increased standards. It will also -- it will reduce our reliance on foreign oil by [QUANTITY] of oil, and it will actually lower fuel costs for families and businesses in this country by [MONEY] with a t . So that is [CARDINAL] example of a substantive difference that the President's policies have made and will make into the future. Many of the benefits of that policy are yet to be enjoyed, but we are on track to get that done. Also I'd like to follow up on a question from [PERSON] about the apology that President [PERSON] -- the apology letter to President [PERSON]. That is also emerged as an issue that [NORP] have criticized the President on. Without getting into their charges, can you walk us through the process and decision-making when it comes to issuing an apology? What concerns are taken into account? When is it thought that something rises to the level of needing an apology? When is something not? When is there a concern that that is probably too much, or [GPE] does not need to be too apologetic about such-and-such? I mean, how is a decision made to do such a thing? Is it only the lives of people protesting in the street, or the [GPE] service members that are taken into account? This is a difficult thing to discuss in a hypothetical context, but I can talk about this specific context. Okay. And it was the President's view that an apology was appropriate because he is putting the best interest and safety and welfare of our service members and our civilians who are currently serving in [GPE] right now -- that we have seen a spike in violence around this mistake. And the President believed that it was in the best interests of their safety to make it clear that an apology was appropriate, and that the [NORP] people and the [NORP] military in particular does have respect for the religious views and the religious practices of the [NORP] people. So in this case, the President believed it was in the best interests and in -- of safety for [NORP] servicemen and women in [GPE], and for the civilians that are serving in [GPE]. There have been other incidents in [DATE] involving [GPE] service members doing things that the [GPE] military, the [ORG] expressed regret over. When does it -- who advises the President that something rises to the level of needing an apology from him, as opposed to General [PERSON] or [PERSON] or whomever? Well, it is hard for me to speak to those range of issues. I can tell you that the President obviously consults with his national security team and with the military; certainly General [PERSON] is prominent in those kinds of discussions. But I would tell you that I cannot imagine -- I obviously was not here in [DATE], when President [PERSON] issued a similar apology after there was an [NORP] serviceman who had damaged a religious document of some kind. Was it the sniper? I believe that is correct. So my guess is that those kinds of discussions are not altogether different, that I think President [PERSON] was making -- reaching the same calculation, which is that it would be in the best interests of the safety and welfare of our [NORP] servicemen and women to issue an apology and make it clear that those actions were unintentional. And that is clear in this case, too. Yes. My understanding is that there is now some training of the service members in terms of how to deal with this kind of situation -- disposal of the Koran, respect for holy books, things like that -- for service members serving in [GPE]. Why has this not been done before? We have been there for [DATE] now, and we have had this sort of situation previously with burning of [NORP]. It is my understanding that there are some new training methods that are being put in place. I do not have any details about what those training methods are, though, so I'd refer you to [ORG] for that. But why has it not been in place before? And are you also confident that the kind of cultural training that is in place for service members is sufficient? Well, again, I cannot speak to the training standards that were in place before and in place now. For those kinds of details you are just going to have to check with my colleagues over at [ORG]. The classified report that came out from [ORG] [DATE] that talked about the uptick in attacks by [NORP] soldiers on [ORG] soldiers talked about how most of those attacks were as a result of personal issues, feeling that the [ORG] soldiers -- in particular the [GPE] soldiers -- were disrespecting their culture. Do we have a cultural disconnect here? Well, I have not seen the report that you are referencing, [PERSON]. But the issue that you are raising is precisely the reason that the President himself -- and General [PERSON], and Secretary [PERSON] -- have made clear to President [PERSON] and to the [NORP] people that the actions that took place at [FAC] do not reflect the official [GPE] policy and flagged that they were a mistake. And it was important in the view of General [PERSON], Secretary [PERSON] and President [PERSON] to make sure that that was clear to the [NORP] people. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED1]. President [PERSON] [DATE] claimed credit for domestic oil production being at an [DATE] high. But many independent energy analysts say that because of the lag time between lease and production, he cannot accurately claim credit, and a lot of the credit should go to the [PERSON] administration. Does the President think that his energy policies are responsible for that high? The President believes that it was important for this country to put in place an all-of-the-above approach when it comes to energy. That all-of-the-above approach includes many things that the President talked about on the campaign trail extensively -- investments in renewable energy, investments in biofuels, investments in nuclear technology including the construction of the first nuclear power plant in [GPE] in [DATE], and including expanded domestic oil and gas production. It is simply a fact that [DATE] that President [PERSON] has been in office, that oil and gas production has increased [DATE]. And our imports of oil and gas have declined [DATE]. I will let all of you in this room assess who deserves the credit and who deserves the blame, but at the end of the day, the facts are the facts. And there have been some who have suggested that that -- who have contested those facts, who have suggest somehow that this President has curtailed production. That is just not true. That is not what the numbers bear out. And so the President was merely underscoring the fact that production has increased while he is been in office, and it has done so because it is part of the all-of-the-above approach to energy that the President is pursuing. So he is not claiming credit? Is that just -- he is saying that under -- he said under my administration -- I think what the President was doing was he was being very specific about the circumstances that we find ourselves in, which is that oil and -- So is it semantics? He is not claiming credit? I think you are the one that is sort of injecting semantics here. What I am suggesting, and what the President is suggesting -- are you not? You are the one that raised the issue of credit or blame. I am not suggesting that. I am merely restating what the facts are. He said [DATE] under my administration, and he talked about the high in domestic oil production, which would be an indication that he is sort of -- I mean, I think it is pretty logical -- it is not a huge cognitive leap, right, to say that he is sort of saying that under -- It is also not a huge cognitive leap to suggest that the President was merely using the opportunity of his speech at [ORG] to talk about what kind of policy he is pursuing and what impact that has had on this country, and our progress toward becoming independent of foreign oil. But he was talking specifically about domestic oil production. I am just asking -- He was talking about domestic oil production. That is correct. So then, dissecting what he said aside, does he think that his policies on domestic oil are responsible for that [DATE] high or for the fact that there is this trajectory in domestic oil production? Well, I have not really contemplated sort of the -- as I pointed out when I sort of first attempted to answer your question, I have not really contemplated the credit or blame thing. There are certainly plenty of people on the outside who are attempting to assign credit or blame in different areas -- assigning that credit or blame without proper recognition of the facts. The facts are what they are, which is that oil and gas production under this President has increased [DATE] that he is been in office. I will leave it to you to decide whether or not the President deserves credit or blame for that. Also under this President's leadership -- Well, I am asking if the President thinks he deserves credit. I think what the President believes is that he deserves credit for pursuing an all-of-the-above approach to dealing with our energy challenges. So that certainly means -- includes increasing production every single year that he is been in office. It includes the important investments that we have made in renewable energy and biofuels. It certainly includes the historic agreement with the automakers to make fuel-efficiency standards much stronger -- to double fuel-efficiency standards so that we can save consumers and businesses [MONEY] at the pump. It certainly includes the construction of a new nuclear power plant in [GPE] for the first time in [DATE]. It includes all of those things. On the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, I know you are not going to say -- -- not making an announcement [DATE] -- Am I not being subtle about it? Yes, but does the administration think that releasing oil from the [FAC] could help affect gas prices? That is a hypothetical related to [FAC], and I am just not in a position to get into that right now. That is not a hypothetical. Could it happen or could it not? I am just not in a position to -- Could it help -- I am not in a position to address that question. You are getting indignant again. Am I? Somebody calm me down. A magic bean? Exactly. I need a magic bean, maybe. Sprinkle them around. Again, was not talking about you. To follow up on [PERSON]'s -- the substance on the Koran burning. Since you laid out the criteria where the President decides when he thinks the [GPE] government should apologize, is the President seeking an apology from President [PERSON] for the fact that [GPE] service personnel were killed because of this? The President is certainly gratified that President [PERSON] has appealed for calm in [GPE], as we work through what is a very challenging situation. At the end of the day, what the President and his national security team and our generals in [GPE] are focused on is making sure that we accomplish our goals in [GPE]. There is no doubt that we are working through a difficult situation there. But we are going to stay on track of accomplishing our goal and continuing to make the significant progress that we have made in ensuring that [GPE] cannot be a safe haven for [ORG] or other violent extremists. In the [ORG] interview, the President said, when asked about immigration reform, My presidency is not over. I have got [DATE] coming up. Specifically said, I have got [DATE], like it is a done deal. Do you run the risk there of looking like you are taking the election for granted, that the President is assuming he is going to win? No. The President is confident that when we get to a vigorous debate with his [NORP] opponent about whose vision is best for the future of this country, about which person will be a President over the course of [DATE] to put in place the kinds of economic policies that will ensure middle-class families get a fair shot and a fair shake and that everybody is playing by the same rules, that when we compare the President's vision for achieving an economy in a country that fulfills those values, that he is going to win. Now, the President, none of my colleagues in [GPE], nobody that works in this building, is under the illusion that it is going to be an easy election; that there will be a time and a place for a vigorous debate, and a competitive election that is good for the democratic process. It is one that the President and his campaign team will be engaged in, but at the end of the day, the President is confident that he will be successful. How is he so confident, given the fact that your friend [PERSON] keeps saying here at the podium that the President not watching the debates, he is not focused on the campaign, he spends [PERCENT] of his time on that? How has he made that judgment? Well, I think something that [PERSON] has said many times and something that I will tell you now is that even if the President is not watching the debates live, he certainly is following the race. And at the end of the day, the reason that the President is confident is not because of anything that the [NORP] candidates are saying. It is because of the vision for the country that he wants to put forward to the [NORP] people. He feels that his approach for the economy in terms of standing up for the middle class and giving -- ensuring that middle-class families all across the country get a fair shot and a fair shake, and that everybody in this country is playing by the same rules, that that is a vision that the [NORP] people have responded to, and will respond to when we get into the context of a political debate. At the end of the day, though, we are not there yet. There is still a vigorous [NORP] primary that is ongoing. I know that there is a big election on [DATE]. Again, this is all good for the democratic process. The President himself will turn more attention to his own candidacy once there is a [NORP] candidate in place, and once there is more of an opportunity to compare the President's vision for the future of this country with a [NORP] opponent. Last thing, on super PACs. After the President blessed the kind of [NORP] super PAC out there and said that his supporters could give money to that despite him not believing the [ORG] decision on it, [PERSON] just gave a [MONEY] check [TIME], as opposed -- we have seen [NORP] get way more, [MONEY] or so, from [PERSON]. My question is, the President has said he is not going to raise money for the super PAC but his [ORG] may. What is [ORG] going to do to disclose which [ORG] secretaries are raising money, which events they are appearing at, since this is kind of unchartered territory? That is a good question. I may have to get back to you on that. Certainly there are rules that we will follow related to the political activities of members of the President's Cabinet and senior members of the President's staff here at [ORG]. I do not have all the background on what those rules are. All I can do is assure you that the lawyers are familiar with those rules. They will ensure that those rules are followed. [INTERVIEWED1] -- [GPE]. [DATE], the then leader of [GPE], [PERSON], gave a speech. He said -- Of [GPE]. I am sorry, [GPE]. Said he was sending his troops to [GPE]; they were on their way. The rebels could hide in their bedrooms but they are going to be taken from their closets and killed. He never followed through on that threat, but the President repeatedly used that as a justification for military action, allied military action -- the no-fly and other action over the skies of [GPE]. [PERSON] has actually gone to people's homes and killed them. There is a massacre underway. So what is the difference? There are a couple of important differences, but I will start by restating something that I said a couple of times from this podium, but it would -- I would be remiss if I did not restate it -- which is that the violence that is being perpetrated by the [PERSON] regime against innocent civilians in [GPE] is appalling and should stop. It should end right away. That is not just the view of the President, but it is a view of a large number of countries around the world. As I mentioned earlier, those countries are currently meeting in [GPE] -- Secretary [PERSON] is representing [GPE] at that meeting -- to have conversations about what we can do try to bring some humanitarian aid and relief, to get some more medical supplies into communities like [GPE] and other areas of the country that have been under siege by the [PERSON] regime. At that meeting they are also discussing what they can do to ratchet up the pressure on [PERSON]. There are already pretty severe sanctions that are in place. But part of the discussions at that meeting will be integrating those sanctions to make sure that we are closely cooperating to maximize the impact of those sanctions. And we will also be talking about what is necessary to achieve a political transition in that country. So a wide range of these topics are being discussed at that meeting. In terms of what makes this different than [GPE], certainly the violence that is being perpetrated by the leaders of those [CARDINAL] countries is similar. But the other important difference, however, is that there was unanimity of opinion of [ORG] about military action in [GPE]. And that unanimity of opinion does not exist in relation to this situation. That is unfortunate. As you know, Ambassador [PERSON] and other [PERSON] administration officials were actively engaged in an effort to try to build international consensus. And that is something that we have had a large degree of success in doing -- that there are a number of -- I think there is something like [CARDINAL] countries that are represented at this meeting in [GPE]. So there is a broad international agreement about the way forward in [GPE], about the fact that [PERSON] should cease and desist his violence against innocent civilians; that the aspirations of the [NORP] people should be realized; that humanitarian aid should be brought there and that [PERSON] should leave power in [GPE]. I have a follow-up on a completely different and more parochial issue. Okay. Does the President agree on a general -- in a general sense with the notion that [ORG] has to get leaner? And, specifically, does he agree -- or does he agree with the approach taken that some people in rural areas object to, and that is they -- that they are being inordinately asked to bear a greater burden by having their local post offices closed under the plan that was put forward [DATE]? The President has indeed put forward a plan -- and I believe it was contained in the budget -- about what we can do to stem some of the red ink that is flowing from [ORG], that there are some measures that can be taken to improve the financial condition of [ORG]. I will confess, however, I am not briefed up on the details of that proposal. -- [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] jobs, [CARDINAL] facilities. So there are -- so the President has put forward a plan. In terms of the specifics of the way in which that plan will be implemented, I will have to get back to you on that. Is the timing of the event on [DATE] with the [ORG] and talking about saving the auto industry related to the fact that that is [DATE] of the [NORP] [GPE] primary? I actually think that it is related to the fact that that is when the conference is being held in [GPE]. So I do think this is the circumstance. Well, so are you saying it is a coincidence? It appears to me to -- I guess you'd have to talk to the schedule that is dictated by the organizers of the convention. Well, [ORG] makes decision about where it is going to speak and when, and -- Well, we did not make the decision on which day the [ORG] would hold their conference. You did make a decision to accept this invitation. Sure. Sure. I am wondering if that decision to accept this invitation was related to the timing. No, the decision to speak to the [ORG] is related to, as I mentioned at the very top of the briefing, related to the President's interest in talking to [ORG] about the success of the President's policies, and the hard work of the men and women of the [NORP] auto industry have made in turning around that industry -- that for the first time in [DATE], we are seeing increasing profit share -- I am sorry -- increasing profits, increasing market share, and even jobs being created in the auto sector -- [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] jobs created in the auto sector in just [DATE]. So that is what the President is going to talk about, and that is why he is there to talk about it. [CARDINAL] other question. In response to the last question on [GPE], you said that the main difference between [GPE] and [GPE] was the lack of international consensus on [ORG] that we have this time. Does that mean that if that changed, and if [GPE] and [GPE] came around on this, that, therefore, military action would be a real possibility? So those of you who disagree about whether that was -- [PERSON]'s question was hypothetical, I think will agree with me that that one is a hypothetical. So I do not think I will weigh in on that one. Well, that is the implication of what you said, though, was that that was the difference and that is -- The implication is that it is a significant difference from the situation [ORG] -- when they confronted the challenges in [GPE] and when they are confronting the challenges in [GPE]. But in terms of what would be the policy process if that difference did not exist, I am not going to speculate at this point. The implication is waiting for unanimity before military action can be -- can go forward. Well, again, I do not want to engage in a hypothetical discussion about what we would or would not do if [GPE] and [GPE] were to change their votes on [ORG]. I am just not in a position to -- maybe I am not enough of a big thinker to go there. But I am not in a position to speculate about what would change if they were to change their votes. Certainly, if they are willing to change their votes, we would be pleased to see that. That would be a welcome development. We believe that the votes that they cast to veto that resolution were the wrong votes. So we certainly -- if they want to revisit those votes, we are more than open to that. Has there been any progress from the renewed contacts with [GPE] on the nuclear issue, the meetings going on in [GPE]? I have seen the reports of those meetings, but I do not have any readout or update on those meetings to give you at this point. What do you hope -- what does [ORG] hope it will lead to? Well, we certainly -- what we hope they will lead to eventually is for [NORP] to abandon their nuclear weapons program and abide by the international standards that so much of the rest of the world community follows. That is the eventual goal here. That certainly is the goal of our diplomatic efforts. It is the goal of the diplomatic efforts of the [CARDINAL]-party talks. But I do not have anything new to update you on in terms of the progress toward that goal. [INTERVIEWED1], just to I hope clarify this [GPE] issue [CARDINAL] more time. I think maybe the way to clarify this is to ask you sort of directly, does the administration now believe that military action might be warranted in the case of [GPE]? I do not want to speculate about what might be warranted in the future. What we have said on this issue is that further militarizing the situation in [GPE] at this point in time is not a wise course -- that is not the wise policy course to pursue at this point. What we are engaged in now with our partners and other countries in the region is an effort to see if there is things that we can do to bring humanitarian relief and aid to those who are affected by the violence, including medical supplies, to see if there are things that we can do to offer support to [ORG], to speed a democratic transition, a political solution in [GPE]; and to increase the pressure through sanctions on the [PERSON] regime. That is our posture at this point. And that is irrespective of the position of [GPE] and [GPE] and [ORG]? Further militarization you do not think is a good idea? Yes, but again, you are sort of alluding to this idea that what -- would things be different if they had cast a different vote on this issue, and I just am not in a position to speculate on that. [CARDINAL] more thing on this. Sure. On this issue of humanitarian aid, there is a proposal that was made by the former policy planning director at [ORG] in our paper [DATE] that [CARDINAL] thing that you could do to help in that regard is create zones that she calls no-kill zones that border [GPE] and other neighboring countries of [GPE], and have humanitarian corridors run into those zones. In order to do that, she says that you would have to arm [ORG] enough to allow them to secure these zones. Given what you have said about not wanting to arm the opposition at this point, is that not a proposal that you guys would consider? In terms of specific proposals, I do not want to get ahead of the conversations that are currently ongoing in [GPE], so I would not want to weigh in on a specific proposal or not. It is proposals like these that would allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid and medical supplies that involve the support of the [NORP] opposition -- these are the kinds of policy choices that are being evaluated at these meetings, and at this point I do not want to get ahead of those talks. [INTERVIEWED1], there is a new -- [GPE] -- there is a new [ORG] report that has some new concerns about the military dimension, as it calls it, of [GPE]'s nuclear program and also very specifically talks about a missing quantity of uranium that the [NORP] have yet to account for. Have you seen the report? Do you have any reaction to what is in it? [TIME] before I walked out here somebody told me about the report, so we are aware of the report and we are reviewing it, but I do not have any immediate reaction for you on it right now. You may check with our national security staff [TIME] [DATE] and if they have a specific readout or reaction, they can give it to you. Thank you very much, [INTERVIEWED1]. In [DATE], the President said that [GPE] donations to [ORG] were woefully inadequate and he supported a measure of [ORG] -- went along with appropriating [MONEY] more for the [ORG] from the [GPE] Recently Congressman [PERSON] has introduced legislation to rescind that vote and get the money that remains in the line of credit at the [ORG] back to [GPE] and apply it to the deficit. Does the administration have an opinion on that and does the administration consider -- will it consider any future request from the [ORG] for further funding? I am not able to comment on the legislation that you have cited that is been offered by Congresswoman [PERSON]. I am not familiar with it so I am not able to comment on that. In terms of further contributions to the [ORG], that question has previously been asked in the context of offering some financial stability and support to the eurozone region. What we have said previously -- we have said a couple of things previously, including as recently as [TIME] -- Secretary [PERSON] was talking about the [ORG] and referenced specifically the fact that it was important for there to be a firm [NORP] solution in place, a strong [NORP] firewall that would inspire the confidence of the international community and would inspire the confidence of the [ORG] to offer up additional support as needed. But the support or resources that would be offered by the [ORG] would not be a substitute for anything that the [ORG] countries would collectively do. And what also has been the previously articulated position of the administration is that we do not believe at this point that additional [NORP] resources into the [ORG] is something -- that is not something that is being considered right now. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED1]. It is off the table? That is correct. Thank you. The [PERSON] campaign has a little donation ad running on the Internet that is a picture of the President and his daughters and his wife. It appears to be a photo-shopped version of the official photograph that you all released in [DATE] showing the family in [FAC]. Does the campaign buy the rights to photographs from official [ORG] government photographs and video? Does it have free access to all government video and pictures taken of the President? I have not seen the email that you are referencing. It is not an email -- it is a little ad on the -- Oh, an ad. I assume -- it is a photo that is available on our [ORG] website? That is correct. And what we have found is that a whole lot of people who have access to the [ORG] website use these photos for a wide range of reasons -- whether to put them on their Facebook page, to send them to their friends because they think they are interesting -- But they cannot be used for commercial -- They cannot be used for commercial uses, that is true. But we have also seen a number of political campaigns, certainly in [DATE], that used [ORG] off the photo -- photos off the [ORG] website and incorporated them into their television advertisements and other advertisements. So does the [PERSON] campaign have free access to video like West Wing Week and any of the resources done at federal government -- It is a compliment I will take that they might be interested in -- obtaining that footage is a compliment. Photographs and video of the President taken at taxpayer expense -- are those freely used for the campaign, which can be compared to a commercial enterprise -- it is seeking donations. my understanding about the way that that material that is publicly released is, is that with the exception -- with the commercial uses exception that you stipulated, that these are basically items in the public domain. So I will confirm with the lawyers and see if there is any more specific guidance that I can offer you on that, but that is my understanding of the situation. I will give you the last one. Thank you. Totally off this topic -- retired [NORP] businessman [PERSON] is on his way to a [GPE] jail [DATE] after he was extradited to [GPE] from [GPE] because he was illegally exploiting weapons parts to [GPE]. He denies it. He says it was part of a sting operation by [GPE] agents. Do you have any knowledge about this? I know that Secretary [PERSON] was asked this question [DATE], and I do not have anything beyond what she said. So I'd refer you her remarks. [DATE] ahead. [DATE] ahead. I almost forgot, but I do have one. [PERSON] assured me that I should not forget because he knew you would be asking. Oh, wait, wait, it is right here in the front. On [DATE], the President and First Lady will welcome [ORG] to [FAC] for the [DATE] Governors dinner. It says in my book here [DATE] and I assume that is a misprint. So we are editing on the fly here. The Vice President and Dr. [PERSON] will also attend. On [DATE], the President and the Vice President will host a meeting with [ORG] in [FAC]. On [DATE], the President will deliver remarks, as I mentioned, to the United Auto Workers Conference in [GPE], [GPE] On [DATE], as you have previously heard, the President and First Lady will host a dinner at [FAC] to honor our armed forces who served in [GPE] -- let me say that again -- our armed forces who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn to honor their families. This dinner, an expression of the nation's gratitude for the achievements and enormous sacrifices of the brave [NORP] who served in the Iraq war and of the families who supported them, will include men and women in uniform from all ranks, services, states and backgrounds, representative of [CARDINAL] of [NORP] who served in [GPE]. Do you know the press coverage on that? I do not , but we will work with you on figuring that out. On [DATE], the President will travel to [GPE], [GPE] and will deliver remarks on the economy. In [TIME], the President will attend campaign events in [GPE]. And finally, on [DATE], the President will end [DATE] by traveling to [ORG] in [GPE], [GPE] to visit wounded service members. That is [DATE]? That is on [DATE]. I do not have any updates on a possible presidential news conference for you, so in the meantime you will just have to satisfy yourself with hearing the answers from [PERSON] and me. So with that, thanks, everybody. Have [DATE].", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretaryrobertgibbs17", "text": "Thanks, [INTERVIEWED1]. A few follow-up questions on the meeting with lawmakers. On taxes, the President outlined this accelerated negotiation process to come up with some sensible common ground, as he called it. Did he suggest at all that he would be open to a temporary extension of the tax cuts for the wealthy? Did he lay any markers down at all? No, the -- I think both sides started and discussed where each had been on -- that our priority was ensuring that, as you heard the President say in his statement, that we make permanent tax cuts for the middle class that are set to expire at [DATE], and to reiterate our concern for borrowing [MONEY] over [DATE] in making tax cuts for those in excess of $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] permanent. I think the [NORP] restated their notion of making the wealthy tax cuts permanent. So the President wanted to -- as, again, you heard him say -- get to the process of having some of those discussions by asking Secretary [PERSON] and [ORG] Director [PERSON] to sit down with [CARDINAL] members or senators appointed by -- [CARDINAL] each -- by Senator [PERSON], Senator [PERSON], Speaker [PERSON] and Representative [PERSON]. And I anticipate that those conversations could happen [DATE] -- or start [DATE]. But you had -- it sounds like you started -- I am sorry, it sounds like you ended where you started with these broad philosophical differences about those tax cuts for the wealthy. So what gives the President confidence that this negotiation process is going to be productive? What I think was the foundation for this -- for, quite frankly, the whole meeting was we have to do -- we have to do things that ensure continued economic strengthening and job creation. We have to deal with our long-term -- with our short-term deficits and our long-term debt. And we have to ensure the safety and the security of the [NORP] people. So Secretary [PERSON] and [ORG] Director [PERSON] both said -- both gave very quick descriptions of sort of where we thought the economy was. And everybody, I think, as the President said, in the room agreed that this was an issue that we needed to get finished by [DATE], before the tax cuts expired. And that is the charge that he gave to [PERSON] and to [PERSON]. And I anticipate -- again, I anticipate they will meet relatively soon. A couple other quick ones, please. Senator [PERSON] said that his caucus was united on doing the tax issues and the appropriations issues in lame duck first, and then if there is time left getting to some of the other pressing matters. The President brought up START in his own description but did not seem to acknowledge any forward progress. Is [ORG] willing to take up that issue in [DATE] if need be? I think there was a robust discussion about how that could be done in a lame duck. I think you have heard senators even [DATE] discuss the likelihood of being able to get that done. Look, the tax issue may take a little bit. But the [ORG] and the [ORG] will be here. And I think we believe that that is an issue -- START is an issue that can get done [DATE]. You still think it is? Yes, absolutely. And, finally, on the broader issue of cooperation, I heard Representative [PERSON] and [PERSON] say, in their words, that the President -- I am paraphrasing -- the President acknowledged he had not reached out enough to them. Is that a fair portrayal? It is. I think the President acknowledged that he needed to do better and acknowledged that -- rightly that he would do his part. I think there was a -- there was common ground reached in the notion, again, as you heard the President say in his statement, that the [NORP] people did not vote for gridlock. They did not vote for the continual games that we see played in [GPE]. They voted for [CARDINAL] parties working together to get something done. That is going to take -- it is going to take just that, bipartisanship. And that is the only way we are going to make progress. And I think this meeting, which we -- which we set up, is the beginning of that. Yes, sir. [INTERVIEWED1], thanks very much. To come back to this idea of common ground on the tax cuts, specifically, what would [ORG] be willing to compromise on? For instance, would the President favor extending -- I was in the meeting, but the President did not tap me to be [CARDINAL] of those negotiators. So I am going to let [PERSON] and [PERSON] get into that as soon as we have the appointment of those members and senators from the designated leaders. And, again, I anticipate that they will begin talking as early as [DATE]. But does the President favor extending all the tax cuts for [DATE]? Well, again, the President's most urgent desire is to see that taxes do not go up on the middle class. And we are going to go from there. The President mentioned a possible meeting out at [FAC]. Is there a timeframe for that? And also a sense of who you'd invite -- would it just be restricted to lawmakers? Or could it be extended to the business community, for example? Well, I think that the meeting that the President talked about with -- and I should -- just for a second, let me step back and talk about a little bit of the structure of the meeting because I am going to speak about this, but I was not in this part of the meeting. The meeting lasted [TIME] -- probably [TIME]. [TIME] was the President and the Vice President and the members of the [ORG] and the [ORG], without staff, without Secretary [PERSON], without [ORG] Director [PERSON] in the private dining room right off of [FAC]. So in [TIME], the President -- that is where the President brought up the idea -- and they talked about it throughout the meeting, the idea of continuing these conversations, and threw out the hope that -- and I think it was agreed -- loosely agreed upon that sometime in [DATE], they would continue this meeting at [FAC]. Why did the President ask the staff to leave? Was it that they were no longer needed at that point? Did he want to have a more intimate conversation? I think to have a little bit more intimate conversation. And when you talked about the President telling [NORP], as they describe, that he had not done enough to reach out to them, did he offer an apology at all? No, he said that -- he took responsibility for that. And as I said, in order to have bipartisanship, we have to do this both ways. And the President is ready to do his part. I am still a bit confused about the divide that still exists on these tax cuts. If the President still thinks that [MONEY] is more than the country can afford, how can there be any compromise at all? And I know you do not want to negotiate this now, but it seems like the divide is so wide. Look, I am not going to enumerate -- I would not enumerate all the property lines, but I think it is safe to say that -- I think it is safe to say, the President reiterated, that the notion of a -- the notion of a permanent -- the notion of making permanent tax cuts for those on the upper end of our income scale, the predominance of which go to millionaires and billionaires, is not something that -- not something that making permanent would -- he does not believe would make sense. It is a [MONEY] expenditure over -- because we do these in a [DATE] budget window. So I think that is -- I think as he did in his statement -- enumerated where he is on that. The President is scheduled to leave for [GPE] [DATE]. Given this very lengthy agenda, what are the odds that he is going to have to delay -- [PERSON], I think it is largely unknowable, but the President will be here for as long as he needs to be here to get progress on and to make progress on the issues that are -- that he outlined in the meeting. You said the President in a way apologized or expressed regret for not reaching out enough. Did [NORP] offer any sort of apology? No, no. Not that I have in my notes. Does the President sense that there is compromise possible on these issues that [NORP] are willing to give? I think there was -- I think there was a sense in the room in discussing a whole host of issues the understanding on both sides -- let us take taxes -- that we -- there was an economic imperative to provide certainty before [DATE] when these cuts are scheduled to expire. The President also mentioned, as you heard him say in his statement, there are things like AMT, the college tax credit and other issues that are set to expire and will impact those at all income levels. So I think an agreement that we needed to get this solved by [DATE], and an agreement that we all have a responsibility to work together to make progress and that in order to do so we are going to be required to sit in the same room, have conversations and discussions like this and come to some common ground and agreement. And I think the President believes and I think -- without speaking for them but having read some of their comments after the meeting -- I think everyone thought it was a productive beginning in hopes of finding some of that common ground. [NORP] have expressed concern about the fact that Majority Leader [PERSON] has discussed bringing up the DREAM Act and do not ask, do not tell repeal that might eat up a lot of time that could be spent on the tax cuts or [ORG]. Does the President share their concern? Well, the President shares Senator [PERSON]'s concern -- or I should say the President shares Senator [PERSON]'s -- believes that it is also -- those are also issues that are important to the [NORP] people. And I do not -- I think we talked about this a little [DATE] -- I do not -- I think, again, I think the [ORG] is going to be -- this is -- the tax issues is not going to get solved in -- not likely to get solved [DATE]. The [ORG] is going to be here and there is time to do -- there is time to do the people's business. And I am not going to get into a long discussion about do not ask, do not tell because I think as many of you know, that very shortly Secretary [PERSON], Admiral [PERSON] and others are going to discuss the public release of the [ORG]'s review. But -- and we will have a statement from the President on what that review has found. But I think, in discussions that the President has had on this issue over [DATE], this is an issue that if we do not solve legislatively is going to get solved in the courts. And solving that issue in the courts is not going to provide the [ORG] with the type of orderly transition that they have said they need. But we have the pathway to do it legislatively, make progress, and I think the President -- obviously the President still wants to do that. So just to put a period on this, the President thinks that funding the government, passing unemployment insurance extensions, do not ask, do not tell repeal, the DREAM Act, tax cuts and START all can be done -- Yes. -- in [DATE]? Yes. Good luck. Yes. Well, thank you. You will have a lot to cover. You said that the President, and in fact, the President said that he acknowledged he had not reached out enough and would do his part. But you just told [PERSON] that the [NORP] did not make a similar statement. Does the President believe that they should have? Let me do this, [PERSON]. No, I do not -- look, I am not -- I have got my hands full being the spokesperson for the President. And, look, this was not something that was prompted. The President -- I think the President just laid out that in order for us to work together we are going to have to communicate better. We are going to have to reach out -- But he also said he had not reached out enough. Does he believe the [NORP] -- it is a [CARDINAL]-way street -- does he believe they have not reached out? I did not ask the President that. Again, I'd leave that up to others. The President was, I think, pretty clear about the fact that -- in acknowledging that he needed to and would do better. Even if they do not ? Well, again, I can only speak for the actions of what the President intends to do and what the President told leaders [DATE]. So his reaching out is not -- reaching out more is not contingent upon their returning the favor? His reaching out is contingent upon the fact that he is the President of [GPE] and in order to get things done in what will now be a divided government requires working with the other side. It sounds like he is willing to bend even if they do not . I do not -- the President is willing to have a better line of communication with [NORP] on [ORG] to get something done. I do not -- I am not sure I'd call that bending. I call that trying to work together. I think that is incidentally likely what the [NORP] people call it, too. Yes, and I do not want to get too much into semantics here, but you talk to people -- On common ground. I appreciate the -- yes. Self-criticism lesson? I think there is that sign that said, Last chance to not get into semantics. And we might have passed that [QUANTITY] ago. We never do that. We never parse words, either. But speaking of parsing words, you said that what [PERSON] and [PERSON] had been tasked with is finding common ground. Would it be accurate to say that they have been tasked with finding a compromise that can pass by [DATE]? Yes, yes. Okay. Just wanted to make sure. And on the tax issue, do you think there was a breakthrough in the meeting? Was this a meeting that constituted a breakthrough? Well, I would say [CARDINAL] things. [CARDINAL], there is a -- we have an agreed-upon, appointed process for the continuing of those conversations to happen very quickly. And, again, I will try to get as much information as I can throughout [DATE] and share with you all about the progress and the scheduling for those meetings. I also think that the notion that there was agreement that this is an issue that needed to be dealt with by [DATE], I think those [CARDINAL] things give -- I think they give the President and I hope they give others hope that we can work together. Do you think there is any chance whatsoever that the tax issue will not be resolved by [DATE]? Well, I would hate to say never. I think there is a extremely strong likelihood that the issue is resolved prior to the tax cuts expiring at [DATE]. And I think there is -- I think there was strong agreement to do that. And I think -- I think there was an acknowledgment on the part of all those involved that we have a window of time to work together on this issue. We have got [DATE] to come to a conclusion on that and we ought to be able to do so. So I think the President believes we can get that done. [DATE]? We could be here like New Year's Eve, I take it. Well, I guess we have got [DATE]. I do not know how many -- It sounds like New Year's Eve. I do not anticipate being here on New Year's Eve, but we will see. So, [INTERVIEWED1], is the next step the [ORG] director, the [ORG] secretary and representatives of the different camps getting together and trying to hammer this out? Or what is Yes. And, again, I will -- the way they left it in the meeting, there was an agreement that we would have this group of people do this. The Vice President, I think rightly so, pushed to have a meeting as quickly as possible. And like I said, it could happen [DATE]. Is the [NORP] position on the tax cuts truly unified? I mean, publicly it sounded like maybe the President was ready for compromise, but perhaps some of the leaders on the [ORG] were not as eager to compromise. How so? Well, maybe they were just saying it is got to be the middle class and no higher-income extension. Well, again, look, everybody went in with the position that they brought to that meeting. And I think the President enumerated the position, as he said in the statement, that he and his fellow [NORP] hold, and that is our priority is to ensure that those that are in the middle class in this country that have, as he said during the meeting, have been hurt throughout [DATE] in terms of watching their wages go down even as they were working longer and working harder, that we had to do all that we could to ensure that for that group of people, their taxes did not go up. So I think that -- I think [NORP] are very unified in that. Are you freer [DATE] to talk about the [ORG] cables, or are you choosing not to? No. The law continues to not allow me to speak about classified information, so -- It is worth a shot. It is unclear whether there is a period in which that becomes operable for me, but -- Can I follow up on that? There have been several significant stories on the agenda [DATE]. But over [DATE], obviously, there were great concerns about [GPE]. What is your read of the situation in [GPE] right now? Are we on the brink of war? Have temperatures calmed a bit? Well, I will say I think that there have been a series of meetings throughout [DATE] and [DATE] here at a deputy and a principals' committee level. As you know, the President spoke with President [PERSON] in [GPE]. We dispatched for joint exercises the aircraft carrier [PERSON]. And we remain committed to -- as you heard the President say [DATE] and during our trip to [GPE] -- remain committed to the common security of our allies in [GPE]. And as I said [DATE], [PERSON], I think the [NORP] have a duty and an obligation to greatly press upon [NORP] that their belligerent behavior has to come to an end. And I think you will see progress on multilateral discussions around this over [DATE]. Just a quick follow-up. Does the [GPE] government believe [GPE] has done enough so far? I do not know that I am going to get into grading them, [PERSON], as much as I am going to say that there is an obligation there, and we expect them to live up to that obligation. Should we let the record show that you did not have praise for what they have done so far but said an obligation -- Well, again, I think that the bottom line is movement and progress with [NORP]. Back to the meeting with the congressional leaders, was there an agreement among everybody in the room that there would not be a whole bunch of votes on the floor until this smaller group with [PERSON] and -- Not that I am aware of. I mean, I can go back and check with others and see what their impression was. But, again -- So it is still possible that the [ORG] -- it is still possible that there are other votes on -- I anticipate that the -- I think the next vote on taxes, if I am not mistaken, and I will double-check on this, is that there will be a vote in the [ORG] on making permanent middle-class tax cuts. I anticipate that -- So there was no agreement of taking that off the table while -- I'd anticipate that that -- -- while this group worked itself out a compromise? I think that goes forward. And the other thing, on START, did -- was there any attempt by -- conversation between, for instance, [PERSON] and [PERSON] with the President sort of mediating and saying, okay, if he takes something off the plate, if he takes DREAM Act off the plate, and then START or any of those -- No, that was not a -- that was not something that was discussed. The President spent [TIME] walking through why he believed that this was most important -- why this was so important to our national security in verifying what is going on with the [NORP] nuclear arsenal; obviously the reduction in deployed nuclear weapons that we all know is a danger; and our efforts in the world to continue to press on [GPE] and others like [GPE] for the strongest possible sanctions and how all those efforts work multilaterally. Again, I think the President believes and I think -- the President believes that we can -- we have enough time to get this done, while acknowledging that there is going to be a process to this. That process also has included [CARDINAL] hearings. This has been something that is been discussed for going on [DATE]. But I think the President is optimistic we can get this done. Was there consensus on extending unemployment benefits in the room, or was it more of an urging? Let me -- that is not clear in my notes, but I will double-check with others. I think the President was very clear that -- and this was also clear from both [PERSON] and [PERSON] in speaking in the meeting -- that unemployment benefits are given to those that have lost their jobs. That is money that is, almost dollar for dollar, put back into the economy. And, look, the President brought up the fact that we are seeing the beginning of the expiration of unemployment benefits and that even as we have these discussions about extending tax cuts for those who make $[MONEY], 000, those who make a [CARDINAL], those who make [MONEY] a year, we certainly in no way can afford to look past the fact that there are those that have been hurt extensively in losing a job and need to continue to have those benefits. Was that argument met with any sort of [NORP] agreement on this, or did -- Not that I recall in my notes, to be honest with you. And is this a bright line? I mean, has the President said, look, if he does not get this, we are going to yank this off the table? I do not -- [PERSON], I do not recall any bright lines in it, [PERSON]. I think the President simply laid out, as [PERSON] and [PERSON] did, the importance of ensuring that this be and must -- that this must be part of the solution. We cannot -- again, we are going back and forth here on the permanence of tax cuts for those that make a lot of money. Was there an okay -- were you guys agreeing on any way of paying for it, saying, look, if you guys -- because [NORP] stance has been, find a way to do this, find a way to pay for it. Did you guys offer up, here is a way to pay for it -- No, the President mentioned that this is normally and has historically been considered, rightly so, a measure of extraordinary importance and extraordinary times and should be considered the same now. Thank you. A couple questions. [CARDINAL], the President said in his statement that on the tax cut negotiations he hoped to get some answers back over [DATE]. So does that mean that he is hoping that there is an agreement within [DATE]? Well, I think we can -- look, if you could get an agreement [DATE], that'd be great. I think what the President is saying is we want to continue to see forward progress on this. Again, the agreement to come out of this meeting with those that would sit down, again, as soon as [DATE], I think give the President some hope. And as soon as I have updates on that schedule, we will let you know. I mean, but is he setting up an expectation that he is hoping to have a deal within [DATE]? I think the President is setting up the expectation that we will all get in the same room and continue to make progress on this over [DATE]. And this was quite a long meeting. Can you talk at all about what else came up? Did do not ask, do not tell come up? Did DREAM Act come up? Both of those came up, yes. And was it a matter of people just going around the room and stating their previously stated positions? No, I think that -- again, the meeting started out with the President opening up, and then I think each of the [CARDINAL] members and senators spoke about what they saw as important in the short term and in the medium term. I'd say the tax issue took up by far the majority of time. Again, the President asked both [PERSON] and [PERSON] to give an update on where they thought we were economically. Again, I should note that my timing and my percentages here does not include [TIME] in the private dining room without staff. So those [CARDINAL] issues came up -- did the President bring this up, or did others? The President started on the issue agenda after everybody had had a chance to say something, walking through and talking about taxes. And that is when he offered to have Secretary [PERSON] and [ORG] Director [PERSON] sit down with [NORP] and [NORP]. And besides the offer of the [FAC] gathering, do you know anything else? Can you tell us anything else that was discussed during the [TIME] closed portion? I do not have a readout from that, and I do not know that the President would give that to me to read out. [INTERVIEWED1], did anybody raise the nature of the campaign rhetoric that came up before the election? Do you mean Slurpees? Well, I was not going to mention that by name, but as long as you brought it up. Slurpees were not mentioned. My apologies to [ORG]. No, I mean, look, I think there was an acknowledgment, honestly, [PERSON], by everybody that an election had come and gone, and that after elections there is a time in which both parties are responsible for governing the country. The President mentioned and I think others mentioned that -- the acknowledgment that not soon after [CARDINAL] election passes, you enter the political season again, but that he believed -- the President certainly believes that there is a time in which we can seek common ground, that we can work together and that we can make progress on these issues; that there'll be plenty of time for -- there will be plenty of time for a political campaign in [DATE]. And I would -- I think the President's line in his statement that -- acknowledged and agreed to by those in the room -- that it is time to put our focus on their jobs, the jobs of the [NORP] people, not on the jobs of the elected officials that sit in that room. Any reaction here to the [ORG] vote on earmarks? Let me get some on that. I missed that because I was in the meeting. But let me take that question. I want to shift over to the debt commission. Apparently [PERSON] and Senator [PERSON] were down here just recently here [DATE]. I think they were having lunch with the Vice President, if I am not mistaken. [PERSON] is saying that the debt commission is having trouble getting a vote and that they are going ask for a delay until [DATE]. Can you fill us in on that? Do you know anything? [PERSON], I would -- I do not -- I would point you to the commission and their staff to answer that question. I do not know definitively the answer to that. All right. Another question, Senator [PERSON] has suggested as a possible compromise in the tax cuts of raising it from $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] up to [MONEY]. What does the President think of that? Does that have shades of a compromise? I do not , quite frankly, see that it has -- I do not see that it has moved any [NORP], and I think the President has restated the case [DATE] for a $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] threshold for those filing together. Has the President put any limitations on concessions that [PERSON] and [PERSON] can make in these negotiations, or is he willing to accept anything that they agree on? Well, they are negotiating for him, so I do not -- So how closely will he watch these negotiations, then? I mean, will he keep tabs on the back-and-forth? Yes, I anticipate that the President will on occasion ask his [ORG] Secretary what are the byproducts of said negotiations. Yes, I mean, obviously this is -- I mean, again, the majority of [TIME] that was spent with staff in [FAC] was done on taxes, and as [PERSON] mentioned, that part of the statement where the President hopes to see some progress in [DATE]. I think the President will be eager for -- and all the participants -- were eager for getting together as quickly as possible. I think Senator [PERSON] said to Secretary [PERSON] and to Director [PERSON], you just tell us what time and we will have our people there. So, again, I think this will happen quickly. The meetings, I mean. Right. Why did not the President do a better job in [DATE] of reaching out to [NORP]? When he is been asked that question in the past he is rejected the premise. Well, I think that the President -- without looking too much backward -- I think the President understands that we are in a period of, as I said earlier, we are going to enter into a period of divided government, that in order for a piece of legislation to make its way through the [ORG] and the [ORG] to get to his desk it is going to go through a body that is controlled by [CARDINAL] party and then go to a body controlled by a different party. So if -- that is going to require better communication; that is going to require more communication; it is going to require a better relationship in understanding on both sides what is important. And I think the President is acknowledging that and willing to do his part in changing that. Was there a particular reason he decided to move the meeting from a larger gathering to a smaller one? Was there something particular that happened in the larger session that made him decide that something could be accomplished -- No, I think the President just wanted to give everyone an opportunity to speak as -- I mean, people were speaking pretty freely, but if people wanted to do so without note-takers and such, that they'd feel free to do that. And I think it was productive. Did the President mention to Senator [PERSON] his statement about his first priority being to deny him a second term? Not that I recall. And moving to a different subject, do you -- I mean, I -- as I said to [PERSON], I think there was an acknowledgment that there will be time for a political campaign, but that now is a time for those responsible for governing the country to get about doing so. Did the President discuss his priority for whether Senator [PERSON] is reelected? Not that I recall that, either. On a different subject, President [PERSON] in [GPE] gave his State of the Union equivalent address [DATE] and said that there might be a new arms race if there was not a cooperation agreement on missile defense; expressed some frustration that things had not gone as far as he wanted in [GPE]. What is your reaction to that? Well, I think that -- I mean, look, I think the President mentioned in the meeting with the leaders [TIME] that we had actually made great progress on missile defense. We had -- what was -- what had been a contentious issue [DATE] now is part of an agreement with [ORG] with the cooperation of [GPE], and that that made -- look, we had made -- and I think there is been an acknowledgment that we have made -- both parties have had a priority on protecting our friends and allies in Europe, and obviously [GPE]. And our agreements in [GPE] make concrete [DATE] of effort into a missile defense apparatus that provides greater protection for Europe and for [GPE], and that he was pleased with that progress, and that that was not -- nothing in that, nothing in START constrained our ability to do that. That was clear, even as you had the head of [ORG] pushing and advocating for ratification of START; was also working through getting [ORG] on board for missile defense. I will say, taking this a step back, the President reiterated to those in [FAC] the genuine importance of -- and why it made so much sense for our security and in working with [GPE] and [PERSON], why it made so much sense for us to get this done and get this done now; that this was not something that the President was doing for political purposes or that the opposition was based on politics, but that this just made good sense and made common sense for our security and for our relationships around the world. Do you have any response to the information [ORG] reported about the [NORP] moving tactical weapons, nuclear weapons, closer to [ORG] countries in [DATE]? Let me just get something from [ORG] on that. I mean, obviously that is -- tactical is not something that is -- those are different from launchers and deployed missiles in [ORG]. Yes, sir. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED1]. [GPE] warned [DATE] that the continuing military exercise by the [GPE] and [GPE] in Yellow Sea could lead to all-out war any time. So how effective does the administration believe the military exercise could deter [GPE] -- Well, their -- I guess I would disagree largely with the statement that exercises that are going on now or have -- that are similar to exercises that have gone on in the past are -- will lead us to where they said in that statement. I do not think that is true. I think the exercises demonstrate our strong desire for common security with our allies in [GPE]. And also could you -- sorry, could you give us some detail about the coming meeting between the [GPE], [GPE] and [GPE] [DATE] in [GPE]? Let me get that from [ORG] and [ORG]. Did the President secure from the [NORP] any commitments on the [DATE] pay freeze for rank-and-file government employees? And did he urge them to do the same for their own congressional staff? I do not think the latter came up. I know that -- Why not? I do not know. I do not -- it just was not something that they talked about. I mean, again, legislative branch appropriations govern the salaries of those working -- But the President would like to see it extended, would not he? I have not asked him, [PERSON]. But, again, that is something that members of [ORG] -- based on their appropriations -- have the power to do. Several members mentioned, on both sides, that -- spending and the deficit obviously was something that was talked about quite a bit, and that we are going to have to make a series of decisions that might not be popular in individual districts, particularly around the [GPE] area, but that are hard decisions that ultimately have to be made if we are going to make progress on our deficits and our debt. And the -- several applauded the President for making that decision. I will be honest in saying that some believed that non-uniform military and others they thought should have been covered in what the President announced [DATE]. But I think what -- the President believes that, as you heard [DATE], that we all have a responsibility to do our part. And now that the embargo has been lifted on the military review on do not ask, do not tell, what kind of value does the President put on the kind of poll, the survey done of [NORP] military personnel -- [PERCENT] of them responded. They basically said they saw no problems, foresaw no problems getting rid of the policy. Does the President put a lot of weight in that? Well, I think the President -- the President wanted to and the [ORG] conducted a study of the attitudes of those serving in our armed forces bravely [DATE] and asked directly their attitudes on ending what the President believes is a divisive policy in do not ask, do not tell. And, again, we will have a statement on this shortly, but the President has been clear that this is a policy that should end, needs to end. And I think that the survey demonstrates that those that serve in the military believe it can be done in a way that does not disrupt unit cohesion and that -- The survey did not ask whether it should. It asked do you think the military can -- Right, no, no -- and I think the overwhelming majority said that they thought it would -- could be done with little to no disruption. And I think the President certainly shares that. Again, I think you will hear from Secretary [PERSON] -- well, you are hearing from Secretary [PERSON] and Admiral [PERSON] -- and the President's strong belief that doing this through a legislative process provides for a transition that -- an orderly transition that the military has sought and that the President believes is the right way to go about doing it. [INTERVIEWED1], I am curious about that private part of the meeting [DATE]. Does he -- has he done that before, where he sends all the staff out of the room? That is not unusual? No, it is not unusual. Was that -- I mean, look, I do not -- I will say this. It is not unusual writ large in meetings. I do not know that it -- I'd have to go back and check notes and see whether that is happened before in -- I do not recall that it is happened before in the bipartisan meetings. The ones that were had in [FAC], as best I can remember, were always what was set forth in the room and not -- and they did not generally repair to somewhere else. You made note [TIME] that note-takers were out of the room for that. Was that private part of the meeting specifically to interrupt the spin cycle that the President talked about happening? Well, I think it just -- I think it provides people with a candid -- they can be even more candid than they could be in a room full of people. And that is why the President would -- sought to do it. And, again, I think the President believed that both parts of the meeting were productive. And someone in that meeting -- in that part of the meeting, brought up the spin cycle. He said it was one of my friends or my friends. Do you know who brought that up and what was said about it? No, I was -- no, I do not . I do not know the answer to that. Yes, ma'am. President [PERSON] acknowledged that he needed to improve his communication. Is some of that going to include some more informal talks, or off-the-agenda discussions between him and [NORP] leaders like Secretary -- Senator [PERSON] and [PERSON]? Yes, I think that -- look, they have had -- he is had occasion to talk with Senator [PERSON] and Speaker-to-be [PERSON] during some of this time period. I anticipate that those are conversations that you will see more of. I do not think that -- well, I know that what the President discussed and what the President means in terms of improving that outreach and that communication is not simply reserved for meetings that happen here or meetings that happen at [FAC]. I think you will see just an increase in all types of that communication. And [CARDINAL] more quick one about START. The President talks a lot about what might happen in [DATE] if this process is pushed back in terms of re-educating new members about the treaty and what is in it. Did he bring that up in the meeting with [NORP] leaders? And did they have any response or acknowledgment of his -- No, I do not remember that coming up. Obviously they are -- again, it is been -- I think there is a pretty long record of hearings, formal written questions back and forth out of those hearings on where -- on different aspects of the treaty, and I know that members of our national security team continue to brief members on it, and I think anybody that has questions can get those answered. [INTERVIEWED1], on a historic story -- stick with what you have right now -- on that side of [FAC], the [ORG] is getting ready to pass [PERSON], [ORG] and the water rights issue. What does [ORG] have to say about this, after [DATE] it is finally going to happen? Well, I think based on hard work both on [ORG] and in the administration that we are about to or on the cusp of seeing a much deserved settlement for these [CARDINAL] important cases. It is, as you mentioned, [DATE], justice that is overdue and has been a priority, again, of the administration and those on [ORG] to see something done by [DATE]. I think it demonstrates that it is possible to work together. I think it demonstrates that we can find common ground on issues that are important to both sides of the political aisle. And I think it gives people hope for what we can do. But a couple questions on the [ORG] issue. It is been raised the anti-fraud issue, the anti-fraud language that is in the bill. Some [NORP] on the [ORG] feel that it could be a tool for intimidation against the farmers. What say you? I would have to ask -- I guess I would point you to [ORG] on what their reaction is to that. And [CARDINAL] more. Why is there a difference in the stringency for judgments when it comes to women and [PERSON] versus the [ORG] climate -- the [ORG] people had to go -- go through a much more arduous process to get -- [DATE], I do not -- again, I'd point you to [ORG] on the specifics of that settlement. Will there be a signing ceremony, since this is one of the largest civil rights payouts -- Let us get it to the President's desk and then we will go from there. Thanks. I want to follow up on a question from [DATE]'s briefing that you might have read out, but I do not think I got a readout on it. It was about the meeting between the President and the service chiefs [DATE]. And the question was, what did they talk about? And did the President specifically ask them to stop opposing the repeal of do not ask, do not tell or to get onboard? Let me -- the President asked -- I was not in the meeting, as I said [DATE], because of being out here. The President wanted to have a private conversation with the Joint Chiefs and asked that that conversation be private, and I am not going to violate the President's wishes on that. Obviously the -- I am told that the -- do not ask, do not tell, obviously, was the entire topic of the meeting. Okay, but so the reason we have not heard more is because we are not going to hear more? I tried, and the President was clear that this would be a private meeting. Yes, ma'am. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED1]. What is the [ORG] view at this moment on what is happening in [GPE] with the presidential election and the cholera epidemic? Let me get some guidance from these guys on [GPE]. Yes, sir. Since Secretary [PERSON]'s strong message [DATE] regarding the [ORG], has the President felt compelled to call any of his -- any of the leaders -- for example, Prime Minister [PERSON] or anyone else? The President, to my knowledge, has not made -- not made any calls on this. Again, I think this continues to be handled at [ORG] at the foreign minister level. And I would say -- I would reiterate largely what we said [DATE]. Our foreign policy is far stronger than [CARDINAL] website. To follow up on [PERSON]'s question about timing, Senator [PERSON] said in his news conference that the [ORG] might be able to take up START if they could quickly clear the decks of tax cuts and stop-gap spending, or an extension of omnibus spending bill. So is part of the understanding in the room, behind the President's comments about wanting answers quickly, is that you'd get a quick deal on tax cuts in order to leave time for a START debate in the [ORG]? I think the President understands the desire to have a discussion on START and believes that that can be accomplished. But I think the President was clear with the leaders that he has -- he is faced with [CARDINAL] roles: ensuring our economic strength in creating jobs and protecting the [NORP] people. He does not have the luxury of deciding only to do [CARDINAL] of those things. And I do not believe that the President thinks that the [ORG] can only do [CARDINAL] of those things, either. And I think we can make progress. Thank you. A follow-up to [PERSON]'s question about the missile defense. The [NORP], when they discuss the issue, they keep sounding as if they -- they keep saying they want real partnership and they keep sounding as if they do not believe the [GPE] is ready for a real partnership. After [GPE], do you have a feeling that both sides understand what each one means by real partnership ? And is the [GPE] ready for such a partnership on missile defense? I think that [GPE] demonstrates that an issue that had been contentious can be cooperative. Again, I think it is clear that the administration through its phased adaptive plan set forth a missile defense apparatus and program that we believe more greatly protects our security. And we pursued and got [ORG] to sign off on the pursuit of that. I think writ large in our relationship with [GPE] we have made -- and the President mentioned this [DATE] -- we have made tremendous progress. We are working together on issues that [DATE] separated us. I think [GPE] sanctions is a good example. I think that only because of the strong and real partnership we have were we able to see the type of sanctions that are having a real bite and a real impact in [GPE]. And that relationship is important to this country and to this President. And [CARDINAL] thing on the same subject. President [PERSON] actually referred to a strike capability. He said that if this partnership does not materialize, then within that [DATE] period that he described [GPE] will have to take a hard decision on the strike capability, that it will have to deploy. Was it the way that the [NORP] framed this issue in [GPE], and do you have any idea what strike capabilities they are talking about? I would point you to your comrades in [GPE]. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED1]. [CARDINAL] quick question. On the way in I saw President [PERSON] headed into [FAC]. Was he going to meet with President [PERSON]? I believe his schedule had a meeting with our National Security Advisor and I believe the President also asked President [PERSON] to stop in. Regarding [GPE]? That is all I know, and I will try to find more. And will he be available for reporters? That is not my bailiwick. Tell him to go the stakeout. But I will say that you guys both wanted to see him, how about that? I will try to get some more information. Thanks, guys.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretarysarahsanders54", "text": "We are also continuing to monitor the situations, both in [GPE], [GPE] and in [GPE]. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims involved in these situations, and we will continue to work with state and local law enforcement officials around both of those incidents. And with that, I will take your questions. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED], let me start by asking you what the President said about potentially meeting with [PERSON] soon. There is nothing that will put them in the same city at the same time until [DATE], at the earliest. So what he is talked about, in terms of soon, would that include either a visit of [PERSON] to [FAC] or the President going to [GPE]? There are no specific plans made at this time. But we want to continue to have a dialogue with [GPE], and continue to talk about some of the shared interests we have, whether it is [GPE], [GPE], and, particularly as the President noted [DATE], slowing the tensions when it comes to an arms race, something that is clearly important to both leaders. And now that [PERSON] has won yet another term as President, is President [PERSON] concerned that he will continue his aggressive posture toward the rest of the world, and maybe even increase that posture? Look, we are going to continue to maintain the position that we have had, and be tough when necessary. At the same time, we want to continue to have dialogue so that we can work on some of the issues that concern both countries. And we are going to continue to do that, while also continuing to be tough on a number of things, including sanctions on [GPE], rebuilding our own military, and exporting energy -- things that we know are not great for [GPE]. Let me get your reaction to a statement that Senator [PERSON], the Chairman of [ORG], just put out. And I am quoting him directly here: An [NORP] president does not lead [ORG] by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections. And by doing so with [PERSON], President [PERSON] insulted every [NORP] citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election to determine their country's future, including the countless [NORP] patriots who have risked so much to protest and resist [PERSON]'s regime. How do you respond? Look, the President, once again, has maintained that it is important for us to have a dialogue with [GPE] so that we can focus on some areas of shared interests -- the ones that I have already named. At the same time, we are going to continue to be tough on them. The President joined other countries in these calls. Both [GPE] and [GPE] have reached out, as well as President [PERSON] in [DATE]. These are conversations that sometimes take place. And, certainly, the President finds there to be an importance in having that dialogue with [GPE] so that we can talk about some of the big problems that face the world. Does [ORG] disagree with Senator [PERSON]'s characterization of this as a sham election ? We disagree with the fact that we should not have conversations with [GPE]. There are important topics that we should be able to discuss. And that is why the President is going to continue to have that dialogue. At the same time, we have been very clear in the actions that we have taken that we are going to be tough on [GPE], particularly when it comes to areas that we feel where they have stepped out of place. We have placed tough sanctions on [GPE] and a number of other things where we have shown exactly what our position is. But since you brought it up in context of [PERSON]'s question about timing -- since you mentioned [GPE] and [GPE], is it the President's intention to meet with [PERSON] before he sees [PERSON] or makes a decision on the [GPE] nuclear deal? Again, we do not have any specific plans laid out at this time. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED]. Neither the [ORG] readout of that phone call with [PERSON] nor the [ORG]'s readout says anything about election meddling. Did the President not raise the issue of [NORP] election meddling in that phone call? I do not believe it came on this specific call, but it is something that we have spoken extensively about and continue to look at ways and steps forward to make sure it never happens again. And on the President's new attorney, [PERSON], he says that there is this brazen plot by the [ORG] and the [ORG] to frame the President. Does [ORG] share that view? Is there a plot to frame President [PERSON]? Look, we certainly have said that there have been some concerns with some of the actions that were taken. But in terms of any comments that he is made, I could not speak to those. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED]. [CARDINAL] more questions on the [PERSON] phone call. First, does [ORG] believe the election in [GPE] was free and fair? I am sorry? Does [ORG] believe that the election in [GPE] was free and fair? Look, in terms of the election there, we are focused on our elections. We do not get to dictate how other countries operate. What we do know is that [PERSON] has been elected in their country, and that is not something that we can dictate to them how they operate. We can only focus on the freeness and the fairness of our elections, something we 100 percent fully support and something we are going to continue to do everything we can to protect to make sure bad actors do not have the opportunity to impact them in any way. And you said election meddling did not come up in the call. I am curious -- did the recent poisoning in [GPE] come up in the call? I do not believe that was discussed in [DATE]'s call. Thanks a lot, [INTERVIEWED]. Over [DATE], on [CARDINAL] of the [DATE] [TIME] shows, [PERSON], [NORP] of [GPE], said when responding to the various tweets that the President had put out over [DATE] regarding Special Counsel [PERSON], he said, When you are innocent, act like it. What is your response to what [PERSON] said over [DATE]? Look, the President has been very clear about the fact that there was no collusion between his campaign and any other entity. However, to pretend like going through this absurd process for [DATE] would not bring frustration seems a little bit ridiculous. I do not think that any individual, including members of [ORG], would like it if they had been accused of taking their seat in [ORG] by doing something nefarious when they had not , particularly if it went on for [DATE] into their time in office. My guess is they would be more than anxious to push back, and certainly would defend themselves as the President has clearly done in this situation and has since [DATE]. Another [NORP] over [DATE], [PERSON], also a [NORP] from [GPE], said that, If the President were to fire -- Maybe we need to work on our [GPE] members. Yeah. He said that, If the President tries to fire [PERSON], it would be the beginning of the end of his presidency. What is your response to what [PERSON] said? As [ORG] Counsel, [PERSON] said [DATE], [ORG] yet again confirms that the President is not considering or discussing the firing of the Special Counsel [PERSON]. Do you feel like you are losing [NORP] in -- Sorry? Do you feel like you are losing [NORP] in some way? That these [CARDINAL] prominent [NORP] from [GPE] both spoke in this manner over [DATE]? I certainly do not think we are losing [NORP] at all. I think we are voicing some frustration over this ongoing process that we look forward to ending soon. In [DATE], the President told a room full of reporters that he would love to sit down and do an interview with [PERSON] under oath and in [DATE]. At the time, that is what he said. Obviously, that timeframe has passed. Does he still want to sit down and do an interview with [PERSON]? Look, we have been fully transparent throughout this process. We have been fully cooperative, and we are going to continue to be cooperative with [ORG]. Beyond that, I cannot go any further. Can you just provide more clarity on the President's tweets toward [PERSON] over [DATE] over [DATE], calling him out by name? What was behind that? Like I just said, clearly we have not been shy about the fact that there is frustration of this process. We would like it to end quickly and soon. And the President has contended since [DATE], and will continue to do so, that there was absolutely no collusion between his campaign and any outside force or country. And so I do not understand why it is hard for anyone to process. If you had been attacked mercilessly and continuously, day in, day out, every single second while you are trying to work hard to do good things for this country, and, literally, [DATE] you wake up to an onslaught of people saying that you are there because of reasons that are completely false, that is frustrating. And, certainly, I think fair for him to be frustrated. So why does not he push for the firing? Why does not he push for the firing of [PERSON] if he thinks the probe should not have begun in the first place, if he thinks the whole thing is a witch hunt? Why does not he push for the firing? Look, we are going to continue to be cooperative, and we would like this to wrap up soon. We do not feel like that is the most productive step forward. But we would like to see this come to a conclusion. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED]. I want to follow up on the accusations of fraud in the [NORP] election. Why does the [GPE] government not believe that it should criticize [GPE] for these accusations, which have been brought up by the [ORG] and [GPE] government directly in a statement? You know, they are listing things like restrictions on fundamental freedoms and lack of access for opposition candidates. I mean, why does not the President or [ORG] believe that is something that they should be discussing with the [NORP] leader? I did not say that we could not discuss it with the [NORP] leader. I said it did not come up on [DATE]'s call. Again, the focus was to talk about areas of shared interest. We know that we need to continue a dialogue. It is important for a lot of the safety and security of people across the globe. We would like to be able to work with them on things like [GPE], on [GPE], and also, both countries' shared interest in lowering the tensions when it comes to an arms race, recognizing that that is not the best thing for either country. And so we want to be able to have those conversations. And that was the point of [DATE]'s call. So when is an appropriate time to raise questions about, you know, political freedoms with [GPE]? Look, we have continued to talk about these important issues, but that is not simply what [DATE]'s call was about. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED]. [CARDINAL] questions. First, we have discussed the President's call to President [PERSON] following his reelection. Did the President make a similar call to Chancellor [PERSON], who has just formed a new government and assumed her fourth mandate in [GPE]? I know he spoke with the Chancellor, I believe, it was [DATE]. I'd have to look back at the specific details of their conversation, but I know that they spoke within [DATE]. The other thing is that Congressman [PERSON] of [GPE] is expected, if not [DATE], sometime in [DATE], to announce he is not running for reelection, making him the 38th [NORP] [ORG] member to announce retirement, resignation, or pursuit of another office -- a post-World War II high in the exodus of [NORP] [ORG] members. Is this something the President is bothered about? And do members call him when they say they will make announcements like this? Certainly, he is had conversations with a number of members. I cannot speak to this situation specifically and whether or not he is spoken with the President. We are not concerned. Right now, we think we have got a great story to tell after [DATE] of being in office, and we look forward to communicating that to the [NORP] people and continuing to push the President's agenda. [INTERVIEWED], did the topic of religious liberty come up at all with the Crown Prince [DATE]? Did the President bring that up at all? I do not believe that came up, but I'd have to check on the last [CARDINAL] of the meeting to be sure, because I was not there. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED]. [CARDINAL] foreign policy questions for you. [ORG] estimates that the [NORP]-led coalition is responsible in [DATE] for the deaths of [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] civilians, and took part in [CARDINAL] unlawful airstrikes. Did the President bring up these concerns about high civilian casualties in his meeting with the Crown Prince [DATE]? I am not aware that that came up specifically. Again, I'd have to check on the last [CARDINAL] of the meeting because I am not sure, because I was on my way out here. And if I ask you about the call between President [PERSON] and [NORP] President [PERSON]. The [NORP] said that [GPE] came up in the call. The readout that was released by the [PERSON] administration did not include any mention of [GPE]. Did the President discuss the issue of [GPE] with [PERSON]? And did he discuss the high civilian casualties as a result of efforts by the [PERSON] regime and the [NORP] government on the ground in [GPE]? It briefly came up. And as you know, we have had a number of public statements on our position there, and that certainly has not changed. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED]. [DATE], the [NORP] Prime Minister noticed the signs of the pace of NAFTA talks is accelerating. And he said that the President -- President [PERSON] -- is enthusiastic about getting a deal. Is the President that enthusiastic? The President is always enthusiastic about making a good deal, but that would be -- the key caveat to any conversation is making sure that whatever deal he makes is good for [NORP] and [NORP] workers. And so anything we do, that would have to be a part of that conversation. There seems to be a [DATE] deadline. After that, the entire political process is going to get over the negotiations on NAFTA. Anything possible be that quick within [DATE]? I do not have any specific announcement as of this time, but we are continuing to have those negotiations and continuing to have those conversations being led primarily by Ambassador [PERSON] and working with the President. I will take [CARDINAL] last questions before the President's event. [PERSON]. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED]. The President frequently speaks about the need to improve the nation's crumbling infrastructure. Can you explain his opposition to [ORG], which is to put a rail tunnel between [GPE] and his home state of [GPE], but has the support of many [NORP], and also, according to [CARDINAL] study, is key to [PERCENT] of the nation's gross national product? The President specifically wants to address infrastructure on a broader scale, not put all our emphasis into [CARDINAL] project. We certainly want to see the infrastructure across this country rebuilt, which is why we put forward priorities when it comes to that in a plan moving forward. And we look forward to working with [ORG] to make some real progress on that in [DATE]. Thanks so much. And the President has got an event here in [TIME]. Thanks, guys.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretaryjoshearnest238", "text": "Good [TIME], everybody. It is nice to see you all. You just got the readout of the President's meeting with the [PERSON] of [GPE]. They had an opportunity to speak for themselves to readout that meeting. Other than noting that, I do not have anything at the top here so we can go straight to questions. [PERSON], do you want to get us started? Sure. Thank you. First of all, the Keystone bill is arriving at [ORG] [DATE], or already has. That is what I hear. Can you tell us when the President intends to veto it, as he promised? Well, as I mentioned [DATE], the President does intend to veto this piece of legislation and we intend to do it without any drama or fanfare or delay. So I would anticipate that we will have an update on this [TIME] [DATE]. So you expect it [DATE]? We can expect it [DATE]? Yes, you can count on that [DATE]. Coverage or paper statement? We will have a statement through the usual channels. No photo spray or anything? No. It is in the pipeline. Would not want that news to leak out some other way. You physically have the bill now? It is my understanding that [ORG] did send the text of the bill to [ORG] [TIME]. On [ORG] funding, as you know, the [ORG] Majority Leader has offered to split the bill so that there is a separate vote on the immigration policies of the President and another one on the funding itself. Senator [PERSON] has objected to the sequencing of that. He wants to vote on the clean funding bill first before you go on to immigration. Does the President have a preference on that? Does the President want to at least just get this issue off the table and it does not matter on sequencing? What is [ORG] position? The official [ORG] position is that the President served in [ORG] [ORG] for a period [DATE], in which he readily weighed in on legislative maneuvers and strategies related to the complicated procedures that essentially guide the legislative process. At this point, it is the responsibility of [ORG] to figure out how to perform among their most basic functions, which is to ensure that the budget for [ORG] gets passed in a timely fashion. But, [INTERVIEWED1], this is his party and it could essentially end up closing [CARDINAL] of his executive agencies. The President has -- well, [NORP] spent a lot of time and a lot of money and a lot of effort going around the country about making the case why they should be put in charge of the [GPE] [ORG]. They succeeded in that effort, and they persuaded the [NORP] people to hand them the responsibility of the majority of both [ORG] and [ORG]. And the question now facing [NORP] is how they are going to use that authority and whether or not they are going to do it responsibly, in a way that is in the best interest of the country and whether or not it is in the best interest of our national security. And the fact of the matter is I cannot find anybody who thinks it is a good idea to shut down [ORG], which means that congressional [NORP] should simply do their job. And they should pass legislation that would fully fund [ORG] for the remainder of [DATE]. And Senator [PERSON] is offering a clean bill like you demanded, so why not get behind this bill? Well, I have not seen the particulars in terms of exactly what he is put forward, but ultimately it will be up to the individual members of [ORG] to make their own decision. But, again, congressional [NORP] are in charge. They are in the majority. And this is something that they sought, and these are exactly the kinds of problems that they hoped to have the opportunity to solve, and we look forward to them doing it. Next question on [GPE]. The contours of the deal that are being discussed would allow [GPE] to potentially consider moving toward a nuclear device after [DATE]. And I am wondering if that is a period of time -- I know that parts of the discussion have been about a [DATE] period before -- that seems to be the compromise number. Is that a number that we can trust the [NORP] to stick by and not to begin producing a nuclear device after that? Well, [PERSON], I am loathe to get into the negotiating details of the position that is adopted by [GPE] and our international partners when they are sitting across the table from the [NORP]. However, I will say that there was a report [DATE] indicating that we were negotiating for essentially a [DATE] deal. Those reports are not correct. That does not reflect the accurate negotiating position of [GPE] and our international partners. But the second part of your question is important as well. It goes to whether or not [GPE] and the international community is prepared to start trusting the [NORP]. I think the point, [PERSON], of these negotiations is to not just reach an agreement with the [NORP], but reach an agreement with the [NORP] that we can verify on a continuing, ongoing basis; that there is ample reason for the international community to not put a lot of faith in the claims of the [NORP] when it comes to their nuclear program. It was [DATE] that there was this covert nuclear facility in [GPE] that had previously been undeclared that did yield some evidence indicating that [GPE] was trying to secretly develop a nuclear weapon. So what we need is a clear agreement from the international community and the [NORP] and an agreement that is verifiable. And any part of an agreement will include ready access by the international community to ensure that [GPE] is living up to their end of the bargain. But you are saying that reports that the deal would clamp down on [GPE]'s nuclear activities for [DATE] and then slowly ease those restrictions, that is not correct? Well, again, I am not willing to get into the specific details of our negotiating position. But there are some who are making the case publicly that we are in favor of a deal that would just be [DATE] in duration, and that is not accurate. [PERSON]. On [ORG], the veto is one thing, but I am wondering, how long is it going to take the administration to finish its review of whether the project is in the national interest? Is that something that is going to happen [DATE] as well? This is a review that is being conducted by [ORG], and so you can contact [ORG] for an update on the timing of that review. The President is not going to announce something on that as well [DATE]? Again, the review is being conducted by [ORG], so you can get an update from them about their timing. Secondly, there are reports that the [ORG] is not going to press charges against [PERSON] for the shooting of [PERSON]. Can you confirm that? I cannot confirm that. So you should check with [ORG] about any announcement they may or may not be planning to make at this point. Okay. Lastly, on [GPE], Prime Minister [PERSON] said he would deploy military personnel in [DATE] to [GPE] to help with training, and I am wondering if that is something that the [GPE] is considering -- any measures to help [GPE] with military training? Well, let me say a couple things about this. The first is that [GPE] continues to be concerned by ongoing violations of the Minsk Implementation Plan by [NORP]-backed separatists in [GPE]. We have seen repeatedly that these [NORP]-backed separatists have continued to violate the terms of the agreement despite the fact that they made firm commitments in the context of an immediate and comprehensive cease-fire. In addition to that, we have seen [NORP] military vehicles -- I am sorry -- we have seen [NORP] military personnel have participated in the recent attacks on [GPE] and [GPE]. And the [NORP] military has put in place a robust command structure in eastern [GPE]. We know this because separatist fighters have also previously acknowledged that they are operating under instructions from [GPE]. [GPE] and the separatists it backs have acted in direct contravention of the Minsk Implementation Plan that they agreed to. And we continue to call on all signatories to carry out the commitments undertaken in the plan in the September Minsk Agreements fully and without delay. The other thing that we are concerned about is that there are reports that [NORP]-backed separatists have prevented members of the [ORG] special monitoring mission from getting full access to the conflict areas. There are even some reports that indicate that those separatists have made grave threats against members of the [ORG] monitoring team. So we have seen continued behavior that is in direct violation of the agreement that [GPE] and the other parties signed [DATE]. So we continue to be concerned about the situation in [GPE]. I do not have any updates in terms of assistance that we will provide to the [NORP] at this point other than to remind you that we have already provided substantial assistance to the [NORP] military and we have already provided substantial economic assistance to the [NORP] government and the [NORP] people. And there was additional assistance the administration believes we should provide and that is why we have called on [ORG] to pass legislation that would offer additional loan guarantees to the [NORP] to strengthen their economy while they try to deal with this continuing instability in the eastern part of the nation. Thanks. Back on [ORG], if I may. Senator [PERSON] is apparently shopping a compromise on the [ORG] right now to try to move forward on that. Is [ORG] looking to find a compromise, or are you still certain you have got to have a clean bill? Well, [INTERVIEWER1], the administration has been clear that we stand ready to compromise with members of [ORG], including [NORP], when it comes to trying to address the many problems caused by our broken immigration system. In fact, we spent a lot of time over [DATE] trying to reach that compromise, and in [ORG] [ORG], we succeeded in doing so, that we got [CARDINAL] [NORP] senators to sign on to a compromise bipartisan immigration reform proposal. That was a proposal that was blocked by [ORG] [NORP], even though we knew that had the [ORG] [NORP] leadership allowed it to come to the floor, it would have passed with bipartisan support. So we do stand ready to have those kinds of conversations with members of [ORG]. But we should not compromise our homeland security just because [NORP] want to pick a political fight. That certainly is not responsible. It is not consistent with the [ORG] Majority Leader's aspirations to send a signal to the [NORP] people that [NORP] leadership should not be scary -- that is his word, not mine. So we are hopeful that [NORP] will do the responsible thing, that they will join with [NORP] to support a [DATE] extension of funding for [ORG] prior to the deadline. And then if there are [NORP] that want to have a legitimate conversation with the administration about how to solve the problems that are created by our broken immigration system, then we stand ready to do that. We'd even host those meetings right here at [ORG] if they would like. Thanks. As far as the meeting [DATE] with the leader of [GPE], there are reports that [GPE] has lent support to [ORG] in the past. Do you think there is an issue with the President meeting with the leader of [GPE] while not meeting with the leader of [GPE]? Well, [INTERVIEWER1], I can tell you that -- let me say a couple things about that. As it relates to Prime Minister [PERSON], as we have said this many times, there is no foreign leader with whom the President has spent more time than Prime Minister [PERSON]. And that is a testament to the deep and ongoing security relationship that exists between [GPE] and [GPE]. Prime Minister [PERSON] himself has said that the level of security coordination between [GPE] and [GPE] under the leadership of President [PERSON] is unprecedented, and we certainly would share that assessment. As it relates to the leader of [GPE], I can tell you that there are a number of important interests that we share with [GPE]. Like all partnerships, especially in this region of the world, [GPE] does not necessarily agree with the [NORP] government on every issue, but we have the kind of relationship that allows us to be frank and open about where we disagree and why. But the bottom line is that our interests with [GPE] converge somewhat more often than they actually diverge; that [GPE] has been a significant help on a range of regional issues, including [GPE], [GPE]. As you know, the [NORP] have even agreed to host a regional training site for the moderate [NORP] opposition. So we certainly welcome the efforts of the [NORP] to participate in this broad international coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy [ORG]. We also know that the [NORP] have indicated a willingness to work closely with us in other aspects of our strategy against [ORG], too, particularly as it relates to terror financing. And this is a focal point of the administration's efforts to shut down terrorism across the globe, but it certainly is an important part of our strategy for degrading and ultimately destroying [ORG] -- that if we can shut off the financing of their operations, we are going to add even further strain to their ability to carry out the terrible things that we have seen them do. So we are working closely with the [NORP] on that aspect of our strategy, too. And I think that is precisely why the President convened the meeting with him in [FAC] [DATE]. On the same subject, do you acknowledge that [GPE] has been a significant source of especially private donations to [ORG] and other terrorist groups? Well, [INTERVIEWER1], what we acknowledge is that there are areas where we disagree with the [NORP], but more often we find that our interests overlap, that our interests with the [NORP] are consistent. And whether it is our work with the international community to try to ease the international community's concerns about [GPE]'s nuclear program, to dealing with the situation in [GPE], or even the ongoing campaign against [ORG], that there are a variety of ways in which [GPE] has been able to work effectively with the [NORP] to protect and advance our national security interests in the region and around the globe. And for a long time, the [NORP] have been accused of trying to play it both ways -- of welcoming hate preachers, as we might call them, to their biggest mosque, of continuing the financing, and only really trying to stop it when pressure is put on. So can you say whether pressure is on them now to stop that financing and whether there has been any progress either in that area or with supporting these people that come in and preach against [NORP] and other faiths? Well, [INTERVIEWER1], I can tell you that the administration does continue to work closely with the [NORP] to try to improve our efforts to shut down the financing for terror operations. And the [NORP] have been an effective partner in that endeavor so far, but we do believe that there is more that they can do and more that we can do together to shut down the financing of terror operations around the globe. And was that made clear [DATE] to them, that they can do more? Well, I do not have a detailed readout of the meeting. It just ended. But you can check with my [ORG] colleagues to see if you can get a better sense of how this issue was discussed in the meeting. And shortly after the video came out of the burning of the [NORP] pilot, it was said that this could be a way to bring in more of the [NORP] participation. Do you anticipate that happening? Because really it is only been [PERCENT] of the airstrikes have come from [NORP] partners and other countries. Do you see that growing? It just seems like it has not changed for the duration of this. Well, [INTERVIEWER1], I think there are a lot of different ways to evaluate this, and certainly the easiest way to evaluate this is to take a close look at the way in which [NORP] countries have participated in our military operations against [ORG]. And as we pointed out on a number of occasions, there are important [NORP] partners who are taking action alongside [NORP] military pilots to strike [ORG] targets in [GPE]. And we certainly welcome that contribution and it is making a tangible contribution to our ongoing effort and to our broader strategy. There also was an important role for them, for our partners in the region, to play when it comes to shutting down [ORG] financing; that there is a lot of money that is moving through that region -- whether it is the black market for oil to other sources of illicit financing for their operations. We are also working with the [NORP] and other regional partners to combat [ORG]'s efforts to move foreign fighters into that region. You will recall that the President convened a meeting of [ORG] to discuss this important issue [DATE]. We continue to work with our partners around the globe and in the region on those efforts. And we also work with [NORP] leaders in the region to try to counter the extremist ideology that [ORG] propagated on social media; that there is an important role for more moderate voices in the [NORP] world to stand up and to use their influence to try to counter that messaging. And we certainly welcome the influence of political leaders in that effort as well. And really quickly, on [PERSON] misstating his past service -- does that bother the President or the administration? Well, [INTERVIEWER1], I can tell you that, obviously, as you know, Secretary [PERSON] went to [FAC]. He served in [ORG]. He is somebody who, when he was in the military, completed jungle, arctic, and desert warfare training. So he is somebody who understands firsthand the sacrifice that our men and women in uniform make on a regular basis. He is also somebody who understands firsthand about why what he said about his service was wrong, and that certainly is why it was appropriate for him to apologize. But there is no reason to think that the mistake that he made should interfere with his ability to continue to lead the fight for our veterans and to continue to implement the kinds of reforms at the [ORG] that are so critical to making sure that our veterans are getting the benefits that they deserve. A couple of quick follow-ups. First, [DATE] I asked you about whether or not the President would be calling congressional leaders to [ORG] to try to work out some agreement to prevent the [ORG] shutdown from happening. Is that going to happen? I do not know of any meeting like that that is planned at this point. But like I said, I believe that members of [ORG] are still returning from their [DATE] recess [DATE] and once they are all back in town, if it is necessary for the President to bring some of them down to [FAC] and have a conversation about this, then we will do that. Do you think it would be productive given what you just said about how the President has been out of the [ORG] for a number of years, does not want to get engaged in these questions of procedural -- I think the point is that it is their responsibility to work this through. And again, [NORP] spent a lot of time trying to persuade the [NORP] people that they should be entrusted with the reins of [ORG] [ORG] and be entrusted with the power of the purse. And we need to see if they are going to step up and assume responsibility. Again, there are probably going to be some times over the course of [DATE] where [NORP] in [ORG] are going to have to make some really tough decisions and take some really difficult votes. I am not really sure why funding [ORG] and making sure that that funding does not lapse is considered a difficult task. But again, this is a challenge for [NORP] leaders to decide if they can demonstrate to the [NORP] public that they are going to continue to act in the country's best interests. On the [GPE] nuclear talks, you said that [ORG] is not negotiating for a [DATE] sunset, basically, [DATE] -- a point where [GPE] would be able to become effectively a nuclear power. Is the administration, is [ORG], the President opposed to a timeline that is so short? You said you are not pushing for it, you are not arguing for it, you are not negotiating for it. But is that a non-starter? Is that something you would not agree to? Well, again, [INTERVIEWER1], I have used this analogy on other occasions, or on other topics. It is not something that you and I can negotiate from here, that ultimately we are going to have a conversation with the [NORP] about the way that they can resolve the international community's concerns with their nuclear program. At this point, there is not more detail that I can share about the negotiating position of [GPE] other than to say that those reports from [TIME] were not accurate and did not accurately reflect our negotiating. I understand why you would not want to negotiate it here, obviously, but this seems to be a pretty fundamental question. The report that you now said was inaccurate, but I am trying to get how much of -- I do not want to use the word red line, but how much of an absolute non-starter that is. The report suggested a deal taking place with the [NORP] after a period of [DATE], where it would basically have no restrictions on their ability to enrich uranium. And I am just asking if that is -- I know that is not the position you are trying to get, but is that simply unacceptable? Well, what is unacceptable is the idea that [GPE] would obtain a nuclear weapon. And that has been our policy for quite some time. And the whole purpose of these negotiations is to make sure that [GPE] does not obtain a nuclear weapon. And the reason for that is that it would be terribly destabilizing for the region. It could precipitate, and I think we could even say is likely to precipitate a nuclear arms race in what is already a very volatile region of the world. That would not be in the best interests of [NORP] national security, and it certainly would not be in the best interest of our closest ally in the region, [GPE]. So that is why we are engaged in these negotiations. And once we have -- the President has indicated that the time for conducting these kinds of negotiations is running short, and so once we have sort of reached the other end of these things, we can have a more detailed conversation about what that deal is. And can you confirm --there was some confusion about the deadline. Is the deadline for these talks [DATE], as [ORG] officials have suggested in the past, or is it [DATE]? You mean [DATE] or [DATE]? I know that it is -- I have always heard people say it is [DATE]. So let me see if I can get back to you with a specific -- if there is a date certain. And just [CARDINAL] quick thing. The [NORP] leaders have said that the President vetoing Keystone would be a political move to please environmental extremists. What is your response to that? Well, the reason the President will veto this legislation that has passed the [ORG] is that it circumvents a longstanding administrative process for evaluating whether or not infrastructure projects like this are in the best interest of the country. And it does not represent a specific position on the pipeline itself. It just merely says that the benefits, the consequences of building that pipeline should be thoroughly evaluated by experts and through this administrative process that has existed for [DATE] and has been used by previous Presidents of both parties to evaluate similar infrastructure projects. And that is the proper path moving forward, but does not represent a final disposition of the [FAC] project. I know the Vice President and the Secretary of [ORG] will be out of town [DATE] during the start of -- actually during the whole [ORG] conference. Will an administration official be addressing the [ORG] conference at all? We will have more information on that soon. Obviously we have received an invitation from [ORG] and we will get back to them. So we should expect just a name -- it is not whether you are going to have an administration official attend the conference. It is just a matter of figuring out which administration official actually addresses [ORG]? Well, again, I think -- we have received the invitation from [ORG]. We are considering the invitation. And once we have made a decision we will get back to [ORG] about who the speakers will be, and then we will be in a position to talk about it. The President has expressed more optimism about bipartisan -- Can you explain whether it is just [NORP] coming? Who is been invited and what the President's hopes are for that legislation? [INTERVIEWER1], I would anticipate that we will have a list of lawmakers who participate in that meeting. Both [NORP] and [NORP] were invited, and I would anticipate that there will be a bipartisan group of members at the meeting. The President, as you point out, does view this as an opportunity for us to find some common ground to move the country forward; that there are some [NORP] who have raised similar concerns that the President himself has discussed about our criminal justice system, about reforms that could make our system more consistent with our values of fairness and justice and equality that certainly the President believes are really important, and I know that many of the members -- that all the members who are participating in the meeting also believe are important. So this is an area that is worthy of careful consideration and consultation because there might be an opportunity for [ORG] to act in bipartisan fashion with the strong support of the President to put in place reforms to our system that would make our nation more just. So the President is looking forward to that discussion. I would anticipate that we will have, like I said, a list of the members who participate and at least a general overview of that meeting once it concludes. [INTERVIEWED1], [DATE], Governor [PERSON], after she met with [ORG], with the President, reported that the President said he was open to crude exports from the [GPE] Is that an accurate characterization of what the President told the governors? And is that sort of a shift in position from what he has previously said? I was not in the room when that exchange occurred, so it is hard for me to accurately reflect the way the question was asked and the way it was answered. What I can do, though, is assure you that the policy of the administration has not changed, that crude oil export regulations are administered by [ORG]. That is where these kinds of regulations are considered. And I do not have sort of change to announce at this point. Following up on [GPE], is it the administration's position that you would want a permanent agreement, one that has no timeline whatsoever, to meet the goal that you said repeatedly, which is to ensure there is never a development of a nuclear weapon? Well, I think what we want is we want an agreement that is verifiable and we certainly want one that all parties live up to. And again, in terms of what kind of time constraints are placed in the context of the negotiations and how long people would be signing up, that is not something I am going to prejudge or be in a position to talk about from here. Obviously, this is the subject of ongoing -- -- answer suggests that the administration is open to a timeline of some kind. It has to be one or the other. I recognize that. I guess what I am trying to say is I am just not going to be in a position to talk about the details of our negotiating position with the [NORP]. And the reason for that is simply that we have agreed on the front end with our international partners who are joining us at the table and with the [NORP] that we can have an open, candid dialogue in the context of these negotiations with the goal of trying to reach an agreement. And attempts to try to influence those negotiations by talking about them outside of the context of the negotiations are not going to be helpful to that process. But my point is, we will have an opportunity at some point, -- on or around [DATE], we will have an opportunity to discuss either the framework for an agreement that is been reached, or we will be able to discuss why we were not able to reach an agreement despite the common-sense, reasonable proposal that is been put forward by the international community. And your interest in understanding exactly what was put forward is a reasonable one, but one that I cannot discuss right now. Well, let me just ask you this: Have you reconciled in your own mind how you could describe to the country an agreement that had a timeline that also met the standard of [GPE] never obtaining a nuclear weapon? Well, again, once -- They are almost irreconcilable. Can both be true? Well, again, the most important thing is to figure out what exactly [GPE] will agree to, and understand whether or not -- -- whether or not [GPE] can obtain a nuclear weapon. -- and whether or not it will resolve the international community's concerns about their efforts to obtain a nuclear weapon. So that is the focal point of these negotiations. And again, once we are in a position to evaluate either an agreement that has been reached, or an offer that was made an then rejected by the [NORP], we can talk in more detail about the negotiating position that was assumed by [GPE] and our international partners, and how it was possible to reconcile that with the policy goals that we have stated, the most important of which you have reiterated here, which is to ensure that [GPE] does not obtain a nuclear weapon. On Secretary [PERSON] -- a couple of veterans groups have said they accept his apology, but said it raises questions in their minds about his trustworthiness. And they do not talk just about this, but they have also made mention of misstatements that the Secretary may have intentionally or unintentionally made about how many people have been fired and held accountable in some of the implementation of reforms. Is the President satisfied that Secretary [PERSON] is trustworthy and is, in fact, implementing all of the reforms and legislation he recently signed? The President believes that Secretary [PERSON] has a very difficult task in front of him to try to bring much-needed reforms to the [ORG]. And this is a task that generations of [ORG] secretaries have tried to accomplish. Many of them have made progress, and the President is pleased with the progress that Secretary [PERSON] has made so far. But again, this is a very difficult challenge. And the reason that Secretary [PERSON] has been successful so far is that not only does he bring with him some private sector management experience that I do think is useful when trying to get his arms around a large government agency like this and manage it efficiently, or at least as efficiently as possible, this task also reflects his own personal commitment to these issues that starts with his own military service to our country. But even after he left military service, Secretary [PERSON] was committed, even using his free time, to try to support military families, our veterans and their families. And that is a testament to his character. It is a testament to what drives him, and it is why he is well suited for this job. But I do not think there is anybody who sits around -- who wakes up in [TIME] thinking, boy, my job is really hard [DATE], I wish I could just go walk in [PERSON] shoes because that sure would be a weight off my shoulders. I think everybody recognizes that he is a got a very difficult task in front of him. And that is why his skill and personal commitment to these issues are so important to his success. When the [ORG] was in a lot of trouble, the President tasked [PERSON] to go over and assist. Is he still there? Is he still working in carrying out essentially a conduit role from [ORG] to the [ORG], and serving as that sort of presidential intermediary or liaison with this new Secretary? [PERSON] is still working at the [ORG] and is still providing the Secretary and other members of the senior leadership at the [ORG] the kind of advice and expertise that they continue to benefit from. So we certainly are pleased to have [PERSON] still serving his country and our veterans over at the [ORG]. Last question. Senator [PERSON] raised his concerns about the Choice Card, which is part of the legislation the President signed. We had a couple of questions at the budget briefing, but it does not appear that every member of [ORG] is satisfied that this Choice Card is going to be implemented in the budget and the financial flexibility is going to be there for veterans to obtain care outside of the system if they meet the criteria. Can you assure veterans, from this podium, that, in fact, financing will be there and the Choice Card will be implemented fully as written by [ORG]? Well, I am not intimately familiar with this issue, so let me take this question for the [ORG] and see if we can provide you some data to help you understand our position on this. [INTERVIEWED1], thanks. I want to take you back to [FAC] for a moment. Is there any way in your mind, if the process plays out -- you have made the point that this has sort of circumvented longstanding processes -- if they were to play out, in your mind, is there any way the President signs off on [FAC]? That possibility still does exist. This is an ongoing review that is being conducted by [ORG]. They are going to evaluate the impact that this project would have on the country. They are going to have the opportunity to evaluate the impact that this project would have on contributing to climate change. And it certainly is possible; the President will keep an open mind as [ORG] considers the wide range of impacts that this pipeline could have on the country, both positive and negative. And so we will see what happens once [ORG] has completed their - what is called the national interest determination - what essentially is a report evaluating whether or not the completion of this infrastructure project would be in the best interest of [GPE]. You said as far as [GPE] was concerned there is a deep, longstanding security relationship between our country and theirs. I am curious, as it relates to the [NORP] talks, is it fair to characterize a level of frustration on behalf of the administration to this notion that some people are cherry-picking bits and pieces and maybe as an outside actor attempting to influence the negotiations? Well, [INTERVIEWER1], I think you asked about this [DATE], I believe, where I did express some frustration that we have seen some people take information that they had obtained about the [GPE] negotiating position and cherry-pick information to try to distort the public impression of exactly what that negotiating position was. So that is why, at least, even in the context of the questions that I have taken [DATE], that I have been loathe to get into the details of the [GPE] negotiating position. Everybody will have an opportunity to evaluate that soon enough. But as the details come out, albeit you are saying they are not accurate, you can understand why many perhaps in [GPE] might say, you see, this is exactly what we were talking about to begin with. Well, I think what people around the globe can be confident of is that [GPE] is negotiating with one clear goal in mind, which is to make sure that [GPE] does not obtain a nuclear weapon. And we are working closely with the international community to achieve that goal. That was the goal of the sanctions regime that [ORG] passed and this administration implemented in close coordination with our allies around the globe, to compel the [NORP] to come to the negotiating table and try to resolve the international community's concerns with their nuclear program. And those talks are underway, and we certainly would not want anything that I say from here or any other efforts to try to distort our negotiating position to negatively impact our ability to try to bring those negotiations to conclusion in a way that yields a strong and verifiable agreement that is clearly in the best interest of not just [GPE] and not just [GPE] and not just our international negotiating partners, but is clearly in the best interest of the whole country -- or of the whole globe. Quick housekeeping. As far as [ORG] is concerned, there is [CARDINAL] chance that someone will not be going to [ORG], right? Well, again, they have extended an invitation to the administration; once we have decided how we are going to respond to the invitation, we will let them know. And then once we let them know, we will let all of you know. But you will accept it, someone is going, right? Somebody is going, right? I hear you. It does seem just as a matter of common courtesy, it seems like we should respond to their invitation first and then we can talk about it publicly. So you are not suggesting that no one is going? I certainly did not come close to saying that. Yes, you did. I want to ask a question a different way. Given the President is going to make obviously the final call on XL, is there no communication between [ORG] and [ORG] about when you might expect their report? Well, I do not know -- I cannot account for every single conversation that occurs between [ORG] and [ORG]. I think it is certainly possible that somebody in [ORG] has gotten an update in terms of how much longer it would take [ORG] to compete their review, but I am not aware of those conversations. But even if I were, I am not sure I'd be in a position to announce for [ORG] what their timeline is going to be. If they are prepared to announce a timeline then they will announce it. As you know, there are a lot of people anxious about this. They waited [DATE] and there are others who are concerned about a political implication for [DATE] depending on when the President does make his decision. Is the expectation that once the [ORG] report comes out, the President will make a decision fairly quickly? Does he feel like he needs to do that quickly? Well, I would not want to prejudge the outcome here, but I would anticipate that once the review has been completed that there would not be a significant delay in announcing the results of that review and ultimately making a decision on this project. But on [ORG], as you know, there are critics who have suggested that [ORG] has overstated the potential impact if there is a delay in funding, saying that because everyone who is essential will still be working that it will not make a significant difference to national security. [ORG] -- you and others have said that obviously an impact would occur. And we heard from some people, including the [ORG] Director [DATE], about what that would be. So given that, what kind of preparations are underway for a possible shutdown? And is [ORG] confident that [ORG] is ready, should that occur? Well, [PERSON], I can tell you that it is not just the administration who is making the case that shutting down [ORG] would have a bad impact on national security. I know that Congressman [PERSON] was on television [DATE] making exactly that case. So he does not often agree with the administration, but at least in this case he is making the same case that we are. He is not the only one who is making that case. I do know that [ORG] has been engaged in a planning process to ensure they are prepared and can take the steps necessary to try to mitigate the impact of a shutdown of that department. But as I have mentioned before, the impact of that shutdown will include [CARDINAL] of [ORG] personnel being furloughed. It will include many [ORG] officers showing up for work to protect their country but not getting a paycheck on time. And that does not seem particularly fair, and I am not sure why anybody thinks that would be a good outcome for the country. So we have been clear that this is not a good thing. But [ORG] is doing the responsible thing, which is, even as they try to talk to members of [ORG] and encourage them to fulfill their responsibility and pass a budget, they are also engaged in the planning to try to mitigate the potential impact of shutting down their agency. Can you give us a sense of what is involved in that planning? I cannot , but they probably can. A couple questions, [INTERVIEWED1]. [DATE], a [NORP] citizen was killed by [CARDINAL] police officers in [GPE], [GPE]. Is the President aware of the incident? Or [ORG]? What is his reaction to that? Can you say it [CARDINAL] more time? A [NORP] citizen was killed in [GPE], [GPE], the state of [GPE]. My question was, was the President aware of the incident, or [ORG], and what is the reaction to that? I have certainly seen the news reports. I have not talked to the President about it. I do not know if he is aware, although knowing he is an avid consumer of news, I assume that he is. But I do not know a lot of the details of the case beyond what I have read in news reports. So for questions about sort of where that investigation stands, I'd refer you to the local authorities there. I have a question about [GPE]. You said earlier that you continue to be concerned by these violations. And the President said when [PERSON] was visiting that if [GPE] continued to do this he would seriously consider sending arms to the [NORP] government and also possibly increasing the sanctions. So you are seeing these violations. Now what are you going to do? Well, what we are doing right now is we are continuing to support the ongoing efforts to try to implement this agreement. And I know that there was a call that was scheduled among the foreign ministerial level of the [CARDINAL] groups that have been involved in these negotiations -- the [NORP], the [NORP], the [NORP] and the [NORP] -- [DATE]? I believe that was [DATE] -- I do not know if it was [DATE] or [DATE], but I know that those efforts are ongoing and we continue to support them. And the consequences that you cited of failing to live up to those kinds of commitments continue to be on the table. So we are going to continue to closely watch the situation with the President, the Vice President, and other senior members of the team, continue to be in close touch with our partners who are working this situation and we are going to monitor it closely. But certainly there is the potential of offering additional assistance to the [NORP] military or ramping up our sanctions regime against the [NORP]. Look, right now they are violating it. How long will they go on violating it until you do something? I am just wondering, how long do you give this process? I mean, they are not living up to it now. You are monitoring it. How long are you going to monitor the violations before you do something? We will we are going to continue to try to work diplomatically to resolve this situation. And that has been our approach from the beginning, which is that it is our view that the only way we are going to resolve this is not with a military solution but with a diplomatic solution. And that is why we are continuing to press that option. But, you are right, at some point you have to start considering some other alternatives, which is why [GPE] has already provided substantial military assistance to the [NORP] military. It is why we have already worked with our partners in Europe to put in place a sanctions regime and isolate President [PERSON] and -- or [NORP] political leadership. And that was a response to their earlier violations of generally accepted international norms. But, yes, the potential of increasing our assistance to [GPE] and increasing the costs that are sustained by [GPE] has the potential to be implemented. But we are going to continue to watch this and make decisions accordingly. Well, is it also possible that these violations could continue and you decide to do nothing else? Well, I think our level of pessimism is not quite that high, but we will -- You say there is the potential that you might do something else. That is right. I am just wondering, if the violations continue, might you also decide that it is not worth doing anything else on sanctions? Based on our past response to [GPE]'s provocations and failure to live up to generally accepted international principles, I think you could rightly conclude that it is unlikely that that is the outcome. But as we see [GPE] continue to destabilize eastern [GPE] and continue to take steps that are clearly in violation of agreements that they have signed, that the risk of further sanctions only increases. [INTERVIEWED1], I want to come back to [GPE] [CARDINAL] more time. I just want to be clear about what you are denying. You are denying that [GPE] has proposed a [DATE] agreement, is that right? My understanding of the reports -- that I will confess that I have not seen firsthand -- but my understanding of the reports indicate that -- they wrongly indicate that the agreement that is being negotiated right now will be [DATE] in length, and that is not our negotiating position at all. But you are not denying that there is some substantially longer agreement of which there is a [DATE] opening phase to it, right? Well, what I am reluctant to do is to sort of wade in on a detailed assessment of where the negotiations currently stand. I am not asking for details. Just are you denying something longer? That is certainly more detail than we have talked about so far. But again, we will have an opportunity in [DATE] to consider either to evaluate an agreement that is been reached, or to evaluate an agreement that the [NORP] walked away from. But suffice it to say [GPE] continues to negotiate from the position that there should be an opportunity for the [NORP] to ease the international community's concerns about their nuclear program to, in a verifiable way, make clear to the international community that they will not acquire a nuclear weapon. The [NORP] have said many times that that is consistent with their view and with their national policy. It is the view of the international community that they just need to be able to verify that for the international community. And ultimately, if we can come to an agreement around those outlines that would be a good outcome for not just [GPE] and [GPE], but it would be good for the world. Can we follow on this? Go ahead, [PERSON]. At this point, would you still call on Prime Minister [PERSON] to cancel the speech before the [ORG]? And if so, would the President meet with [PERSON]? [PERSON], we have not called on Prime Minister [PERSON] to cancel his speech. And we have indicated the reason that the President will not meet with him during this visit to [GPE] is that it comes [DATE] before his election. And in order to avoid even the appearance of interfering with a democratic election in another country, the President will not meet with the Prime Minister. But I would anticipate that at some point after the elections, regardless of who wins, that the President will convene a meeting with the leader of [GPE] and will continue the very close coordination on security issues that has characterized his relationship thus far with Prime Minister [PERSON]. As [GPE] and her allies try to come to an agreement with [GPE] about its nuclear ambitions, what is this administration doing -- how is it engaged to reduce nuclear weapons in nations that actually do have these weapons, like [GPE] and [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], et cetera? Well, [INTERVIEWER1], the President -- I think each of those situations is a little bit different. But we certainly have even worked closely with [GPE] to reduce our nuclear stockpile, and this is something that the President did early in his tenure. And that, he believes, is in the best interest of not just [GPE] national security, but also the safety of citizens and people around the globe. But, certainly, we continue to be focused on these issues. [DATE], a federal judge appointed by President [PERSON] issued an injunction on a separate immigration executive action, specifically stopping the detention of migrants coming across the border in [GPE]. Is [ORG] going to seek a stay of this injunction in the same way they are seeking a stay -- I'd encourage you to check with [ORG] about sort of the next step in that legal process. I do know that the issue in question in that legal proceeding was related to our efforts to address what at the time was a rather urgent situation that we saw a substantial number of unaccompanied minors at the southern border attempting to illegally enter [GPE]. And [CARDINAL] of our efforts to try to respond to that situation was to detain recent border-crossers near the border, and to try to find an environment in which families could be detained together, and to try to make sure that we are doing that in the most humane way possible. So I know that there are some who raised concerns about that policy, but that is what the administration believed was an appropriate way to respond to that urgent situation. Since that time, we have seen the numbers of undocumented immigrants, particularly unaccompanied minors, in that sector of the border decline substantially. And that is thanks to the comprehensive strategy that this administration has put in place, working with [NORP] countries, working with our partners in [GPE], and stepping up some of our law enforcement capabilities on the border to try to address the situation. And that situation has -- or at least the urgency of the situation down there has subsided dramatically. -- your administration argued that this detention served as a deterrent to make sure that was not another ongoing flood of migrants. That is part of the comprehensive strategy you just mentioned. Is the administration at all concerned now that this deterrent is gone, that you will see another wave of migrants? Well, it certainly was not the only deterrent. I think the most effective deterrent that we have is to have the President of [GPE] making very clear that people in Central America should not send their kids on this very dangerous journey; that too often, we saw reports of kids who did not complete the journey safely, that they were killed. This is a very dangerous trek. In some cases, we saw the kids were actually funneled into human trafficking rings. So we have continued to make the case very clearly and very publicly that parents should not even contemplate to putting their kids in the hands of human traffickers in trying to move them into [GPE] illegally. So we have been really clear about that, and that is probably the most effective deterrent that we have. But to the extent that other things can also deter and reinforce that message, we obviously want to support them. [ORG] sent a letter to [PERSON], scoring the President's executive actions for DACA and DAPA, and it found that his executive actions would actually increase budget deficits by [MONEY] over [DATE]. I was wondering if you could square that [ORG] finding with the President's budget, which claims immigration reform and executive actions would reduce the budget. We may have to follow up with you on this, because my reading of that report was actually that removing the executive actions would actually add [MONEY] to the deficit. Off-budget, you are right. That is if we do not consider -- that is if the payroll taxes from the [ORG] and [ORG] recipients did not go to the [ORG] trust fund. But if the [ORG] trust fund exists, if those payroll taxes are going to the [ORG] trust fund, then that [ORG] letter found that the immigration actions do add to the deficit by [MONEY] over [DATE]. Well, I may have somebody who is more steeped in the budgetary details. My understanding is that this would have a positive impact on our deficit precisely because for the first time what we'd be doing is we'd be bringing people out of the shadows and actually making them pay taxes. That would be a good thing for the life of [ORG]. It would be a good thing for our economy. And ultimately, it would be a good thing for the deficit. But we can have somebody follow up with you on your -- on what may be a more detailed question. Thank you very much. [INTERVIEWER1]. [INTERVIEWED1], back on [FAC], does President [PERSON] believe that [DATE] is a reasonable length of time for [ORG] to conduct an evaluation? Well, I think it is certainly fair to suggest that [ORG] is conducting an in-depth review. The other thing that is also true is that there have been some legal proceedings that have interfered with the completion of this review. There was this long-running court case in [GPE] about the proper route of the pipeline. And that certainly did impact [ORG] ability to evaluate the route of the pipeline since it was not finalized and was subject to this ultimate court ruling. But within [DATE] the [GPE] court has issued a decision that has finalized the proposal, and now that final proposal can be evaluated by [ORG]. That is what they are doing right now. Can you imagine what he would say if he gave you an assignment and you said, I will get back to you in [DATE]? I cannot . I cannot . Thank you. I will give you the last one, [INTERVIEWER1]. [CARDINAL] questions here. [CARDINAL], when [DATE] Prime Minister [PERSON] came to [GPE], [DATE] -- and including at [ORG] and at [ORG], at the [ORG] he announced that [GPE] should be a member of [ORG], and which President in [GPE] also announced and endorsed. What is happening with that membership? And also Prime Minister [PERSON] addressed in [GPE] [ORG] and calling on the Fortune 500 companies make in [GPE], which will create [CARDINAL] of jobs in the [GPE] and [CARDINAL] of jobs in [GPE]. So what is happening with that issue? And the [CARDINAL] leaders also set up a hotline. The [CARDINAL] have spoken ever since his visit to [FAC]? [INTERVIEWER1], I can tell you as it relates to [GPE]'s membership on [ORG], I know the President endorsed them acceding to [ORG] in the context of a variety of other important reforms to the operations of [ORG]. I do not have an update for you on the status of those ongoing reforms, or at least efforts to try to bring about some of those reforms. But I am sure my colleagues in Ambassador [PERSON]'s office can give you some additional information on this. [INTERVIEWER1], the President often discusses his view that we need to have more products that are stamped with [ORG] and that that would be good for the [GPE] economy. It would be good for job creation. The President also does believe that, as [NORP] consumers have the opportunity to buy [NORP] goods, that it could be good for the [NORP] economy, as well. So the President did have the opportunity to discuss some of these economic issues and our trade relationship with [GPE]. In the context of his visit to [GPE] [DATE], the President spent a lot of time with Prime Minister [PERSON] and they spent a lot of time talking about some of these economic issues. You will recall that there was a CEO summit in the context of those meeting, and that there were [NORP] and [NORP] business leaders that spent some time talking through some of these issues. And the President himself had the opportunity to sit down at a roundtable with [CARDINAL] of them and talk about some of the challenges that they face as they try to do more business together in a way that benefits the economies and job creation in both countries. So there is an opportunity for us to try to advance the interests of both our countries by working together and by coordinating our efforts. And the President is certainly committed to that, again, in part, because the substantial economic benefits that could be enjoyed by the [NORP] people. And that ultimately is his goal. I know that Prime Minister [PERSON] has a similar interest. And I do not know of any recent conversations that they have had, but that continues to be a priority of both the President and his administration. Second, [INTERVIEWED1], as far as the immigration is concerned, when President issued executive order [CARDINAL] of people were happy in that they will come out of the shadow. Now they are confused. What message you think President has for them? They are waiting to come out of the shadow and apply for their status. Well, [INTERVIEWER1], this is something that we are concerned about. The President does believe and we have said on many occasions that we believe that there is a very clear precedent for the executive actions the President announced at [DATE]; that taking executive action to try to address some elements of our broken immigration system is consistent with the way that Presidents of both parties for [DATE] have used their executive authority. And there is no doubt that these kinds of changes would be good for our economy, would be good for job creation, and would be good for bringing about greater accountability to our immigration system. And that ultimately is what the President believes is the benefit here -- that we can bring [CARDINAL] of people out of the shadows, that we can make them submit to a background check, that they will pay taxes, and that they can also get a work permit and they can start contributing to this country in a way that does not require them to live in fear of being deported at a moment's notice and separated from their families. Now, this, of course, does not apply to people who have recently crossed the border. In fact, we want to focus our enforcement efforts on people who have recently crossed the border and on others who may pose a threat to community safety or national security. But that is the crux of this debate, and we are going to continue to move this through the legal process because we are confident that the strongest legal arguments around on our side. Thanks, everybody.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretaryjaycarney234", "text": "Good [DATE], everyone. Thanks for being here. Hope you had [DATE], hot as it was. Before I take your questions, let me tell you that on [DATE], as part of his Middle Class Jobs and Opportunity Tour, the President will travel to [ORG] in [GPE], [GPE] to deliver remarks and experience firsthand the school's cutting-edge curriculum through digital learning. In his State of the Union address, the President laid out his belief that the middle class is the engine of economic growth in our country. To reignite that engine, there are [CARDINAL] areas we need to invest in: jobs, skills, and opportunity. We need to build on the progress we have made over [DATE], and that means investing in those areas that are already creating good-paying, stable jobs that can support a middle-class family. With that, I will take your questions. [PERSON]. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED1]. I wanted to get [ORG] response to what is happening in [GPE] right now, particularly [PERSON] questioning the legitimacy of the protestors in what seems to be an increased police reaction to those protests. Thank you for the question. We continue to follow the events in [GPE] closely and with concern. As we stated from the outset [DATE], [GPE] supports full freedom of expression and assembly, including the right to peaceful protest, as fundamental to any democracy. We believe that the vast majority of the protestors have been peaceful, law-abiding, ordinary citizens exercising their rights. [GPE] has serious concerns about the reports of excessive use of force by police and large numbers of injuries and damage to property. We call on these events to be investigated and to urge all parties to refrain from provoking violence. Has the President spoken with [PERSON] since these protests started? He has not. I have no calls to report. I refer you to [ORG] for any outreach that they might have had with the [NORP], but no calls from here to report. And just more broadly, given [GPE] is important to so many of the issues that the [GPE] deals with in that part of the world, how key is stability in [GPE] to the President? [GPE] is a very important ally. And look, all democracies have issues that they need to work through and we would expect the government to work through this in a way that respects the rights of their citizens. I think that we continue to work with [GPE] on a range of issues -- as a [ORG] ally and as a key player in the region -- and we look forward to doing that. And just on a totally separate topic -- [PERSON] over [DATE] called you a paid liar for the administration. I wanted to give you an opportunity to respond to his comment. I had not heard that. That is amazing. I am not going to get into a back and forth with Chairman [PERSON]. I think that what our focus is and has been is the need to find out all the inappropriate activity that occurred; make sure, as the President insists, that those who are responsible for inappropriate, outrageous activity be held accountable; that processes are put into place at the [ORG] so that something like this cannot happen again. The President acted, as you know, in response to the independent Inspector General's report by making clear that he was outraged by the behavior; by acting quickly to install new leadership at the [ORG]; by instructing that new leadership to conduct a thorough review that would examine the behavior, hold those accountable who were responsible for it, and to examine the overall culture at the [ORG] to make sure that these kinds of things cannot happen again. I would note that when I spoke about the situation I was referring to the findings of the independent Inspector General, who -- let us be clear -- said that he both in testimony and in his report found no evidence that outsiders -- those outside the [ORG] -- influenced the behavior that took place there. That is the conclusion of the independent Inspector General, and we certainly have seen no other evidence to contradict that. However, the President is interested in getting all the facts, and that is why he has instructed that the new leadership at the [ORG] conduct this review. We are interested in legitimate congressional oversight. That is an important component in a situation like this to finding all the facts and making sure that remedial action is taken. And, as you know, there is a criminal investigation that is being undertaken by [ORG]. So I think there is ample demonstration of this administration's interest in getting all the facts and holding those who are responsible accountable. To follow up on [GPE], does the unrest in [GPE] make it harder to deal with the [GPE] situation? Well, we work very closely with [GPE] on the situation in [GPE], with our allies and partners in the region, and we will continue to do that. I believe, as I said, that the -- we expect and we believe that the [NORP] government will appropriately work through this situation. We call on the events that occurred to be investigated and urge all parties to refrain from provoking violence. And we think that the right of free expression and assembly, those rights are fundamental to democracy. And we have concerns about some of the response, but we certainly expect the [NORP] government to work through this. There was a story in the paper over [DATE] saying there was some displeasure inside [ORG] with [PERSON]. Does the President feel like [PERSON] is becoming a distraction? It is important to note that, I believe in the article you are referring to, the Chief of Staff was quoted on the record, and in that statement he spoke for the President and he spoke for all of us. And he said that, The President and his team at [ORG] believe that the Attorney General has the intellect, experience, and integrity to efficiently run [ORG] and not get distracted by the partisans who seem more interested in launching political attacks than cooperating with him to protect the security and constitutional rights of the [NORP] people. And I think I could not say it any better, so I quoted the Chief of Staff saying it. Just to button down the [PERSON] thing, finally -- they point specifically to [CARDINAL] instances in the briefing where you said on [DATE], referred to apparent conduct by our [ORG] officials in [GPE]; and on [DATE], line [ORG] employees in [GPE] improperly scrutinized 501- organizations. When you made those statements -- Those are the findings of the audit conducted by the independent Inspector General, correct? Those are the findings, right? I was citing -- and perhaps there are issues that the Chairman has with the IG. I was citing the findings of the independent Inspector General. As you recall, we waited for that report to be released before responding. The President responded I think with appropriate concern and took immediate action, and is continuing to direct those who are responsible for these matters to take action. Again, the Inspector General concluded in his report and testified to this before [ORG] that he found no evidence of outside influence on the behavior that was of such great concern to all of us at the [ORG]. It is also important to note the President has instructed the new acting commissioner of the [ORG] to conduct a review that looks at this activity; holds responsible those who were responsible for it -- holds accountable those who are responsible for it; and takes measures to ensure that it cannot happen again. Separately, we are cooperating with legitimate congressional oversight. Separately, [ORG] has launched a criminal investigation. So I think it is important to stick to the facts, look at the work that has been done and build on it -- which is what this President wants to do, what the new acting commissioner wants to do, the [ORG] Secretary wants to do. And we certainly hope that that is what the congressional oversight committees hope to do. [PERSON], [TIME], called on [PERSON] to apologize to you. Do you expect or want an apology? And is this the kind of language you think is productive? I appreciate those who have spoken in my defense, but I would simply say that I am not interested in having a back and forth with Chairman [PERSON]. I am interested in what the President is interested in, in this matter, which is that we take action to ensure that this activity does not happen again; we take action to hold accountable those who are responsible for it; we cooperate with legitimate congressional oversight; and we obviously cooperate with any investigation that [ORG] is undertaking. Those are the things that matter here. And, again, I do not want to get into a back and forth. And just finally, [DATE], [PERSON] sent out a Tweet that is pretty inflammatory in itself, bringing up old allegations against [PERSON]. Is that the kind of back and forth that is actually productive, moving the agenda forward? I would simply say that I am not interested in that back and forth -- or having a back and forth with the Chairman. I, again, as I think we have just discussed, spoke very carefully and specifically about the findings of the independent Inspector General in his lengthy review of the conduct at the [ORG]. I spoke, in fact, quite clearly that we have seen no evidence that contradicts the findings of the independent Inspector General. I would point you to the testimony of the former [ORG] Commissioner that makes clear the lack of involvement of people outside of the [ORG], to his knowledge and in his view. And, again, we have no information that would contradict that. The President's focus is on taking action to hold accountable those who are responsible for this behavior, taking action to ensure that it never happens again, because it is very important that the [NORP] people have faith that the [ORG] applies our tax laws fairly across the country. And that is why he was so outraged by the actions that were reported by the Inspector General, and that is why he has acted in response in the way that he has. So, [INTERVIEWED1], on a different [ORG] subject -- has the President seen the [ORG] report -- it was supposed to come out [DATE] -- which talks about waste at the [ORG] and it talks about, in fact, the [ORG] employees using presidential suites at conferences. Does the President think that is appropriate? No. Well, in answer to your question, we have not seen the report, but, no, he does not think that conduct is appropriate. I would point you to statements released by the acting [ORG] Commissioner, [PERSON], who says, This conference is an unfortunate vestige from a prior era. Taxpayers should take comfort that a conference like this would not take place [DATE]. Sweeping new spending restrictions have been put place at the [ORG], and travel and training expenses have dropped [PERCENT] since [DATE], and similar large-scale meetings did not take place in [DATE], [DATE], or [DATE]. And, second, I would point out that the President has made creating an efficient and effective government a priority, a cornerstone of his administration. He believes that everyone in this administration must take their role as stewards of the taxpayer dollar very seriously. That is why in [DATE] the administration outlined a series of actions for reining in spending and increasing both transparency and oversight of federal conference and travel activity. The federal government spending on travel, which includes conference activity, was reduced by [MONEY] in [DATE] as compared to [DATE]. On travel spending, agencies have lowered their spending on travel -- compared to [DATE] levels -- by [MONEY]. [ORG], for example, reduced travel costs by [MONEY]. [ORG] implemented mandatory policy guidance requiring employees to use lowest-available fares for air travel, and due to this policy alone, [ORG] achieved [MONEY] in savings in [DATE]. These are examples that illustrated a commitment the President has to wringing out waste and abuse of taxpayer dollars. And it is important to note that [PERSON], who is now the acting commissioner over at the [ORG], oversaw that process at the [ORG] when he was at the [ORG]. How important is this to [ORG], a report like this, because of the confidence that is needed in the [ORG] in order to perform its duties? It does not have enough agents to investigate all of us. It depends upon public trust. Are you concerned that public trust is, in fact, being hurt by both of these scandals? And especially, is, in fact, the [ORG] a broken agency at this time that needs a thorough review? The answer is the President is very concerned by the activity that has been reported by the independent Inspector General with regards to the targeting of conservative groups applying for tax exempt status. He is concerned by -- and has been -- excessive spending by the [ORG] and other agencies when it comes to conferences and travel, and has taken action accordingly. It is very important, and your question implies this, that the [NORP] people have faith that the [ORG] in particular is applying our tax laws in a fair and responsible way. And that is why he has ordered a review after installing new leadership at the [ORG], and he expects that review to be unsparing and to hold accountable people who are responsible for inappropriate conduct. And we will also cooperate with congressional oversight, and we, of course, will cooperate with [ORG] criminal investigation into this matter. But it is precisely because of the President's concern that he articulated right away after the [ORG] report was released that these actions are being undertaken. Do you believe that Chairman [PERSON] is contributing to trust in the [ORG] with his oversight by insisting he believes the orders to target conservative groups came out of [GPE]? Again, I do not want to get into a back and forth. We believe that there is an important role to be played by [ORG] through legitimate oversight. We take this matter very seriously, which is why the President has ordered the actions that he has ordered, and why the new acting commissioner of the [ORG] is proceeding with the review that this President and the Secretary of the [ORG] committed him to perform. It is why we will cooperate with both congressional oversight and [ORG] investigations -- because this is a serious matter and it needs to be addressed. And that is our focus. And I think that when it comes to getting the facts, we need to get them and not make judgments before we have all the facts. And I think that that is why we made the decision to wait for the publication of the independent Inspector General's report. Even though the issue itself had become public and there was a great demand for comment on it, we believed it was the right thing to do not to comment on it before it was public because it would have been inappropriate in our view to in any way intervene in a process that was not complete. And that is what we did. And when that report became public, the President acted very quickly and he spoke very clearly about his outrage over this conduct. Is the [ORG] exercising legitimate oversight? Do you see legitimate oversight? Again, I am not going to get into a play-by-play or a review of congressional activity day by day, but I believe that congressional oversight -- we believe that congressional oversight is important when it is legitimate, and we think that this is a matter that should be looked at by [ORG] through the process of legitimate congressional oversight. But we think it is important to stay focused on what we know, what the facts are, the information we know from the report conducted by the independent Inspector General, and then to build on that through the review being overseen by the new commissioner at the [ORG], through the congressional oversight role and through the investigation undertaken by [ORG]. On another subject -- can you comment on [PERSON] book indicating that the President has agreed to support his former Secretary of [ORG] in [DATE]? I confess that I was not aware of that report, but I will run out and buy the book or purchase it online. I can assure you the President is not thinking about the next presidential election, having just recently won the last one. Yes. If I could ask you quickly, [INTERVIEWED1], about the -- considering [ORG] fierce efforts to try to stop leaks in terms of national security secrets and the like, [DATE], [PERSON] trial begins and I wanted to get a sense from you. His attorney said just a short time ago -- he described him as a young, nave, but well-intentioned man. What is [ORG] perspective on [PERSON], given the fact that you guys are prosecuting this -- the administration is? Inherent in your question is the recognition that there is an ongoing trial, so I could not comment on an ongoing trial. I would refer you to the prosecutors in [ORG] on that matter. It is certainly our view -- broadly speaking, not referring to any specific case -- that leaks of national security -- sensitive national security information, classified information, can be very harmful to our national security interests. I want to ask you quickly about the comments we heard from the President a short time ago as part of this mental health conference taking place [DATE]. He said that the [ORG] is partnering with [CARDINAL] communities in [CARDINAL] states to help, among other things, reduce wait times, to provide better access to mental health care for veterans; that they have recently hired [CARDINAL] mental health providers and there are going to be, I think, [CARDINAL] summits that he referred to [DATE]. How is that going to be paid for? I would have to refer you to [ORG] and to the [ORG]. I do not have that information for you. I think that mental health is an important issue that is often stigmatized. It is a component of our gun violence problem. That is why this conference was a piece of the executive action, a portion of the report that the Vice President put together and the President has acted on when it comes to reducing gun violence in [GPE]. But, obviously, it touches on a range of issues that -- not just limited to gun violence, but a range of issues. And then on that topic, is [ORG] concerned that furloughs that we have now learned are taking place already at [ORG], I think at [FAC], that [CARDINAL] 500 civil employees are going to be furloughed at those places? That accounts for [PERCENT] at [ORG]. Are you concerned about the impact that will have on services for veterans, including mental health? Well, I do not know enough about the specific breakdowns of the furloughs and the effects or impacts in different areas to say with any specificity about what harm might be done. It is certainly the case that the furloughs caused by sequester are having effects across the country -- real consequences for real people. We have seen it in reports about the elimination, in some cases, of [ORG] programs or the sharp reduction in the provision of [ORG] programs for seniors. We have seen it in the elimination of slots for [ORG] children. And certainly we are seeing it in areas affected by the [ORG] budget. And we knew that this would be the case, and that is why implementing bad policy was always a bad idea -- not something to be celebrated, not something to call a political victory for the tea party or any party, because there are real people who suffer the consequences of these arbitrary, across-the-board cuts -- unnecessary cuts in the sense that we can and should do better by making wise decisions about how we reduce our deficit, reducing it in a balanced way, the way that the President has been forward again and again in his budget proposals and in his offers to [NORP] leaders on [ORG]. So this does not have to happen. It did not need to happen. And the President certainly hopes that we can reach a compromise on budget issues that prevents this from continuing to happen. And the final topic is immigration. [PERSON] said, I think on [ORG] , that he basically predicted by [DATE] that [CARDINAL] senators would pass a bipartisan immigration bill through the [ORG], acknowledging there are going to be some challenges when it reaches the [ORG]. [PERSON], though, [DATE] said that the immigration bill needs improvements to pass. So I am curious what improvements the President thinks need to be made to help this pass. I'd say a few things. [CARDINAL], the President continues to be encouraged by the progress being made in the [ORG] on comprehensive immigration reform. That process has now passed through committee, and we look forward to a robust debate and expect the legislation to move forward in a timely manner. As we have said, the [ORG] legislation may not contain every specific element we have called for, but it does represent an important step towards the broad principles the President has made clear need to be part of common-sense immigration reform. And so we look forward to continuing to work with [ORG] as the bill moves forward, and we will continue to advance the President's priorities as part of that process. But that process is ongoing; a lot of work remains to be done. We believe that the bill that emerged from committee reflects the President's principles, and we believe that the bill that passes through the [ORG], with bipartisan support, should and needs to reflect the President's principles. And we will be engaged in that process as it moves through the [ORG] and beyond. But I think it is important to note that there is a lot of work to be done here, and we have seen with a variety of issues over time that victory can be declared early. And this is real work because it is something that requires bipartisan broad support. That support exists, the President believes, but it requires some elbow grease and some real grit and determination to get from here to completion. [INTERVIEWED1], [TIME] you mentioned the reductions in government travel costs. Is there any effort on the part of the President to reduce travel costs -- his travel costs? Well, broadly speaking, [ORG], as you know, has been affected by this sequester, and measures have been taken both to reduce costs here, as well as we have had to have furloughs in [ORG]. The President is President of [GPE] [TIME] a day and [DATE], as was the case with every one of the President's predecessors. And the nature of -- the way that he travels is very much a part of the office that he holds and is a requirement of that office, and he needs to be able to conduct his presidency in order to fulfill his obligation to the [NORP] people and the oath he took. So we are, in a variety of ways that I think [ORG] and others have spelled out, and I can -- and we can get you more information on that if you'd like -- taking action to reduce costs to deal with the sequester and some of that action includes furloughs. But I do not have anything more specific for you on that. Thank you. [DATE], the President meets with the President of [GPE] out in [GPE]. It is supposed to be partly a getting-acquainted session, but the President is also going to be bringing up hacking -- computer hacking and so forth. Does the President want to come away from that meeting with some deliverables? Well, I would, first of all, make the point that the President is acquainted with President [PERSON]. They met prior to President [PERSON]'s accession to the presidency. But it is important now that he holds that office and President [PERSON] has recently been reelected for this meeting to take place. And President [PERSON] very much looks forward to it. There is a broad array of topics that the [CARDINAL] leaders will discuss, and certainly, cybersecurity will be [CARDINAL] of them. I would say that this is a discussion, and we are not trying to telegraph specific actions or so-called deliverables. The relationship that we have with [GPE] is broad and complex, and it is very important for these kinds of meetings to take place for that relationship to be developed, for us to work on greater cooperation where we have been able to cooperate, find new areas to cooperate, and also confront directly those areas where we disagree. And that has been the approach of this administration in our relations with [GPE] from the time the President took office. And we believe it is the right approach. Mr. [PERSON] was over there. Did he come back saying it is going to be really tough on -- talking on this subject? National Security Advisor [PERSON] had an excellent visit to [GPE] where he met with an array of top government officials and military officials and obviously reported back to the President on that meeting. And the President's meeting with President [PERSON] will build upon the meetings that National Security Advisor [PERSON] had. But again, I think that Mr. [PERSON] felt that his visit was a successful one. On [DATE], is there a legislative tie-in to this visit other than calling attention to this curriculum? Is he going to be asking [ORG] to do something specific? What is the -- I do not want to preview the event or the President's remarks more than I just did except to say broadly that, yes, the President believes [ORG] should be focused on what the [NORP] people are focused on. What specifically is he -- Again, I am not going to preview specifics from the President's event or the remarks, but there are a variety of actions that we believe [ORG] ought to join us in moving on. You heard the President address some of those, I believe, in his [DATE] address. And there is ample room for bipartisan action on an agenda that would strengthen the middle class, provide it more security and help it expand. And the middle class -- middle-class opportunity is the absolute cornerstone of our economy, and it has been the primary focus of the President's domestic policy since [DATE] he took office. It is the primary focus of his economic and domestic agenda in his second term. And it is an important thing to remember that even as we deal with an array of issues here in [GPE], that this is the thing -- this is the set of issues that the [NORP] people broadly care most deeply about because it affects their capacity to have and keep a job that can sustain a middle-class life; their capacity to send their children to college; their capacity to take care of their mothers and fathers as they grow old. And the President is deeply concerned about and focused on the need to make the middle class more secure and to create more opportunity for the middle class. So that is why this event is taking place on [DATE]. It is part of a series that he will be engaged in, and he absolutely expects [ORG] to join him in taking action to assist and empower the middle class. To that end, could you tell us if the shrinking of the deficit is making it harder for the President to get the bipartisan deal that he wants with [NORP] in order to make all the investments that he talks about on these trips? I mean, he is been searching for people to negotiate with him, but the deficit is coming down without either side doing anything. So is that having an effect? Let me take issue with that last sentence, because the deficit is coming down as sharply as it has been because the President and [ORG] did do something. They took direct action in [DATE] that prevented a catastrophic recession from becoming a depression. They took direct action to pass the Affordable Care Act, which has, by any measure, helped bring down the growth in the cost of health care. They took direct action to write and pass a Wall Street reform law that will ensure that the kind of financial crisis that so battered our economy and the global economy cannot happen again. They took direct action to save the [NORP] automobile industry, an industry that is very much a part of [NORP] history and our sense of who we are, and also a great engine for economic growth and job creation. So let me be clear about that. But the President thinks we need to continue to take action to invest in our economy so it grows -- to ensure that the jobs we need for [DATE] are created here; to ensure that we are taking action to enhance our energy independence; and to reduce our deficit in a responsible way -- to continue to reduce our deficit in a responsible way. And he has had a number of conversations with [NORP] lawmakers about the need to find common ground on achieving just that. But he has always looked at it as part of an overall approach to economic policy that is focused first and foremost on economic growth and job creation; and as part of that project, responsible deficit reduction. So he believes that we can do that. He believes that there are [NORP] who want to do that, and we just have to see if there is a coalescing of will to make it happen. You have seen the President's offers. They were very explicit in his budget -- very explicit in his budget as a reflection of the offer he made at [DATE]. And the offer is on the table, and it demonstrates the President's willingness to compromise, demonstrates the seriousness with which he approaches these issues, and he hopes that he will find partners in moving it forward. [DATE], a lot of attention was paid to the so-called charm offensive . The President took [NORP] lawmakers out to dinner and had meetings with them and called them on the phone. And I am wondering if that outreach has continued, or was that sort of a [CARDINAL]-time, kind of [CARDINAL]-moment deal? Well, first of all, it cannot be [CARDINAL] time if there were a series of meetings and conversations and dinners. Those conversations continue. It was fairly recently that Senator [PERSON] -- who is obviously a leading [NORP] in the [ORG] and a major player on a variety of key issues, both domestic and national security -- was here visiting the President. And we will continue to have those engagements both at the presidential level and at the sub-presidential level. The President is sincere in this effort. He believes that we can find common ground, both on deficit reduction and budget issues as well as on immigration reform -- because some of these conversations and meetings the President has had with [NORP] lawmakers have not just been on deficit reduction and budgets, they have been on immigration reform. They were and will continue to be, hopefully, on ways we can reduce gun violence. They will be on and have been on ways that we can invest in our economy and build out our infrastructure to create jobs [DATE] and help our economy grow in the future. So that effort continues. Are there some more recent engagements you can tell us about? You mean in [DATE]? You cannot declare something over after [DATE], [PERSON]. I think that we need to -- everybody needs to take a breath. And I know that the media cycle is what it is, but the President is fully engaged with members of [ORG] in both parties and will continue to be. And he has pressed with -- in every one of these meetings, for a willingness to find common ground. He has shown his willingness to compromise, and he has been encouraged by the sentiments expressed by some [NORP] lawmakers to do the same. And where there are opportunities to find that compromise and get something done on behalf of the [NORP] people, the President will seize them, and he will continue to have those conversations in search of them. I want to go back to [GPE]. It was not clear to me from your answer to [PERSON]'s question whether there will be deliverables come out of that. And just what would you expect to come out of it? Would there be some sort of a joint statement? Any appearance? Can you tell us anything about the format over [DATE] [TIME] and [DATE]? Well, we will have more details about the specifics of the engagements and the conversations. But the [CARDINAL] Presidents plan to discuss the full range of diplomatic, economic and security issues on the [GPE] agenda -- from the perspective of identifying shared interests and finding ways to work together to solve regional and global challenges, and discussing how to manage differences in a manner that ensures a stable and productive bilateral relationship. They will talk about their domestic economic situations -- these are the [CARDINAL] largest economies in the world -- and the steps that each will take to promote sustained international -- sustained, rather, and balanced global growth because of the impact that these [CARDINAL] economies have on global growth. I think it is important, while I wanted to assure [PERSON] that it was not just a get-to-know-you session, that this is more -- it is deeper than that; that this is not a [DATE]-style summit where there are pre-negotiated outcomes. This is very much part of an ongoing engagement that we have with the [NORP] leadership at the presidential level and at all the levels in government. And it is very important, because of the size of our economies, the interdependence that we have as engines of global economic growth, the various issues where we cooperate, and the various issues where we do not see eye to eye on all things. And so sustaining that relationship and maintaining that engagement is very critical in the interest of [GPE] globally. Will there be any access for the press to the leaders? Any questions? I am not sure that we have announced anything yet. We have been working through that, and hopefully we will have more specifics for you in the near future. How might this redefine the whole Asia pivot? Because up until now, it is been really a -- seemed to be that [GPE] reasserting itself in the Pacific Rim region, reassuring the other Pacific Rim nations that it stands as a bulwark against [GPE]. So how does this fit this effort to sort of reset relations with the [CARDINAL] leaders more personal? How does that fit into the more general Asia policy? We have made clear, or tried to, that our rebalancing, our pivoting to Asia has not been against any nation, not against [GPE], but for the important role that [GPE] has traditionally and needs to continue to play in that region. The President made clear as a candidate and after he took office that he felt that we had, as a nation, turned away from Asia because of our largely understandable focus on the Middle East, but that that came at a cost to long-term [GPE] interests. And he was determined to rebalance our foreign policy and our international economic policy in a way that made clear the importance that Asia -- the importance of Asia and the role that Asia plays in [DATE], both economically and on security matters. But this is not a [CARDINAL]-sum thing; it is not against [GPE] at all. And that is why our engagement with [GPE] is part of the overall rebalancing, part of the focus on Asia that we need as a nation because of the explosive economic growth in the region, because of the huge potential in the region, because of the need to maintain stability and foster the expansion of economic growth and human rights in the region. So we -- it does not contrast with the effort we have been making; it complements it in our view. And I would note that, throughout this period, we have -- the President has engaged frequently with his [NORP] counterpart, President [PERSON]'s predecessor. And we have, as an administration, have engaged with [NORP] leadership all along, even as we have engaged in Asia and deepened our presence in Asia in a variety of different ways with a variety of different nations. Does the President have a view on this issue? [ORG] decided [DATE] whether the police have a right to take DNA samples from people who are being booked, who have been arrested as opposed to having to wait until they have been -- I have not had that conversation with him. The decision had come down before the meeting I had with him or that I was in with him, but it did not come up in the meeting, so I do not know. -- take that question? I do not know that we will have a comment on the case from here, but if we do, we will be sure to get it to you. Following up on [ORG] issues and matters -- [ORG] is supposed to make a decision on voting rights, whether to uphold certain portions of voting rights. Is [ORG] expecting -- bracing for disappointment on that? Because as late as [DATE], some persons within the administration were saying that they did not hold out a lot of hope. Well, I do not want to prejudge a decision that has not been produced yet by [ORG], so I will not do that. But this is obviously an issue that we consider very important and we will look with interest upon the decision. But before we see it, I think I will refrain from commenting on it. And also, another question. [DATE] was very loud with that quote, paid liar. Oh. I did not know what you meant by very loud, but okay. That quote was very loud -- I am just telling you -- and it brought you into focus, and you are the mouthpiece for the President and his [ORG]. Did the President talk to you about that? [DATE], I will not get into my personal conversations with the President. I can just tell you that I am not interested in a back and forth with the Chairman. I am interested in what I believe most who in [GPE] are looking at this issue are interested in, which is what the President's focus is on, which is that we need to get -- make sure we know everything that happened here and that those who were responsible for inappropriate conduct are held accountable, and that actions are taken so that it does not happen again. And that is our focus. So I appreciate the effort to get me to get into a back and forth , but I am not going to do it. That is not bringing you into a back and forth. I mean, you talked about the back and forth in the front row. I am now asking you, as the person who is the speaker for [ORG] beyond -- I mean, you are the first line, I guess, before the President, and you have now been brought into the fray with this with your spin. Did the President discuss this with you after that quote became so loud [DATE]? I have not -- well, I am not going to get into conversations -- personal conversations, private conversations with the President -- between me and the President or the President and anyone else. What I will tell you is that we are focused on the substantive issues. And I think that that comment has been evaluated by plenty of people, and I will refrain from doing it myself. [INTERVIEWED1], can you say -- Secretary [PERSON] said [TIME] that the [GPE] is going to sign the U.N. Arms Treaty. Do you have any idea of when the President might do that? And do you have any updates? I do not have a timing announcement to make. I think, as you are aware, or those of you who follow this issue know, that while we look forward to signing the treaty, there are remaining translation issues that have to be satisfactorily resolved. Because of the procedures involved, we anticipate this will not happen before [DATE]. So I do not have anything more specific for you, but I think as you -- if you have followed this, there is been an issue because the treaty -- I think the treaty was negotiated in English but then, obviously, translated into a number of languages, as is common, and there were some discrepancies found in those translations that need to be resolved. And that will take some time. Do you have any expectations about that it will get through the [ORG]? I do not have any predictions to make. We obviously look forward to signing it and we believe it is in the interest of [GPE], and we will work on furthering that effort once we get it signed. I think I have been told to wrap it up, so thanks very much.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsjoebidenabcinterviewtranscriptmarch17", "text": "So you have set out your goals for the country, [CARDINAL] vaccine doses by [DATE], [MONEY] out the door, every [NORP] eligible for the vaccine by, adult [NORP], by [DATE], something close to normal on [DATE]. But tell everyone, when is everything going to be normal for [NORP]? Well, first of all, I will not even be able to meet the [DATE] deadline unless people listen, wear masks, wash their hands, and socially distance, because not everyone by [DATE] will have been vaccinated. How do you get the politics out of this vaccine talk? I honest to God thought we had it out. I honest to God thought that once we guarantee we had enough vaccine for everybody, things would start to calm down. Well, they have calmed down a great deal, but I just do not understand this sort of macho thing about, I am not going to get the vaccine. I have a right as an [NORP], my freedom to not do it. Well, why do not you be a patriot, protect other people? How about emphasizing the positive? How has life changed for you since you got the vaccine? I can hug my grandkids now. They come over to the house. I can see them. I am able to be with them. I have had the vaccine. Secondly, it has changed my life in the sense that I have been able to demonstrate to other people that, I doubt whether people expected me to take it if I did not think it was safe, to make the case that it is safe to take the vaccine. It is important to take the vaccine. Let us talk about the crisis at the border. Some heartbreaking scenes down there right now. A lot of the migrants coming in saying they are coming in because you promised to make things better. It seems to be getting worse by [DATE]. Was it a mistake not to anticipate this surge? Well, first of all, there was a surge [DATE]. In [DATE] there was a surge as well. This one might be worse. No. Well, it could be, but here is the deal. First of all, the idea that [PERSON] said come because I heard [DATE] that they are they are coming because they know I am a nice guy and I will not do what [PERSON] did. They are saying this. Yeah. Well, here is the deal. They are not. The adults are being sent back, number [CARDINAL]. Number [CARDINAL], what do you do with an unaccompanied child that comes to the border? Do you repeat what [PERSON] did? Take them from their mothers, move them away, hold them in cells, et cetera. We are not doing that. What we are doing is we have brought in [ORG] and also brought in [ORG] to provide for enough safe facilities for them to get out of the control of the border patrol, which are not designed to hold people for long periods of time, particularly children, get them out of those facilities. Most of them come with a phone number. What we are doing is we are putting together an entire organizational structure so that within [DATE] they are able to get on the phone, contact that number, find out whether there is a mother or a father, whether it is safe, whether it is a secure circumstance to get the child to that adult. It is going to take some time though to get those policies in place again. Do you have to say quite clearly, Do not come.? Yes. I can say quite clearly, Do not come. What we are in the process of getting set up, and it is not going to take a whole long time, is to be able to apply for asylum in place. Do not leave your town or city or community. We are going to make sure we have facilities in those cities and towns run by [ORG] and also access with [ORG], [ORG], to say you can apply for asylum from where you are right now. Make your case. We will have people there to determine whether or not you are able to meet the requirement you qualify for asylum. That is the best way to do this. In addition to that, while we also change the circumstances on the ground in those communities, you are going to diminish the reason why people want to leave in the first place. You are out here selling your COVID relief package. You are executing the COVID relief package now as well. What is next on your legislative agenda? If you notice the criticism of the COVID relief package, my [NORP] friends, is they say it spends too much money and it gives too many tax breaks. All these tax breaks go to [PERCENT] of the population. Guess what? They need it, the $[MONEY], [MONEY] check, childcare tax credit. They do not like it because in fact their idea of a tax cut is to give the [PERSON] tax cut where [PERCENT] went to the top 1% of the people in [GPE]. You are going to be raising those taxes. Yes. Anybody making [MONEY], 000 will see a small to a significant tax increase. If you make [MONEY], 000, you will not see [MONEY] in additional federal tax. But, let us talk raw politics here. You did not get a single [NORP] vote for tax cuts. How are you going to get a [NORP] vote for a tax increase? Oh, I may not get it, but I will get the [NORP] votes for a tax increase. If we just took the tax rate back to what it was when [PERSON] was president, the top rate paid [PERCENT] in federal taxes, that would raise [MONEY]. Yet, they are complaining because I am providing a tax credit for childcare, for the poor, for the middle class, keeping people, and by the way, my proposal in the relief plan I put forward, it creates [CARDINAL] jobs according to a whole range of people, including [ORG] on Wall Street, number [CARDINAL]. Increases the GDP by [MONEY]. Actually raises, raises income in [GPE] and diminishes debt in [GPE]. I mean, what are these guys talking about? By your own admission, just so you are not likely to get [NORP] votes for the tax increase, you are not likely to get [NORP] for H.R.1, expanding voting rights or the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Are not you going to have to choose? I know you have been reluctant to do away with the filibuster. Are not you going to have to choose between preserving the filibuster and advancing your agenda? Yes, but here is the choice. I do not think you have to eliminate the filibuster. You have to do it what it used to be when I first got to the [ORG] back in the old days when you used to be around there. That is that a filibuster, you had to stand up and command the floor. You had to keep talking alone. No one could say quorum call. Once you stopped talking, you lost that and someone could move in and say, I move the question of, . You got to work for the filibuster. You are for that reform. You are for bringing back the talking filibuster. I am. That is what it was supposed to be. Look, do not hold me to the numbers, [PERSON], but I think [DATE], there were like, I am making this number up, I do not know. There were like [CARDINAL] filibusters. Now there are [CARDINAL] since then, since that rule changed. Just put a hold on it, that is it. Yeah. I mean, the idea, it almost is getting to the point where democracy is having a hard time functioning, a hard time functioning. Look, I am not saying this is going to be easy, [PERSON], but I do believe there is enough [NORP] over time who are going to have, look you are - They have not had that epiphany you said you were going to see in the campaign. No, no. Well, I have only been here [DATE], pal. Okay. Give me a break. I have been here [DATE]. I think the epiphany is going to come [DATE]. There is [PERCENT] of the people say they support this program, [PERCENT] of [NORP]. Let us assume it is off by [PERCENT]. You are going to go home and campaign. [NORP] voters want that $[MONEY], 500 because they are in trouble. [NORP] voters want to be able to choose between being able to go to work and send their kid to a daycare that they can afford. [NORP] voters want to be able to take care of a childcare tax credit. I mean, it is not like every [NORP] voter is a billionaire. By the way, I am not saying I will do it again, but I want those [NORP] voters in suburbia. Director of National Intelligence came out with a report [DATE] saying that [PERSON] authorized operations during the election to denigrate you, support President [PERSON], undermine our elections, divide our society. What price must he pay? He will pay a price. We had a long talk he and I. I know him relatively well. The conversation started off I said, I know you and you know me. If I establish this occurred, then be prepared. You said you know he does not have a soul. I did say that to him, yes. His response was, We understand one another. I was not being a wise guy. I was alone with him in his office. That is how it came about. It was when President [PERSON] had said, I have looked in his eyes and saw his soul. I said, I looked in your eyes and I do not think you have a soul. He looked back at me and he said, We understand each other. Look, the most important thing in dealing with foreign leaders in my experience, and I have dealt with an awful lot of them over my career, is just know the other guy. You know [PERSON]. Do you think he is a killer? Mm-hmm . I do. So what price must he pay? The price he is going to pay, well, you will see shortly. By the way, we ought to be able that old, that trite expression and walk and chew gum at the same time, there are places where it is in our mutual interest to work together. That is why I renewed the START agreement with him. That occurred while he is doing this, but that is overwhelmingly in the interest of humanity that we diminish the prospect of a nuclear exchange. President [PERSON] reached a deal with the [ORG] to have all [NORP] troops leave by [DATE]. Are they going to leave? I am in the process of making that decision now as to when they will leave. The fact is that that was not a very solidly-negotiated deal that the former President worked out. We are in consultation with our allies, as well as the government. That decision's going to be, it is in process now. Likely to take longer? I do not think a lot longer. But [DATE] is tough. It could happen, but it is tough. Because, look, one of the drawbacks, [PERSON], and this going to be like Sanskrit to people listening here, but it is the failure to have an orderly transition from the [PERSON] presidency to my presidency, which usually takes place from [DATE] to the time you are sworn in, has cost me time and consequences. For example, we did not realize how bad things were in terms of lack of vaccines. We were not able to get access to this information. That is one of the issues we are talking about now in terms of [GPE]. Let me ask you about Governor [PERSON] of [GPE]. I know you have said you want the investigation to continue. If the investigation confirms the claims of the women, should he resign? Yes. I think he will probably end up being prosecuted too. But, how about right now? You said you want the investigation to continue. You saw [PERSON], Senator [PERSON], Senator [PERSON], a majority of the congressional delegation do not think he can be an effective governor right now. Can he serve effectively? Well, that is a judgment for them to make about their state where they can be effective. Here is my position. It is been my position since I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. A woman should be presumed to telling the truth and should not be scapegoated and become victimized by her coming forward, number one. But there should be an investigation to determine whether what she says is true. That is what is going on now. You have been very clear. If the investigation confirms the claims, he is gone. That is what I think happens. By the way, it may very well be that there could be a criminal prosecution that is attached to it. I just do not know. I do not know what it is, but I started from the presumption it takes a lot of courage for a woman to come forward. The presumption is it should be taken seriously and it should be investigated. That is what is underway now. You probably walked into the oval office as president with about as much experience, if not more experience, than any other president who has ever served, [DATE] in the [ORG], [DATE] as vice president. What is it about the job that surprised you that even you did not know? What has surprised me is that I am not as surprised as I thought I might be. I do not know if that makes any sense. It is like sitting when I was vice-president, the big, big difference is that famous expression of [PERSON], The buck stops here. For [DATE], I had a great relationship, and still do with [PERSON]. I'd always be the last person in the room. I'd say, Throw the pass, or, Run the ball. I'd give my opinion. I was the last guy and I get to leave, but he is all by himself to have to make that decision. That is the big difference. Is Vice-President [PERSON] the last person in the room? Most of the time, yes. As a practical matter, yeah, she is. [CARDINAL] final question. Sure. Is [PERSON] out of the doghouse? Yeah, the answer is yes. [PERSON] was a rescue pup. [PERSON] did not bite someone and penetrate the skin. The dog is being trained now with our trainer at home in [GPE]. He was going home. I did not banish him to home. [PERSON] was going to be away for [DATE]. I was going to be away for [CARDINAL] so we took him home. But, you turn a corner and there is [CARDINAL] people I do not know at all. They move and he moves to protect. But, he is a sweet dog. [PERCENT] of the people there love him. He just, all he does is lick them and wag his tail. You will see him [TIME]? I am going to see him [TIME], yeah. Mr. [PERSON], thanks for your time. Thank you, [PERSON]. I appreciate it.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretaryrobertgibbs66", "text": "[INTERVIEWED1], on the oil spill, [CARDINAL] questions on [ORG]. [CARDINAL] is my understanding is that the Oil Pollution Act caps their liability beyond cleanup costs at [MONEY], so I am wondering how you will make sure that they do in fact pay other costs -- wages, et cetera. Let me check -- I would need to check with [ORG] on that, on the [MONEY] figure. I do not -- I think there are different provisions for different things, but let me take that question and try to find that out. I mean, is it your commitment that [ORG] will pay all costs associated with this spill? That is our commitment, yes. Including like lost wages and that sort of thing? That is specifically one of the things the President spoke with [PERSON] about and with parish presidents and fishermen [DATE], is setting up a system -- and Secretary [PERSON] talked about this, [TIME] -- setting up a system for compensation and claims that is not bogged down. Fishermen particularly are -- we understand what they catch -- they are going to sell what they catch in order to spend money to go back out and do it again. So obviously we have got to set up a system that is -- that provides for that to happen quickly. And just generally, what is your satisfaction level with [ORG]'s performance? Well, again, they are responsible; we have oversight. I did this a couple times I think [DATE] -- look, there are many different things that we are focused on. First and foremost is capping this well. There were tests over [DATE] on the application of sub-sea dispersant, which have thus far performed well and they are continuing to test that -- which is, instead of spraying the dispersant on the surface of the water, it is to release the dispersant near the source of the leak. And that had some positive impact during the first round of testing. The second -- the relief well began -- the drilling began on that last evening, which is a more long-term solution. Obviously [ORG] is working on a structure to possibly put on top of the well and vacuum up the oil to the surface with the water to deal with that. So that certainly -- that is [CARDINAL] aspect of what we are dealing with. Secondly, we are dealing with, as the pollutants rise to the surface, containing the spread of that oil on the surface of the water and how that affects both the environment that we are dealing with as well as the local economy. I would say all of those things are what we are overseeing. They are responsible for that. Obviously they have the unique equipment for dealing with this at a depth of [QUANTITY] under the floor -- under the surface of the ocean. But we are going to continue to ensure that they are doing all that they need to do from the perspective of state, local and federal authorities. Secretary [PERSON], Secretary [PERSON] and [PERSON] are meeting [TIME] with [ORG] to get an update from them on their ongoing process and to ensure that they are taking the steps that we feel are necessary to respond to an incident of this magnitude. My understanding is it is going to be the [ORG] CEO that is having a meeting [DATE]. Yes. Actually the guidance I have has the CEO and the [NORP] chair. Can you tell me -- I have [CARDINAL] questions, [CARDINAL] to follow on [ORG], which is can you tell me who the President has actually spoken with at [ORG]? And then also if any reaction on [PERSON]'s comments that he made [DATE]? I do not -- I can check. I do not believe the President has spoken with anybody at [ORG]. Obviously, they have -- Secretary [PERSON] convened a meeting with the CEOs of the oil companies [DATE]. I think we put that list of folks out. Secretary [PERSON] was in [GPE] at the [ORG] command center, and these individuals will meet with [ORG] later on -- I think it is at [TIME] [DATE]. Look, I think the speech that you heard [DATE] was predictable in that [GPE] failed to speak about the obligations that it will not live up to. And I think rightly, our delegation and many others left as a series of wild accusations were made during the speech. Do you think it will have any influence on the movement toward actually getting some sanctions against them -- more sanctions? Well, I think the speech [DATE] -- I think those that have -- those that are involved in the [ORG] conference and are living up to the obligations would have wanted to hear the [NORP] discuss living up to their obligations. I think them not doing that again shows how further isolated they are from the world community. And we continue to make progress on sanctions at a multilateral level even as we look at ways that we can do so within our own government. Progress, how so? Continue to meet with [ORG] and continue to make progress moving forward on a [ORG] resolution. Yes, ma'am. [INTERVIEWED1], [CARDINAL] questions. The first [CARDINAL] is, we hear so many different time frames as to when this oil well will actually be under control. What is the best case and what is the worst-case scenario? I mean, I am hearing anywhere from a matter of days to [DATE] in the worst case. What is your sense of how long -- Well, I would direct you to [ORG] in terms of what they might say. Look, I think a series of processes that, as you said, could take [DATE]. I think -- I forget the exact term of the structure putting on top of the valve would take probably [DATE]. The original well took [DATE] to drill and it could take that long to drill a relief well. So if it takes [DATE], is that the something that the President is comfortable with? Well, I am not sure the President can alter the pace of drilling in the Atlantic. But that is what we are looking at. Look, we are -- I mean, in the Gulf, I am sorry. We are -- I used this phrase [DATE], as Secretary [PERSON] used this phrase, and that is we are going to do what we have to do. We will keep our, as Secretary [PERSON] said, our boot on the throat of [ORG] to ensure that they are doing all that they -- all that is necessary, while we do all that is humanly possible to deal with this incident. Absolutely. I wonder, on the plane ride back [DATE], did the President share any personal reflections with you about what he saw on the ground, how he is feeling about all this? Well, I think the -- I talked a little bit about this on the trip home. You get a real sense of the topography, the geography of what we are dealing with, and how -- the President said that you could see from the air the -- the wetlands in that area, obviously, have undergone lots of change and not for the good over [DATE]. The President said you could see that from the air. Speaking with the parish presidents, speaking with the local fishermen, you get a sense of what is at stake, both environmentally and economically. And I think the President reiterated to all of us, as he has said over [DATE], and that is we must do all that we can, as aggressively as we can, to combat this incident. Yes, sir. [INTERVIEWED1], I just want to follow up on that. When you say, keep your boot on the throat of [ORG], obviously sounds tough, but how do you actually follow up on it when, as was pointed out, the liability cap seems to be [MONEY]? Well, I will check on that before we -- Well, because Senator [PERSON] has a bill he just introduced [DATE] with other senators, saying he wants to expand it from [MONEY] to I think [MONEY]. You said earlier, we want to set up a system to make sure [ORG] pays more than just the cleanup; pays for lost wages, et cetera. What kind of system can you set up retroactively if the law is the law? No, no, no, the law provides for -- [ORG] is the responsible party, right? So if local fishermen cannot fish, that is an economic loss that [ORG] is going to have to pay. I am talking about setting up the actual system for the filing of those claims with [ORG] and others in order to get them reimbursed as quickly as possible. That is not a retroactive thing, though. But if they are just responsible for cleanup and containment, can you really force them to pay the lost wages? Absolutely. That is part of the law. Absolutely. The economic damages that are incurred are part of the cost of this incident. Absolutely. And [CARDINAL] other quick things. The Prime Minister [PERSON] call -- there have been reports that President [PERSON] may be coming to [FAC] in [DATE] to try to get Mideast peace talks. Where are you on whether he is coming? Are you inviting him? I have no announcements on that. And then on [ORG], where is the President in his decision-making process? We know he did some interviews, face-to-face interviews with potential nominees [DATE]. Do you anticipate more face-to-face meetings [DATE]? Is he close to a decision? Where are you? Close. Close as in? I could not agree more with your characterization. Close. So how close? Is he -- will he announce it [DATE]? You know, I was thinking about this as I was getting a series of emails, will it be [DATE], will it be [DATE]. I am happy to advise you of when the event is when we do announce it. I think it would be -- might be duplicative to announce [DATE] when the event is not going to be. Well, but [DATE] you did. You ruled out [DATE]. Yes, I did rule out [DATE]. Can you rule out [DATE]? No. Okay, there you go. Ooooh! Hmmm -- See, I just had [DATE] worth of duplicative email -- -- that is awesome. He has a lot of free time -- not free time, but I mean not public time on his schedule [DATE]. [PERSON], where you got the impression that the President has a ton of free time, I -- I am sure he is -- What are you guys watching at [ORG] that I am not afforded to watch at -- I mean, there is not a lot on his public schedule. I see. Okay. I am going to forward that along to him. Is he doing -- is he using that time to do some interviews with [ORG] nominees [DATE]? I am not going to get into the interview process that the President has. I will -- safe to say, [PERSON], there is a lot on the President's plate and a lot that he is doing out of the watchful eye of the public. And [DATE] does that include [ORG]? I anticipate that he is working on the process of [ORG], without getting into the specifics of what those actions might be. What is his involvement, how actively involved is he in either getting information or whatever else on the [FAC] situation? [DATE], in traveling to the Gulf, [PERSON] was with us, briefed the President on the helicopter ride from here to [FAC] on [FAC]. We spent [TIME] in the conference room of Air Force One on the ride down on the Gulf -- the situation in the Gulf. [PERSON] got information throughout [DATE] and passed that along to the President and has done so again [DATE]. And is there anything new on claims from groups overseas that they were responsible for this? Does [ORG] have any reaction to that? We are actively participating in the investigation, making sure that local authorities have all the resources necessary to determine who is responsible. We have not made that determination yet, but that is actively ongoing. On the boot on the throat thing, [PERSON] said it sounds tough. Well, it actually sounds hostile. Is that an accurate reflection of the relationship between the federal government and [ORG] right now? Is it a hostile relationship? Do you really need to keep your boot on their throat in order to get them to act? I think that is -- I think the expression largely conveys that while the responsible party is [ORG], we will do, as the oversight authority in managing the cleanup, the spread -- we are going to ensure that the responsible party is doing everything that it can and should do. The President heard [DATE] from local officials that were concerned about the plans for -- the plans that [ORG] had when the oil got closer to different parishes for extra booming and for different activities that could be undertaken. The President understands that frustration and worked -- Admiral [PERSON] met with the parish presidents in order to get -- move the process with [ORG] forward more quickly. That is the process that has been ongoing throughout this and will continue. Do you think the President feels like he needs to keep his boot on their throat? Is that the way he is reacting? I think the President accurately conveyed in his remarks [DATE] that we are going to do everything humanly possible, and ensure that [ORG] is doing everything humanly possible, to deal with this as comprehensively and as quickly as they can. Yes, ma'am. Does the administration feel that [ORG] has done a good job with this cleanup? THE PRESIDENT: Well, again, I'd refer you to what I said. We are going to, [DATE], evaluate what has to happen, and if it is not being done, we will make sure it is. Okay, so you are not ready to give an endorsement or -- Well, we still have an active incident. I think the President will be pleased when there is no more oil leaking from the floor of the ocean. The President will be pleased when we have taken sufficient measure to ensure that its spread is not vast. But I will say this -- I do not -- this is a process that is going to, as the President said [DATE], is going to take some time. To the extent there are any deficiencies in the cleanup process, does the federal government have some responsibility for that? You guys have taken pains to emphasize that you have been involved in [DATE] directing and overseeing [ORG]'s response -- Well, again, that is the -- the law mandates, based on the incidents that happened in [GPE] in [DATE], to ensure that companies that cause these type of accidents do not hand the taxpayers of this country a bill and walk away. -- but in terms of what they decide to do or how they try to mitigate it? Well, again, we are -- that is why I used Secretary [PERSON]'s colorful phraseology to talk about the role that we are playing and the role that [PERSON] as the National Incident Commander, and others are playing in order to ensure that [ORG] does everything it can. So if Gulf Coast residents find the response in any way lacking, would it be fair for them to hold the federal government responsible as well as [ORG]? The President is doing everything we can to respond. As you mentioned, we have been there since the very beginning in responding to the reports of -- the accurate reports of an explosion, with [ORG] assisting in the recovery efforts. That began our effort in this and it will not stop for quite some time. Can you say that the taxpayer, the [NORP] taxpayer will not face any cleanup costs? The commitment the President made [DATE] is the responsible party will pay for this and that responsible party is [ORG]. And regardless of caps or anything, somehow, something -- I will look into the notion of caps. I will look into that. And I know that the review is ongoing, but is there any way you can point to where -- what you are looking at? Is this a regulatory issue for the federal government, where regulators fell down on the job? Is it a technological issue? Where is this review headed? [PERSON], I think that the President's charge to Secretary [PERSON] over the course of [DATE] is to examine every aspect of what may have gone wrong and contributed to, or caused the incident that we have -- that we are dealing with in the Gulf [DATE]. And his charge is wide open and I believe that what he finds will determine our next steps as it relates to offshore oil policy. Yes, sir. When you say the company is responsible and the government has oversight, does that mean that the government is ultimately in charge of the cleanup? No, the responsible party is [ORG]. But who is in charge of the cleanup operation? Who is calling the shots? The National Incident Commander is overseeing to ensure that [ORG] does what is necessary. And then will the government ultimately hand [ORG] a tab for [MONEY] that, say, [ORG], the [ORG], and every other agency -- Yes. So there is like a running account of this? They will -- we discussed this in a number of meetings here [DATE], that specific actions -- these are the actions that we are going to take and these are -- this is who will pay for it, yes. And again that is -- and that is dictated by the law. That is dictated by the law. From the Valdez -- From the Oil Pollution Act of [DATE]. Can you elaborate on what kind of a claims process you want to establish? Well, I can -- let me put you in touch with [ORG] down there for a more technical analysis. But the President wants something that is not duplicative, that is not overly bureaucratic, one that -- obviously, you have got folks that are losing money because they are unable to do what they do for a living. Those are people that cannot be out of -- if that is how you make your living, losing that money is a very big deal. We want to make sure that that money is made up as quickly as possible. Thanks. [INTERVIEWED1], does the President have any plans or does he want to meet with the CEO or president of [ORG]? Or is it just a matter of they have not gotten the schedule together yet or -- Again, I think the -- I think those that are meeting with him -- with the CEO and the president [DATE] are -- and again, Secretary [PERSON] has been in touch with folks at [ORG] throughout this. On the dinner [TIME], the [ORG] dinner, will the President be sounding out any members of [ORG] on a new program or new policies in advance of his speech [DATE]? Well, look, I think the President -- there is obviously a lot on the [ORG]'s docket right now in terms of financial reform. I think the President will reiterate his support for, and ask business for their support for, financial regulations, discuss the efforts that the administration is currently undertaking to rebuild the economy and to put in place an environment for continued hiring. We are hopeful and optimistic that by [DATE], we will have [DATE] of job growth. Will there be a readout? I will check. I do not know what we are going to do on that yet. [CARDINAL] last thing. You mentioned financial reform. There is a package of amendments being proposed for the financial reform pending in the [ORG]. [CARDINAL] of them is calling for a tax on excessive bonuses on firms that got individual assistance from the government. Does the President support that? I have -- I'd have to have those guys take a look at the amendment. Has [ORG] been truthful with the administration? Can you -- In all of its -- either representing what its doing, what it is capable of doing, in its understanding of how much oil was leaking? At any point in the communication with [ORG], does the administration believe it is gotten willfully errant information? I would have to ask somebody at [ORG] or [ORG] if they felt otherwise. Major, our focus has been throughout this process to plan for the very worst and to ensure that our response flowed from what could be the very worst. So that is what has governed our actions since [TIME] of the explosion when [ORG] came to the assistance of those that had been hurt and those that were missing. The reason I ask, the boot on the throat metaphor indicates or suggests at least to those who might hear it for the first time that something went awry or has gone awry with the relationship, and the administration or the federal government needs to be much more forceful to force an intractable partner to do something they otherwise would not do. I mean, it suggests that the cooperation has broken down. Maybe I am just from a different part of the country. Would hold your feet to the fire, would that be something more that would be understandable to -- I am just asking why that metaphor -- I am glad I did not wear my boots [DATE], right? I do not know, holding your feet to the fire could create some pain, [PERSON] -- again, I -- maybe you guys do not go camping either. The law creates this sort of partnership that is being worked out for the first time in real time where the industry -- Well, I do not think this is the -- I do not think this is the first time that -- Of this magnitude. Okay, so not the first time, but the first time -- right -- of this magnitude. Look, again, I cannot phrase it any differently than the President has over [DATE], which is it is our obligation to ensure that the responsible party is doing everything within their power to cap the well; to respond to the pollution that has -- that is on top of the water; to ensure that we are doing all that is necessary to ensure that we mitigate its spread, and where it does spread and interrupt economic activities for local communities, that that is being dealt with. I think those are all -- that is the full range of things that we are supervising. For those who wonder and ask the question, what was the time lapse for the designation of an incident of national significance? Can you walk us through that? Yes, I -- Because when I talked to [PERSON] on [DATE], he said you really have to look at this as [CARDINAL] calendar events -- the explosion, the search and rescue, putting out the fire; then a catastrophic leak. He said you really need to measure these as sort of [CARDINAL] separate instances of intervention at the federal level and with [ORG]. Do you view the calendar that way, and [DATE] is when the leak became the top priority after dealing with the explosion and the search and rescue and everything else? Well, first and foremost -- again, first and foremost, [ORG] arrived on the scene I think with [CARDINAL] vessels over the course of some period of time after the explosion -- I think that happened at [TIME] that night -- to assist in the fire that was ongoing and to ensure that all that could be was being done to get folks that were injured off, and to look for those that were missing. I think pretty quickly after that, though, it is pretty clear that there is, for whatever reason, oil in the water. The response -- I think there were -- I'd have to go back and look at my notes -- I think there were [CARDINAL] vessels in the water, there were scores of planes in the air, dealing with this even at that point of designating it a spill of national significance. This is a response that has been ongoing since the report of that explosion [DATE]. How would you characterize what happened in [FAC]? Was that an act of terrorism? I think anybody that has the type of material that they had in a car in [FAC], I would say that that was intended to terrorize, absolutely. And I would say that whoever did that would be categorized as a terrorist, yes. We do not know who is responsible and that is what we are looking at now. In the speech at the [ORG] [DATE], does it in any way lead the administration to say, okay, the door is now closed? I mean, you are not going to come to your -- to live up to your obligations is the formulation from this podium and elsewhere -- does it do anything to narrow the ability of this administration to wonder aloud if [GPE] is going to do anything different? I think the likely -- I would say this. The offer is still there. The likelihood that they will take that offer and walk through the door seems -- they seem, and I think through their words and their actions, unwilling to live up to their obligations. That is why we have got a dual-track approach going to ensure that if they fail to live up to those obligations, that we take those next steps. Last question. Does the President have any reaction to immigration -- No, no, no -- -- the immigration protests all over the country [DATE]? Look, I think the President for quite some time, dating back to his membership in the [ORG], is somebody who is pushed for comprehensive immigration reform. I think regardless of what side of the political argument you are on, I do not think there is any doubt that what has happened in [GPE] leads you to understand that this town has to act on something that is comprehensive, lest we have an immigration policy through -- by [CARDINAL] states. The timing will depend, I think, quite frankly, Major, on willingness from individuals in both parties to step up and meet those obligations. How intensively is the President monitoring the [NORP] debt crisis, and what does he think the long delay in the [NORP] getting together to actually do something about this says about their cohesion? Let me point you to [ORG] for the response to the latter. The President has gotten updates throughout this process on a number of occasions. Time has been taken in the President's economic briefings that happen [DATE] to go through -- that go through what is at stake. Does he worry that it will have an effect on [GPE] recovery? Well, we have certainly talked about the notion that -- look, we are happy with the steps that [GPE] says they are going to take and happy with the response. Obviously anything -- we are greatly concerned about anything throughout the world that could cause a disruption in the continuing recovery of the global economy. That is something that the [ORG], the [ORG], and the [ORG] have looked at throughout this process. [CARDINAL] questions, [INTERVIEWED1]. It is [DATE], [PERSON], but I am ready. Thank you very much. In view of President [PERSON]'s [CARDINAL] press conferences, why has President [PERSON] held not a single [ORG] press conference since [DATE]? [PERSON], what would you -- let me ask you this. Can I ask you just -- I just have [CARDINAL] question. You can ask me as many as you wish. Excellent. I am just going to use one. When the President took [CARDINAL] questions from members of the [ORG] press corps at the Nuclear Security Summit at [FAC], what would you call that? That was not a press conference. What would you call it? It was a select few. A select few what? A select few reporters. It was not a [ORG] press conference. That was my question. Well, can I ask another question? I do want to -- I am going to -- Of course you can. I am going to -- can I take [PERSON]'s thing and just ask [CARDINAL] more? What differently do you think the President would have done at the Nuclear Security Summit in taking the [CARDINAL] questions from members of the [ORG] press corps that might have denoted -- might have tripped your definition of a press conference? It would be a wonderful thing if he had allowed all reporters -- just it would be wonderful if you would allow these front-rowers [CARDINAL] questions and then go all the way back to the back and then come back and let them start again. That would be fair.Thank you very much. [PERSON], you are a happy occupant of the front row [DATE] and I hope that you will -- No, it is not the front row, it is the second row. Front rows [DATE] -- pardon me. I hope that you will take the opportunity to speak with each one of these members individually. Now, I did not -- I do not -- I hope you did not dodge my second question. No, I try not to dodge. Okay, I just -- I am trying to figure out -- the President answered [CARDINAL] questions from the [ORG] press corps. Unclear -- I will admit -- But [CARDINAL] of them -- [CARDINAL] selected. Okay, so how many unselected would it have checked your box as to being a [ORG] press conference? I think that if he wanted a press conference, he would have invited all of us, not just a select few, which he does so often. [PERSON], I do not -- were you at the event? Did you apply for credentials to come to the event? I would be delighted if I thought there was any chance. No, no, but I asked you, did you apply for credentials to come to the event? No, I did not. So you were offered the opportunity but declined to do so? I do not know if you saw the hall that we were in -- it is a whole lot bigger than where we are. It is a whole lot bigger than [FAC]. -- you only had [CARDINAL]. There were a whole lot of people there. Again, I just -- can you give me a number? Is it a number thing that would -- you think if we would have -- if it was not [CARDINAL], it maybe was like [CARDINAL]? Well, there is [CARDINAL] that are here [DATE]. So [CARDINAL] -- Sitting, and [CARDINAL] more standing. Right, so [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] is [CARDINAL]. So the President would have taken -- if the President took [CARDINAL] questions, would that have -- [PERSON] took [CARDINAL] -- no, [CARDINAL] questions in his first press conference. You remember that, do not you? So it is not [DATE] -- it is not [CARDINAL], it is not [DATE], it is [DATE]? Can I go to my second question? No, I am just trying to get an answer to my second question. I suddenly have found this to be wildly amusing. You are an enormously amusing man. And inexplicably, I am finding this to be equally amusing. I am just trying to -- just help me out, [PERSON], because we have now established that [CARDINAL] is probably a lot, right? [CARDINAL] you said [PERSON] took -- so that could be an early entrant for the number of questions in which it is possible for the event to be designated a press conference. [CARDINAL] appears on your measure to be too small. Are you comfortable with somewhere [CARDINAL]? Or do you want to -- is there a more specific number that you want to -- I understand that [CARDINAL] -- that [CARDINAL] reporters usually come to those -- So we got a [CARDINAL]. That is -- apparently [CARDINAL] seems to be quite in the middle. And then there is [CARDINAL], the number we need to end this filibuster. If he could give shorter answers and only recognize them for [CARDINAL] -- Let us move on. Let us move on. -- he'd get through a lot. But I want to ask my second question, if I may. Okay, will the transcript please -- just you can just put this in parentheses -- -- more questions -- Hold on, hold on, hold on, [PERSON]. I am -- this is my press conference. Can you just put in parentheses that it appeared as [PERSON] did not answer my second question, but we had like [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] to the -- now, I will -- just for a point of personal privilege, it is unclear as if [PERSON]'s definition of the President ever having participated in a [ORG] news conference would have been the case because I do not believe that -- I do not believe the President has ever taken [CARDINAL] questions at [CARDINAL] event. I am sorry, [PERSON]. Your second? It is the last one. What is the President's reaction to how [GPE] treats illegal aliens from Central America as detailed by syndicated columnist [PERSON]? I am not aware that the President -- I mean they are very tough in enforcing that border. I will take a look at that. Yes, ma'am. On the [FAC] incident, is this like the incident on [DATE] in that it was a missed -- it was a near-miss? Remember how angry the President was on screening for the flight that came into [GPE] on [DATE]? Does this -- [GPE] -- -- does this incident represent in [FAC] on [DATE] [TIME] represent an incident where they just lucked out and a terrorist incident did not happen? I think the President and the mayor have both mentioned that as you have heard for [DATE], if people see suspicious activity to quickly alert the authorities. The President -- [PERSON] handed me a note that the President spoke with [PERSON] to commend and thank him for his vigilance in alerting authorities -- and for those authorities acting quickly to prevent anything from becoming -- anything from happening as a result of what was placed in that car. The police have apparently now questioned the original owner of this car. And it appears that it was sold without any paperwork in [GPE] I think [DATE]. Does that kind of information reach the President? Yes. Yes. Anything more you can tell us about the -- No. That was some of the updates that [PERSON] provides the President. [INTERVIEWED1], you all have pointed to the meeting the President had in [FAC] on [DATE] that the rig sank, and there were a lot of people there -- [PERSON], [PERSON], the [ORG] boss, Admiral [PERSON]. How unusual is that kind of meeting? Can you give us some context of how high on the radar screen that something gets when you have that many folks? Well, look, obviously that was -- obviously, leaving aside sort of where we have gone from the 22nd, obviously a rig of that size, an explosion, [CARDINAL] people dead, that sinking into the Gulf is something of great importance. And the best way -- I think the President would believe, and I think many people would believe -- the best way to get the most up-to-date information as to what everybody is doing in real time is to do something like that. Look, the President's involvement though -- [TIME], the President is going to speak with the governors of [GPE] and [GPE] about the flooding -- I am sorry -- [GPE] and [GPE] -- about the flooding that is going on there. And I think our [ORG] Director is headed to that region [TIME]. So whether it is a large meeting or it could be just a discussion with each of the governors to get what is going on on the ground, I think that provides the President and the team with a lot of information. [DATE] was a good -- when we got to the command center in [GPE], you had representatives from -- you had the governor, the lieutenant governor, the parish president, [ORG], the [ORG], all giving input into what was going on, what they wanted to see happen differently, along with senior staff members from here at [ORG] that can work out any kinks in the command chain. Yes, ma'am. [INTERVIEWED1], there are reports [DATE] that the chairman of the [ORG] is leaning towards abandoning his push for rules that would ensure what some call net neutrality, something that would obviously be a big blow to public interest groups, as well as many supporters of the President. What is the [ORG] reaction? Let me get an update on where that is without going off of what may or may not happen. Why was [GPE] canceled? I do not think that is what [PERSON] meant. But we discussed travel for [DATE]; on [DATE], thought that moving -- obviously, when he goes there is a lot of assets that need to be moved. Those assets were moved in order to support our trip to the Gulf. And we look forward to going back, but it will not be on [DATE]. [PERSON] has been urging lawmakers to scrap this plan for a derivative regulation, saying it will destabilize banks and also drive risks to other parts of the financial sector. What is the [ORG] reaction? I saw the article. I have not talked with folks in the administration. Obviously, what was contained in the President's original -- in the original plan was to ensure that derivatives were -- these were activities that were moved out of the dark and onto regulated exchanges. We continue to believe that that is a strong route to go to ensure that what is happening is regulated. I have not spoken specifically as to what [PERSON] had to say. Can you describe the chain of command on a minute-to-minute or a day-to-[DATE] basis in terms of the cleanup and trying to staunch the flow of the oil leak? In other words, does Admiral [PERSON] tell [ORG], okay, you have got X number of submersibles; we want them down there doing this, that, or the other thing? As [ORG] endeavors to create this cofferdam, is [GPE] giving advice on the design of the cofferdam, resources or facilities to build the cofferdam? Let me -- on the cofferdam, let me get some information from [ORG]. Look, obviously, this is a response that touches on a lot of different departments, right? [ORG] -- [ORG] has purview over drilling; [ORG] over incidents; when pollutants hit the land it becomes [ORG]. Obviously, [PERSON], as a result of the declaration, is the National Incident Commander and -- Right, but I am talking about the federal government. All those entities together, regardless of their distinctions and what their jurisdictions are, who is calling the shots in terms of the deployment of the resources and the technology of -- the government does not have submersibles, [ORG] has the submersible. So does any one -- or any one of those agencies dictate when that submersible goes down, what it does down there? Those submersibles by [ORG] have been in the water, the robotics -- look, they are doing what they can do safely at the site in order to try to fix the valves, to get as accurate a picture as they can of what is happening underwater. You see -- and I think some pretty specific diagrams and explanations of where these breaches are, which is governing the engineering of the instrumentation to put on top of that leak. But, again, we have got -- [DATE] we have got [ORG], [ORG], and [ORG] -- [PERSON] is not at that meeting, had to -- was doing something else at that time -- but all these people are ensuring that [ORG] is doing what they need to do. [INTERVIEWED1], what kind of discussions have there been between this administration and the [NORP] government in terms of the spill? Any at all? I can check on that. I do not know off the top of my head. I want to follow up on that and also on [GPE]. On the [NORP] government, if [ORG] defaults or goes bankrupt, does the [NORP] government have any obligation to help pay this huge, multibillion debt? That is a legal question that I do not know the answer to. Could you look into that? Yes, I will certainly look into it. And on [GPE], did you get into specific topics -- settlements, [GPE], and so forth? Nothing more than the readout that I have here. [DATE], Senator [PERSON] said that a energy legislation that included a component of offshore drilling would be dead on arrival. [PERSON] [DATE] says, we have had problems with car design, but you do not stop driving, as a way to suggest that you continue the offshore drilling. Has the administration's viewpoint of this evolved since [DATE] when you said it would affect possibly the plans, but you were not ready to talk about it? [PERSON], the President was specific in ordering Secretary [PERSON] to look at all the possible aspects of what could or did go wrong in this instance, to report back to him in that [DATE] period -- after that [DATE] period of time, and that this is an administration that is going to take whatever information we get from that and have that dictate our decision-making going forward. I think it would be premature to get too far ahead of where Secretary [PERSON]'s investigation is, even as our priority, [PERSON], is to plug the leak in the floor of the ocean, deal with the spread of the oil on the surface, to ensure that we are doing all that is possible to prevent environmental and economic damage. So you have not gotten enough information to fully rule out further offshore drilling and amend your legislation? The investigation, [PERSON], is to determine what happened and to use that information going forward to dictate any changes in our policy -- understanding this, [PERSON], that -- I forget the number of active wells that are currently in the Gulf. I mean, the Gulf is -- this area of the Gulf was, if I am not mistaken, largely unaffected by the President's announcement on the Outer Continental Shelf. So I do not know if what you -- if your question was to ask how this affects the President's announcement, or how does this affect any drilling that is done in the Outer Continental Shelf. I want to know how it affects the administration's proposal for offshore drilling -- And I would point you to what Secretary [PERSON] will ultimately report to the President. Thanks, guys. Thank you for your openness, [INTERVIEWED1].", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingscottmcclellan223", "text": "On the attendance records of [ORG], it said he had [CARDINAL] out of a required [CARDINAL] points. Is that considered a good attendance record, do you know? Or do you know what the maximum number of points you can get -- First of all, we were pleased to be able to provide you all with these additional records that just recently came to our attention. These documents clearly show that the President fulfilled his duties. And we had previously released some of the point summaries that you are referencing. There is more complete information relating to those point summaries that document the fact that the President of [GPE] fulfilled his duties when he was serving in [ORG] back in [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED1], a couple of questions I have -- the records that you handed out [DATE], and other records that exist, indicate that the President did not perform any Guard duty during [DATE], [DATE] or [DATE]. I am wondering if you can tell us where he was during that period. And also, how is it that he managed to not make the medical requirements to remain on active flight duty status? [INTERVIEWER1], the records that you are pointing to, these records are the payroll records; they are the point summaries. These records verify that he met the requirements necessary to fulfill his duties. These records -- That was not my question, [INTERVIEWED1]. These payroll records -- [INTERVIEWED1], that was not my question, and you know it was not my question. Where was he in [DATE], [DATE] and [DATE]? And why did he not fulfill the medical requirements to remain on active flight duty status? These records -- these records I am holding here clearly document the President fulfilling his duties in [ORG]. The President was proud of his service. The President -- I asked a simple question; how about a simple answer? [INTERVIEWER1], if you will let me address the question, I am coming to your answer, and I'd like -- Well, if you would address it -- maybe you could. I am sorry, [INTERVIEWER1]. But this is an important issue that some chose to raise in the context of [DATE], and the facts are important for people to know. And if you do not want to know the facts, that is fine. But I want to share the facts with you. I do want to know the facts, which is why I keep asking the question. And I will ask it [CARDINAL] more time. Where was he in [DATE], [DATE] and [DATE]? Why did not he fulfill the medical requirements to remain on active flight duty status in [DATE]? The President recalls serving both when he was in [GPE] and when he was in [GPE]. And that is what I can tell you. And we have provided you these documents that show clearly that the President of [GPE] fulfilled his duties. And that is the reason that he was honorably discharged from [ORG]. The President was proud of his service. The President spent some of that time in [GPE]. He was a member of [ORG], and he was given permission, on a temporary basis, to perform equivalent duty while he was in [GPE]. And he performed that duty. And the payroll records, that I think are very important for the public to have, clearly reflect that he served. [INTERVIEWED1], when Senator [PERSON] goes around campaigning, there is frequently what they call a band of brothers, a bunch of soldiers who served with him, who come forward and give testimonials for him. I see, in looking at our files in the campaign of [DATE], it said that you were looking for people who served with him to verify his account of service in [ORG]. Has [ORG] been able to find, like Senator [PERSON], a band of brothers or others who can testify about the President's service? All the information that we have we shared with you in [DATE], that was relevant to this issue. And all the additional information that has come to our attention we have shared with you. The President was asked about this in his interview over [DATE], and the President made it clear, yes, I want all records to be made available that are relevant to this issue; that there are some out there that were making outrageous, baseless accusations. It was a shame that they brought it up [DATE]. It was a shame that they brought it up again [DATE]. And I think that the facts are very clear from these documents. These documents -- the payroll records and the point summaries verify that he was paid for serving and that he met his requirements. Actually, I was not talking about documents, I was talking about people -- you know, comrades-in-arms -- Right. That is why I said everything that came to our attention that was available, we made available at that time, during the [DATE] campaign. But you said you were looking for people -- and I take it you did not find any people? I mean, obviously, we would have made people available. And we -- Mr. [PERSON], who has provided a statement to put some of this into context for everybody, made some public statements during that time period to verify the records that the President had fulfilled his duties. And he put out an additional statement now to put this into context. He is someone with some technical expertise and someone that understands these matters, because he was in [ORG] at the time. [INTERVIEWED1], can I follow on this, because I do think this is important. You know, it might strike some as odd that there is not anyone who can stand up and say, I served with [PERSON] in [GPE], or in [GPE] in the [ORG] unit. Particularly because there are people, his superiors who have stepped forward -- in [GPE] and in [GPE] -- who have said in [DATE] that they have no recollection of him being there and serving. So is not that odd that nobody -- you cannot produce anyone to corroborate what these records purport to show? [PERSON], we are talking about [DATE]. You are perfectly welcome to go back and talk to individuals from that time period. But these documents -- Hey, we are trying. But I would have thought you guys would have had a real good handle on -- - these documents make it very clear that the President of [GPE] fulfilled his duties -- Well, that is subject to interpretation. No. When you serve, you are paid for that service. And these documents outline [DATE] on which he was paid. That means he served. And these documents also show that he met his requirements. And it is just really a shame that people are continuing to bring this issue up. When -- I understand -- No, no, no, no. People asked for records to be released that would demonstrate he met his requirements. The records have now been fully released. The facts are clear -- Do you know that a lot of these payroll records are -- -- the facts are clear -- -- you cannot read them. Have you looked at these? You cannot -- how are we supposed to read these? Well, I think you can talk -- [CARDINAL], we put it out on email. It is a lot easier to read, I think, on the email version because that was the -- Oh, you did put it on our email? We are going to, if we have not already. But it was sent to us in email form from [ORG] in [GPE], [GPE]. [CARDINAL] other thing on this. To corroborate these records, will the President do [CARDINAL] things -- [CARDINAL], will he authorize the relevant defense agency in [GPE] to release actual pay stubs for the President? And if those do not exist, will the President file a form, as he can do at the [ORG], to at least look for a [DATE] [DATE] tax return that would corroborate what you claim are payroll summaries that he actually got paid for this duty? Well, I think this information is his payroll records. It is my understanding this is the information that is available from his payroll records. And it shows [DATE] on which he was paid. So that is the information that I understand is available. In terms of tax returns, the President, like most [NORP], does not have his tax returns from [DATE]. But it is possible that he could file a form requesting the [ORG] to search if they have a return for [DATE] or [DATE]. Is he willing to do that? Obviously, if there is any additional information that came to our attention that was relevant, we would make that information available. Well, it could be relevant if he would file a form -- I think that these documents clearly show that the President of [GPE] fulfilled his duties. I mean, these were the documents that people questioned and said should be made available. And we went back to double-check. We thought we had all the information that existed previously, but we went back to double-check after the comments that were made over [DATE], to see if there was any additional information available. And when we contacted [ORG] in [GPE], it was our understanding that [ORG] in [GPE] and [GPE] were already working to pull this information together, and that this is the information that they have that is relevant to this topic. So it is your position and it is the President's position that these documents put this issue to rest, period? Oh, I think these documents show that he fulfilled his duties. These documents show that he met his requirements. [INTERVIEWED1], [CARDINAL] questions, [CARDINAL] on the documents, [CARDINAL] on the issue. There seems to be a discrepancy now in the President's record that I wondered if you could help me with. These documents that you are holding up show that the President showed up for duty in [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] [DATE]. But the President's officer effectiveness report, filed by his commanders, Lieutenants Colonel [PERSON] and [PERSON], both now deceased, for [DATE], says he has not been observed at this unit, where he was supposed to show up and earning these points on [DATE]. How do you square -- You are talking about which unit? The [GPE] -- at [FAC]. From [DATE]? Correct. And certainly by -- the President said he returned to [GPE] in [DATE]. So some of these dates of service, which are in these records, ought to have been noted by his commanding officers, who, nevertheless, said, twice, he has not been observed here. Can you explain that? I am not sure about these specific documents. I will be glad to take a look at them. But these documents show [DATE] on which he was paid for his service. And the President -- as I have said, and we previously said during the [DATE] campaign -- recalls serving both in [GPE] and in [GPE] during the time period you are bringing up. So he served, but his commanding officers did not know it? Again, I do not know the specific documents you are referring to. If you want to bring those to me, I will be glad to take a look at them and get you the answers to your questions. Okay. Then on the general issue, Senator [PERSON] has said that [ORG] was [CARDINAL] way for people to avoid service in [GPE]. The President and [ORG] have taken umbrage at that, saying that is denigrating [ORG]. In [DATE], the President told [ORG], in relation to his joining [ORG], I was not prepared to shoot my eardrum out with a shotgun in order to get a deferment, nor was I willing to go to [GPE], so I chose to better myself by learning how to fly airplanes. It sounds like the President, himself, acknowledged that he went into [ORG] because he did not want to go to [GPE]. The President -- again, [PERSON], this issue has been addressed fully. Now we are trying to change into different issues here. The President was proud of his service in [ORG]. He fulfilled his duties; he was honorably discharged. I think there are some that we are now seeing are not interested in the facts. What they are interested in is trying to twist the facts for partisan political advantage in [DATE]. And that is unfortunate. It is a partisan issue. I am not doubting that, I am trying to explore it. [CARDINAL] of the reasons the [NORP] are raising it is because they have got a guy who was in [GPE]. Now it is -- he did not serve, now it is a different issue -- when the facts clearly show that he did serve, he did fulfill his duties, he did meet his requirements, he was honorably discharged. But he did not want to go to [GPE]. I think the facts are clear. It is clear that some are not interested in the facts. It is clear that some may be more interested in using this for partisan political advantage. [INTERVIEWED1], these are very hard to read, these payroll documents. Are you saying that every date listed on document [CARDINAL] is [DATE] that the President was actually -- showed up, he was suited up, he was flying planes -- that is what that means? Because there are, you know, points for active duty, points for inactive duty. What, exactly, are these? Well, and that is why we put out the statement from Mr. [PERSON], so you could put that in context. He is someone with the technical expertise that understands those matters and can explain what those points mean. And I think that his statement does that. In terms of the payments, you are paid for [DATE] on which you serve. [DATE] on which you serve, meaning he was actually there on these dates listed, he was actually there -- You are paid for [DATE] you serve. Is that what document [CARDINAL] is, the dates he served? Again, there was a time period when he was in [GPE], and he recalls serving in [GPE]. He was still a member of [ORG] at that time. What he was doing was performing equivalent duty, because he was working in [GPE] at the time. And he also remembers serving in [GPE], as well. [INTERVIEWED1], so, for example, in [DATE], the President served, according to this, on [DATE] in either [GPE] or [GPE] -- according to document [CARDINAL]. Is that correct? You are paid for [DATE] you serve. You have the documents right in front of you. These are documents straight from [ORG] -- Is that yes ? -- straight from [ORG] in [GPE]. Is that yes ? I said you are paid for [DATE] in which you serve. And, again, we are talking about [DATE], [PERSON]. The President recalls serving in [GPE]. He also recalls serving in [GPE]. That is what he recalls. And that is why -- But, again, -- I know you are going to bat this down, but there are people who -- You know, there were a lot of people calling for these records to be released. We finally came across these records. They have been released, and these documents reflect the fact that the President met his requirements and fulfilled his duties. And the fact that some of his officers do not recall ever seeing him, are you suggesting that they just do not remember after [DATE]? Well, I think I will let them speak for themselves. I am not sure that they exactly said it in that way. Some different ones said different things. They have. They have spoken for themselves. They do not remember. What is your answer to them about why they do not remember seeing the President? That the President recalls serving. I just said that. But why are they saying this? And if you look at the records, if you look at these records, these records document that the President fulfilled his duties. These records reflect that he met his requirements, both in point summaries and that he was paid for [DATE] in which he served. [INTERVIEWED1], can you just clarify, back to [PERSON]'s question here on document [CARDINAL]? For example, in [DATE], there are no dates that appear, meaning he did not show up then, or what -- Well, look, I mean, we are talking about [DATE], again. And these documents show the dates on which he was paid, which means those are [DATE] on which you serve. Does that mean, then, that he -- I do not have -- [PERSON], I am sorry, I do not have an hour-by-hour itemization of everything he was doing [DATE]. Are you able to make out any of the paid amounts? How much did he get? I cannot read the letters. And again, this is going to be put out in the email version, as well, and you are welcome to contact [ORG]. I am sure that they will be glad to help you, as well. [INTERVIEWED1], may I re-ask [PERSON]'s question? You keep saying he served -- he fulfilled his duty, he met his requirements. You are not saying, he drilled, he showed up, he attended. Is that intentional? No, he recalls performing his duties, both in [GPE] and [GPE]. I said that in response to [PERSON]'s question. Define that. Well, again, I do not have a minute-by-minute breakdown of every single thing he did throughout that time period. What did he do? You keep saying the word, serve. Define serve. He met -- he served both in [GPE], and he served both in [GPE]. Doing what? Did that period -- can you at least tell us the difference between inactive -- because it is not clear in these documents. No, I think that I will leave it to those who can explain these documents to do the explaining. That is why we put the statement from Mr. [PERSON], who was in [ORG] at the time; he was someone that had the expertise to explain to you what these points mean. And that is why we provided that statement. Obviously, [ORG] can tell you more about what everything means on these documents. We just received these [DATE]. But the [CARDINAL] thing that these documents clearly show is that the President of [GPE] fulfilled his duties when he was in [ORG]. He met his requirements and he was honorably discharged because he fulfilled his duties. Just so I can be sure that I am interpreting this crystal-clearly -- you are not making any claim here that the President attended, showed up, drilled on [DATE]? I am telling you that he did -- he does recall showing up and performing his duties. And you are paid for [DATE] on which you serve. And that is what these documents reflect. [INTERVIEWED1], is it your -- We are going to stay on this topic, and then we will jump to other topics. It is your position that these documents specifically show that he served in [GPE] during the period [DATE], when he was supposed to be there. Do they specifically show that? No, I think if you look at the documents, what they show are [DATE] on which he was paid, the payroll records. And we previously said that the President recalls serving both in [GPE] and in [GPE]. I am not interested in what he recalls. I am interested in whether these documents specifically show that he was in [GPE] and served on [DATE] during the latter part of [DATE] -- And I just answered that question. You have not answered that question. You -- No, I said -- no, I said, no, in response to your question, [PERSON]. No, so the answer is, no ? I said these documents show [DATE] on which he was paid. That is what they show. So they show -- they show that he was paid on [DATE]. Okay, but they do not show that he was in [GPE] when he was supposed to be -- These are payroll records, and they reflect the fact that he was paid on [DATE] on which he served. Do any of them show that he was paid on [DATE] that he served in the latter part of [DATE] when he was in [GPE]? I do not see any dates for that. It just kind of amazes me that some will now say they want more information, after the payroll records and the point summaries have all been released to show that he met his requirements and to show that he fulfilled his duties. But these documents do not show that. They do not show that he was in [GPE] and served at that time. I do not even see any pay dates during that period. They show payments. No, they show pay dates during that [DATE] period. They do? There is [DATE] on there, there is [DATE] on there, and then there is [DATE] on there, as well, in [DATE]. There is some pay dates on there. Okay, so then, do they specifically show that he served in [GPE] during that time? They show payments in [DATE]; they show payments in [DATE]. But just because he is paid does not mean that he served and worked there, does it? Come on. You know, like I said, people call on us to release the records. We did not even know they still existed until [DATE]. Now we have released the records, which document that the President fulfilled his duties. And now people are trying to move the goalpost even more. You said in [GPE] that he had served equivalent duty. That is right. Can you describe what that was, and what -- why did he need to move to [GPE]? What was -- Like I said, [PERSON], you are asking me to kind of break down hour-by-hour what he was doing during [DATE] and [DATE]. What these documents show is that he was serving in [ORG] and he was paid for that service. And they show that he was serving in [ORG] and that he met the requirements necessary to fulfill his duties. But his equivalent duty, does that he mean there was a base there he was flying out of? Is that what he recalls? I'd have to go back and double-check, but he remembers serving during that period and performing his duties, both in [GPE] and in [GPE]. And these are -- look, these are questions we addressed all during the campaign. The issue that came up recently was some were trying to make an outrageous, baseless accusation. If I recall, some were using the comment, deserter or AWOL. I mean, that is outrageous; it is baseless. The President of [GPE] fulfilled his duties, he was honorably discharged. And now there are some that are not -- are clearly not interested in the facts. They are clearly more interested in twisting the facts to seek a partisan political advantage in the context of [DATE]. And that is just really unfortunate that some would stoop to such a level. [INTERVIEWED1], what is it that took him to [GPE]? I am sorry? -- that took him to [GPE]? It was a campaign, a senatorial campaign. [INTERVIEWED1], we all know people who [DATE] may not show up for work and will be paid. And their payrolls will show they were paid. Well, again, when you are serving in [ORG] you are paid for [DATE] on which you serve. I mean, it is specifically related to the service. Could you walk us through the sequence of events in [DATE] that led to the production of these records? Sure, sure. And did those efforts begin after or before the interview with -- No, it was after. The questions came up in the interview on [ORG], and the President made it very clear, some of what I am saying here. And he said, yes, I want all records out there. And it was our belief, it was our impression that all the records that existed that were relevant were already released. Back in the [DATE] campaign, we went to [ORG] to ask for records so that they could be released, and it was our understanding that the payroll records -- it was our impression at the time that the payroll records did not exist. Then after [DATE], after the interview, we contacted [ORG] here and asked them where would one go, if these records existed, to find them. We were just going back and double-checking. And we were put in touch with [ORG] in [GPE], [GPE]. So we contacted [ORG] in [GPE], [GPE]. It was our understanding at that time that the [GPE] and [GPE] offices were already working to pull this information together at the time that we contacted them -- On their own? That is correct. They could explain more about why they were doing that. Did you contact them on [DATE], [INTERVIEWED1]? I will double-check. I believe it would have been probably [DATE] before we were able to reach them. So, [DATE] -- yes, [DATE]. I know there were conversations [DATE]. Who initiated the conversations? Oh, [PERSON], from here, Communications Director. Anyway, so he contacted them and found out that there was, indeed, additional payroll records. And the President authorized that those be made available, as he said he was going to do. He said he wanted all the records released that existed, that were relevant. And to our knowledge, this is all the records that exist that are relevant to this topic. The letter from Colonel [PERSON] says that he assessed the records. Did -- there is no indication that he had any direct oversight of President [PERSON]. Did he? I am sorry? That Lt. Colonel [PERSON], did he have any direct oversight over President [PERSON] at the time he served? I think he could address those questions, in terms of what his role was at the time in [ORG]. But he was certainly someone that had the technical expertise to be able to explain what the point summaries mean, in terms of the numbers, and what they reflect. So that is what he did. And he stated -- he made some comments back during the [DATE] campaign; I am sure you can go back and look at those, as well. Just to be clear, what he is saying [DATE] is that his assessment of the records is that the requirements were fulfilled. That the requirements were met. His own words are in his statements so I would refer you straight back to his words. When did [PERSON] make this memorandum? This one? Yes. In [DATE]. I think we received it [DATE] from him. -- [CARDINAL] date that I was -- Yes. Are you ready to take questions on a different subject? We are still on this topic, right? Since there have been so many questions about what the President was doing [DATE], what is it that he did after his honorable discharge from [ORG]? Did he make speeches alongside [PERSON], denouncing [GPE]'s racist war in [GPE]? Did he testify before [ORG] that [NORP] troops committed war crimes in [GPE]? And did he throw somebody else's medals at [FAC] to protest a war [GPE] was still fighting? What was he doing after he was honorably discharged? We have already commented on some of his views relating back to that period [DATE]. And, obviously, this was a time period also when he was going to get his MBA at [ORG]. But the President was certainly proud to serve in [ORG]. And would [ORG] consider those actions by Senator [PERSON], that [PERSON] mentions fair game in the political season? [PERSON], I think -- I know that that is a way to try to draw us into a [NORP] primary that is ongoing. You are there, my friend. Well, this is an important matter that some have chosen -- some have chosen to twist the facts. And it is important that the facts are clear. And I think that these documents clearly show that the President met his requirements and fulfilled his duties. But, look, we will let the [NORP] primary continue. They can work out their differences. I think if you have questions to address to people that made certain accusations, you should direct them to those individuals. Because now, in light of these documents, this is new information that clearly shows otherwise to what they were suggesting. [INTERVIEWED1], the President said clearly -- Let me keep going. I will come back to you. Wait [TIME] -- We have a few in the back. I will come back to you, I promise. But let me try to get to everybody in the room. I promise I will come back to you. [PERSON] I think had one, and then [DATE]. And did you have another one, [PERSON]? Kind of slipped one in there. The records show, [DATE] and [DATE] there was no pay period, he was not paid. That was when he was in [GPE]. Now, you said some of the payroll records were lost, but that you know he did not serve. And was this the President remembering he did not serve? I think it was for the fall period, when he -- and again, I'd have to go back and look at the exact dates of when he was in [GPE]. But it was during [DATE] that he made a request to perform equivalent duty in [GPE] again. That was still a period when he would be a member of [ORG]. But I'd have to go back and double-check those exact dates that he was in [GPE]. -- would not have been paid for equivalent duty? I am sorry? You would not be paid for equivalent duty. You are paid for serving. And equivalent duty is performing your duties for [ORG]. But the summary sheets state that he did not perform service in [DATE] of -- These are not our summary sheets, these are the summary sheets from [ORG] in [GPE]. -- payroll records were lost, but also, we know he did not perform service in [DATE]. You are paid for [DATE] on which you serve. So when he was in [GPE] during [DATE], he did not perform service -- Well, again, I am not sure that he was in [GPE] during that whole period you are talking about. I'd have to go back and look. He requested -- I know that he requested to perform equivalent duty during that fall time period when he was in [GPE]. You are going back further than that. I'd have to double-check. He left in [DATE], I believe -- I'd have to double-check the time period in which he was there. Is this cumulative, the sort of thing you do not have to perform [DATE], it is just a matter of, out of the course of [DATE], you get your [CARDINAL] points? You know, I am not -- there are people that have technical expertise in these matters. I think they are [ORG]. You can direct those questions to those individuals. I am sure that they would be glad to try to help you out. You keep saying this is a shame, and you are talking partisan politics, but do not you think the [NORP] public, as well, particularly the [GPE] military, who has been tested right now with the fact that they went to war on faulty intelligence, possibly, and now finding out that their Commander-in-Chief possibly tried to avoid going to the Vietnam War -- do not you think that the [NORP] public is owed a little bit more than photo copies that we cannot see things of? Do not you think the military is owed a little bit more than just, he served ? [PERSON], I am really sorry that you phrased that question the way you did, some of it, when you were saying that they are owed more than the documents that show that he served during that time period. Now, let me go back -- But would not someone know what he did? And the President -- we have previously said, going back to the [DATE] campaign and even before that, that he recalls performing his duties, both in [GPE] and in [GPE], during the time period that some have questioned. So let us be very clear about that. Let us be very clear about the facts. Because the [NORP] people should have the facts, and the facts are right here in these documents. The facts are right here in these documents. We cannot see facts. We cannot see -- these facts are very messed up, they are blurred. [DATE], I mentioned earlier that we were going to be putting this out on email, if we have not already, because it was sent to us in email form. You are also welcome to contact [ORG] in [GPE], [GPE]. I am sure that they will be glad to walk you through this. You are saying that this is political -- this is all politics and everything and people are obscuring in putting the facts up. But people are not able to stand up for the President. There are dates that are not accounted for. You cannot even tell us what kind of drills or what-have-you. What do you say to the [GPE] military -- No, we addressed all those questions back during the [DATE] campaign fully. Let me be very clear: The issue that came up recently was an outrageous, baseless accusation suggesting that the President did not serve and did not meet his requirements. People called on us to release records that might be available to show that he, indeed -- that he, indeed, did meet his requirements and serve and fulfill his duties. The records have been released. These records document that the President fulfilled his duties. Now people are wanting to go further than that. And these are the records that reflect his service. You can detail your job. You can detail what you do as Press Secretary -- And we did. During the [DATE] campaign, we talked about this issue fully. You are now going to a different issue. These issues -- It is still the same issue -- Let me be very clear here about this. There are some that made some very outrageous accusations about the President's time in [ORG]. There was a call for us to release payroll records. The payroll records have been released, as they just came to our attention and we shared them with you very quickly. The point summaries showing that he met his requirements have been released. Those were records that were -- that some called on us to release. We did not know that some of these records previously existed. Obviously, if they had, we would have been glad to share them with everybody at the time. This issue was addressed fully [DATE]. Like I said, it was really a shame that it came up [DATE], and it is really a shame that it is being brought up again [DATE]. The facts are clear. Now, there may be some out there that are not interested in the facts. And those people clearly are simply more interested in trying to seek a partisan political advantage in [DATE], then the facts. That is unfortunate. I do not really have a question that goes to the politics of this. I just want to ask a question about a contradiction, and a question about a specific record. After all of the things you repeated here, you cannot explain this contradiction, the fact that his payroll records indicate he was paid for a period of time for fulfilling service, and yet his commanding officers at that time wrote that he was not observed. Can you or can you not explain that contradiction? If you are talking about the question that [PERSON] brought up, I said I would glad to go back and look at the document that he is referencing. I have not -- You know the document he is referencing. Everybody does. His commanders -- No, I have not -- I have not seen the document he is referencing. -- are quoted repeatedly for [DATE] -- You are talking about quotes -- you are talking about quotes from individuals. And we said for [DATE], going back [DATE], that the President recalls serving and performing his duties. I understand that, but his commanders do not recall it. And, in fact, they say, that he was not observed. So can you explain the contradiction, or cannot you? I have seen some different comments he is -- no, I have seen some different comments made over the recent time period. I have not seen any different -- different comments from Brigadier General [PERSON], not from his [PERSON] commanders, who said he was not observed. Can you explain the contradiction? Look, I cannot speak for those individuals. I can speak for the President of [GPE]. And I can speak -- -- the documents -- And I can speak for the fact that the documents that -- as far as we know, all the documents that are available relevant to this issue demonstrate that the President fulfilled his duties. Are you suggesting these documents do not reflect that? I am not suggesting -- I am asking, that is all I am doing. Here is the second point, the President said to [PERSON], very specifically, on [DATE], that he would be willing to provide pay stub records and tax return records to corroborate -- And we addressed this situation previously. -- wait [TIME] -- to corroborate -- It is the second time you have asked this question. Right, and I will ask it until we maybe get something -- which is to corroborate these payroll records that are coming from one source. Will he request that all the records are released, from [GPE] and from [GPE], to prove that he actually received money, not just that they say he did? These are the payroll records that we understand are available. This is it. -- all that is there -- It is our understanding that these are the payroll records that are available, yes. Just out of curiosity, how much money does a person get paid for each [DATE]'s service, and is there any evidence that [PERSON] might not have accepted the money, might have turned it down? Oh, [PERSON], you'd have to go back and ask at the time what the pay was. Again, it shows the dates on which he was paid. And I think this goes into some of the amounts here on these papers. [INTERVIEWED1], new subject? Same subject? Yes. Go ahead. Am I wrong in reading document [CARDINAL] that he did not perform [DATE] of service [DATE] -- Yes, we have been through this. Again, the documents -- I want to make sure that is correct. -- well, those are the documents. You have them right in front of you. I am not disputing these documents. In fact, I am saying that these documents demonstrate that the President fulfilled his duties. These are the payroll records. Which of these dates refers to [DATE] he served in [GPE]? I am sorry? Which of the dates in document [CARDINAL] -- If you look at the fall time period, that was a time period that he was in [GPE]. Again, [PERSON] asked this question earlier, and asked if it shows exactly where he was serving when he was paid. And I said, no. I said, what these documents show is that he was paid for [DATE] on which he was -- served. These are the payroll records that reflect [DATE] on which he served. On what date did he come back, did he return from [GPE]? I think we have been through some of these issues previously. I do not know the exact date off the top of my head. We will be glad to look back and try to get you that information. But those were all questions that were addressed previously. The relevant issue that was brought up by some recently was whether or not the President had served. The documents clearly show that the President served and met his requirements and fulfilled his duties. [INTERVIEWED1], could you just tell us, are these all the documents you got, you received, here at [FAC], from [GPE], or have you kept some in reserve? And also -- No, these -- -- do you expect any additional documents from [GPE] or from [GPE]? Well, as always, I said that we would -- if there is additional information that comes to our attention, we will make sure to get you that information. This is the information that we understand is available from [ORG] in [GPE], [GPE]. And that is all that they sent you, this is the extent of all the documents? Yes, this is what they sent us. And we just put it in our own email and sent it out for you all. [INTERVIEWED1], [PERSON] told [ORG], in [DATE], that he traveled to [ORG] and reviewed President [PERSON]'s military file. He said, I have read it, and there is nothing earth-shattering. Did he see these documents when he reviewed the file? Did he see any other documents when he reviewed the file? And was there anything in the file -- Well, that is a broad question about other documents. All the relevant documents relating to his service have been released -- So has [PERSON] ever seen these documents? -- as we said. And as I said [DATE], everything that we had we released in [DATE] -- I mean, [DATE], at the time, or during the [DATE] campaign. It might have been [DATE]. There may be documents that were in that file -- No, this is the first time this information has come to our attention. So [PERSON] did not see these documents -- Again, I think I have answered this question up here, and I have answered it back for you. I have got [CARDINAL] more -- We are going to keep moving. Any more on this topic? Do you have this topic, this topic? Then [PERSON] is a new subject. We are off this topic. Talk to me, [INTERVIEWED1] -- -- about -- I was trying to talk to [INTERVIEWER1] earlier, but he did not want me to talk. I was trying to get an answer, but you did not want to talk. Tell us what you told -- The cameras are on, and it is always great to have the cameras on. Ooooh -- Tell us what you told the [ORG] about the -- They are on you, my friend, not me. -- the outing, if you will, of [PERSON]? [PERSON], the President has made it clear that he wants to get to the bottom of this investigation. The leaking of classified information is a very serious matter. The President directed everybody at [ORG] to cooperate fully in the investigation. I, obviously, want to do my part to cooperate. And if there is something that can help those who are leading this investigation get to the bottom of it, I am more than happy to share that information with them. But if you have specific questions relating to an ongoing investigation, those questions are best directed to [ORG]. [ORG] is the one that is overseeing this matter. I want to do everything I can, if there is anything I can do, to help that investigation move forward so that we can get to the bottom of this. But there is no legal prohibition on you talking with us about what you told them. So if you would, tell us what questions they asked you, and tell us what answers you gave them. [PERSON], that is correct. But I think that it is best for me to refer those questions to [ORG]. Obviously, if they think it is helpful to the investigation to share that information, I am sure that they would. But I am going to do my part to cooperate fully in this investigation. And I am glad to do it. In doing that part, did you have information about how it was that Ms. [PERSON]'s job with the [ORG] became known -- Let me go back. I really -- I appreciate that you are asking these questions. I appreciate that you want to know this information, as well. But there is an ongoing investigation right now. We want to be as helpful as we can to those who are leading that investigation. That includes me personally, as well. And so we need to let that investigation proceed. If there is information that they feel is helpful to share publicly, I am sure that the people at [ORG] would. But I am just not going to answers those questions from this podium. Those questions are best directed to [ORG], because I want to help them move forward in this investigation. [INTERVIEWED1], I have a follow-up on that. You said [DATE] that you spoke with the Vice President's Chief of Staff, [PERSON], and that he was not the leaker, and he did not authorize the leak. Do you stand by that statement? [PERSON], we have addressed all these issues previously. There is now an ongoing investigation. And I think if you have got questions related to the investigation, I would suggest you direct those questions to [ORG]. Like I said, if there is information that they feel is helpful to share publicly, then I am sure that they will. Second question: The Vice President took [ORG] Justice [PERSON] on a duck hunting trip to [GPE] while the Vice President had a case pending before [ORG]. Does the President see this as appropriate behavior, taking a [ORG] Justice to a duck hunting trip while he has a case pending? And does he believe that Justice [PERSON] should recuse himself from that energy task force case? I think that you need to direct those questions to the Vice President's office. I do not have -- I am not -- I am asking the President's view. -- I am not familiar with the specifics. Can I go to the major international story appearing all over the globe? [GPE] now admits that [NORP] scientists are the source of spreading nuclear knowledge to several countries. And, also, [PERSON] is blaming [GPE] for not providing him the proof. And [DATE], at [ORG] -- speaking and she said that President [PERSON] should stop now supporting dictatorships, dictators in [GPE], but stop supporting -- and she said that [GPE], including President [PERSON] was misled by [PERSON] all along, including [DATE], on the spread of nuclear weapons or nuclear technology. Does President believe now that he is satisfied with [PERSON]'s speeches or what [PERSON] told President [PERSON]? Or do you think President will move to -- We certainly value the assurances that President [PERSON] provided. I think I have already talked about this. But proliferation is a very serious matter. It is a very high priority for this administration. In a post-September 11th world it is important that we do everything we can to stop proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. That is why the President launched the proliferation security initiative to work with other nations to interdict shipments of weapons of mass destruction, and to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. That is why the President is working closely with other nations to stop proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. And I think that if you look at some of the actions that have been taken in [GPE], it demonstrates that he is committed to the assurances he provided us. The results are that a network has been broken up, a network of proliferation has been broken up. There is still ongoing investigation. We are still looking at a number of other areas to continue to make sure we are doing everything to stop further proliferation efforts. And we will continue to make this a high priority. The President looks forward to talking more about this very issue [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED1], [CARDINAL] more -- [PERSON], go ahead. [GPE] would like [ORG] to play a larger role in [GPE], but the [ORG] Secretary General says [GPE] must come first. Is this going to cause a delay in turning [GPE] back to the [NORP]? Is what going to cause a delay? Well, doing [GPE] -- taking care of [GPE] first. First of all, we are continuing to move forward on the transition of sovereignty to the [NORP] people, based on the time line that was set out in the [DATE] agreement. Obviously, [ORG] was playing an important role in [GPE], and they have talked about expanding that role. And we appreciate the efforts of [ORG] in [GPE]. The President met very recently with the [ORG] Secretary General, and they had a good discussion about [GPE]. They also had a good discussion about [GPE]. And those are issues that we are continuing to look at and continuing to discuss with [ORG]. Is it possible the [DATE] deadline could slide? Actually, I have addressed this issue, I think, over [DATE] or [DATE], at least. But we are working closely with the [NORP] leaders and other [NORP] to move forward on the [DATE] time line for transferring sovereignty. It is important that we continue to move forward in a timely manner to transfer sovereignty back to the [NORP] people. They are assuming more and more responsibility for their future. And we look forward to continuing to work with them to help make -- help meet that time line. What is he doing [DATE], exactly? Well, he is going to be giving a speech on -- that will focus on proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Obviously, in a post-September -- Where? Here in [GPE] Obviously in a post-September 11th world, it is a high priority to confront the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction. There are shadowy networks that exist that seek to spread weapons of mass destruction. There are stateless regimes that seek to acquire weapons of mass destruction. There are individuals who provide technology and know-how to rogue states. And it is a very serious issue. And that is why we have taken a number of steps to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, through some of the initiatives I mentioned earlier, as well as working individually with different nations around the world. Thank you. Thank you.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressgagglepresssecretaryjaycarney7", "text": "Can you tell us about the [NORP] pirate operation and what led the President to make those remarks to [PERSON] [TIME]? Well, it is true that the President, when he saw the Secretary of [ORG], as well as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, was congratulating them on a successful mission because he had been informed at, I believe, [TIME] of the success of the mission to rescue the [NORP] hostage as well as the [NORP] hostage. What led to it was the President was apprised of the fact that [PERSON] had been taken hostage back on, I believe it was [DATE] -- he was apprised of it [DATE], of the kidnapping, and was updated on it regularly. I think [ORG] has more details on this, but the decision to go ahead with this rescue mission was made because there was information concerning the deteriorating health of Ms. [PERSON], as well as a window of opportunity to try to execute this mission. The President made the decision [TIME] on -- let me make sure I get this right -- [TIME] on [DATE] night -- that is right -- when his counterterrorism advisor, [PERSON], briefed the President in the residence at [TIME] [DATE] night. And the President authorized the operation to proceed. Throughout [DATE] [DATE], the President received updates from Mr. [PERSON] and was told at [TIME] that Ms. [PERSON] and Mr. [PERSON] were safe and in [GPE] hands. [INTERVIEWED], did the President speak to the [ORG] team or the SEAL team commander [DATE] expressing his -- I have no calls to report. He did call -- upon return from finishing the State of the Union address, he called Ms. [PERSON]'s father at [TIME] -- [PERSON] -- and informed him of the successful mission. Was there any concurrent Situation Room monitoring of this whole thing, like the situation that went on during the [PERSON] operation? I would refer you to [ORG] for that kind of information. The mission was, as you would expect, monitored very closely throughout -- I mean, in [FAC] -- I think I just said that [PERSON] was briefing the President regularly in his offices in [FAC]. How does the President feel [DATE] about how the State of the Union went [TIME], the reaction to it? He feels very positive. He feels -- he felt good about the speech. He felt very satisfied with the way the speech came together and the message about laying out a Blueprint for an America Built to Last was both -- was well received both in the hall and outside, across the country. So he understands that while [CARDINAL] of [NORP] watched the speech [TIME], that part of his responsibility as President to try to move this agenda forward is to get out and talk about it around the country, which is why he is embarked on this trip [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED], the President has been talking about we cannot wait, but [DATE] he talked a lot about initiatives that would require congressional action, some of which have failed in the past -- oil subsidies -- cutting oil subsidies, fee on big banks, those sorts of things. What kind of expectation does he honestly have that these things will happen, or are they merely kind of leverage points in order to get other things from them? I will make [CARDINAL] points, [PERSON] -- I appreciate the question. As we have said all along, the President is using every tool in his toolbox to try to advance his economic and jobs agenda. That includes working with [ORG] on things that require legislative action, but it also includes doing everything he can through executive action. And that was reflected in the State of the Union address [TIME]. That has always been the case, and again, it was reflected [TIME]. He is not nave about the kind of resistance that he is faced from [NORP] members of [ORG] and the obstructionist approach that many [NORP] have taken to what is by any clear-eyed definition a very common-sense, centrist agenda. But he is also optimistic that there will be opportunities [DATE] to move important pieces of business through [ORG], not because suddenly [NORP] will relent out of charity or goodwill, but because they will be under pressure from their constituents to show that they are doing something constructive to grow the economy and create jobs. As I have said before, every single member of [ORG] who is not retiring is up for reelection [DATE], not just the President. [CARDINAL] of the [ORG] is up for reelection. And each of those elected representatives will have to explain to his or her constituents what they did in this [ORG] that helped [GPE], helped the economy, helped create jobs. And if the answer is, I just opposed everything that President [PERSON] put forward because President [PERSON] put it forward, even though a lot of his ideas reflected input from [NORP] or had their genesis in bipartisan proposals of [DATE], I think that is a hard message to sell. So we are hopeful that on a broad array of issues, whether it is helping ensure that [NORP] -- that every [NORP] can refinance, every responsible homeowner can refinance his or her home mortgage loan, or extending the payroll tax cut, or taking the action that the President will talk about [DATE] to enhance [NORP] manufacturing, make changes that are deficit-neutral to enhance [NORP] manufacturing -- is it really the position -- would it be the position of any member of [ORG] that they are against building the [NORP] manufacturing sector in this country, increasing the number of jobs that are available to [NORP] from that sector of the economy? Again, I'd like to hear the argument for that one. On the Buffett Rule, how did the President ultimately settle on [PERCENT]? And what have you guys thought about to put in place to prevent it from hitting small businesses? Well, first of all, I am not going to give you a schedule of how broad individual tax reform would break down and what impact it would have on capital gains or dividends or -- the principle the President laid out would guide, he believes very strongly should guide, tax reform. [PERCENT] makes a lot of sense and it is not surprising because [PERSON], on this issue, himself has made a lot of sense, and it was the figure I believe Mr. [PERSON] also put forward. Again, it is a principle, and there is a lot of data to back it up, that there are a lot of very fortunate [NORP], millionaires and billionaires, who pay taxes at a substantially lower rate than many, many [CARDINAL] of [NORP] of more modest means. The President simply believes that as a matter of principle, that unfairness ought to be changed. And not because it is class warfare, but because we have important priorities that need to be addressed in this country -- our national security, our investments in education and infrastructure, our commitments to our seniors -- and we are in a situation where we have to be very mindful of our fiscal health. So those are choices that have to be made, because if you do not insist that the tax code be fairer, that everyone does their fair share, then somebody else has to get stuck with the bill: seniors, middle-class [NORP], kids with disabilities. It is just -- it is a choice that -- or you just load up on the deficit and the debt. And the President is opposed to that. We have heard of a lot of tax plans lately that, among other things, would do the reverse of the Buffett Rule. They would lower taxes for millionaires and billionaires who are paying at a much lower rate than a lot of [NORP] with moderate incomes or eliminate them entirely. That is not the right approach. And in addition to doing that -- or as a result of doing that, they would further add to our deficit and debt. The President believes that is the wrong approach. [INTERVIEWED], he had a fairly pointed tone against the lack of bipartisanship in [GPE] [DATE]. Are we going to see that tone continue in [DATE]? Well, I will let you be the judge of that as we move through [DATE]. The President feels very strongly that outside of the Beltway, the nation is not nearly as divided as it is in [GPE], and that the partisanship for partisanship's sake is excessive and frustrating for most [NORP]. They just want to see [GPE] work on the problems that they face [DATE]. So I think, broadly speaking, the tone that the President adopted [TIME] will be reflected going forward, but it was also a very positive and optimistic tone. He is -- he rejects the idea that there are challenges out there that we cannot solve. He rejects the idea that [GPE] is somehow in decline. In fact, he feels just the opposite. And the remarkable progress that has been made in [DATE] since the worst recession since the Great Depression only reinforces his opinion that we are going to emerge stronger and better and with an economy that is built to last, as opposed to one that is built on ephemeral bubbles like the housing bubble or the Internet bubble or the financial sector bubble. The President had some stern words for [GPE] [TIME] on its trade practices. Are we going to hear more of that on this trip as he visits factories? Well, again, [DATE] he is focusing on what I described before about his -- the manufacturing pillar. Now, there is an element here to that that has to do with enforcement on trade, as he talked about [TIME]. When the President discussed this during his Asia trip, that everybody has got to play by the same set of rules, and that is important because he knows that when [NORP] manufacturers are put on a level playing field, they are the best there are, and they can compete. So obviously that is an important part of his agenda. But I do not want to quantify how much that will be a focal point in [DATE]'s events, for example, but it is an important aspect of what he discussed [TIME]. How would that proposal on education work, [INTERVIEWED], where the President said that schools -- colleges or universities that raise tuition would see a decrease in federal funding? And does that need legislative approval? The President will be discussing that specific proposal on [DATE] at [GPE], so I am going to let him give you more details. But the general principle is that if universities and colleges are not doing a good job of keeping costs down, or costs keep going up, then their support from the federal government will go down. He believes that is very important because [NORP] -- higher education cannot become an unaffordable luxury for regular [NORP] because if it does, the impact on our long-term economic prospects will be very negative. So he is committed to making sure that higher education -- quality higher education remains accessible to [NORP] of all economic backgrounds. But where would the teeth be? I mean, how would you enact -- I would let -- I would ask you to wait for the President to provide more details, and we will provide more details on [DATE]. [DATE]'s focus is manufacturing. Will he specify the manufacturing rate that he wants to see? Yes, he will specify -- he will give specifics [DATE], and we will provide you more details [DATE] about actions that [ORG] could take right away in a deficit-neutral way to enhance [NORP] manufacturing. Did he talk to you about seeing [PERSON] on the floor [DATE]? He just said it was wonderful to see her -- briefly when we were on the plane earlier talking about it. And you could tell I thought, personally, when you watched it. But that is all he said -- it was wonderful to see her. [INTERVIEWED], back to the [PERCENT] tax rate. Does [ORG] believe that [PERSON] recently disclosed taxes and the effective rate of [PERCENT] that he pays provides a foundation for making the argument? The President's approach on this issue long predates recent developments in the other party's primary campaign. As you know, he is been talking about the Buffett Rule for a number of months now. And the President's ideas are not focused on any individual. They are focused on a general principle that millionaires and billionaires, folks who have had the good fortune of succeeding, thanks to all that this country has to offer, need to do their fair share; that they should not be paying taxes at a lower rate because of loopholes or irregularities in the tax system than average [NORP]. But as you know events propel ideas, so is this an event that propels your idea? Well, again, the idea well predates the event that you are describing, and again, it is not targeted towards an individual. If this is a purely sort of campaign question about the President versus a potential [NORP] nominee, I'd refer you to [GPE]. Everybody good? Good. Anything else? How are you doing? I am great. I am a little tired, but pretty pumped up. It was [TIME] [TIME], for a variety of reasons, the speech and the mission.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretaryjoshearnest10", "text": "Good [TIME], everybody. Very calm in here. Let us see if we can keep it that way. [INTERVIEWED1], no pressure, but you will go first. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED1]. I wanted to start with a statement that President [PERSON] and some of the Western leaders released [TIME] on [GPE] and the crisis in [GPE]. And I was wondering if that statement was intended to signal support specifically for this [DATE] ceasefire that a number of [NORP] rebel factions are calling for, or if the leaders were just referring more generally to the crisis and trying to call attention to it. [INTERVIEWER1], my understanding is they are not seeking to show support for any one specific plan. There are a variety of proposals that have been put forward that would reduce the violence sufficiently to allow innocent [NORP] in [GPE] to get out of harm's way, and for the consistent flow of humanitarian aid to commence, particularly to those regions of the country and to those areas of the city that have been under siege for a long time. So as you'd expect, [INTERVIEWER1], these kinds of statements take some time to be negotiated through diplomatic channels, and so this is not in response to [CARDINAL] specific proposal that is been put forward, but rather demonstrating clear, unified international support for some kind of diplomatic arrangement that reduces the violence and allows the flow of humanitarian assistance to commence in a sustained way. And the statement was very critical, even condemning, of [GPE] for its role in facilitating the continuation of violence through its actions at the [ORG] and elsewhere. And I am wondering, given the fact that the [GPE] is still talking with [GPE] about this -- I believe Secretary of [ORG] [PERSON] is meeting [PERSON] even [DATE] in [GPE] -- what is the utility of continuing to try to work with [GPE] on that when we are , in the same breath, saying you guys are the problem, you are the reason that there is not progress on this? Well, [INTERVIEWER1], I think the strategy is essentially to apply pressure to [GPE] because of the tactics that they have been willing to not just condone but, in some cases, actively support that have resulted in significant innocent loss of life. And it is continuing. And the President does not believe it is an effective strategy to gloss over or somehow obscure [GPE]'s complicity in this sordid affair in order to reach a solution. In fact, we actually believe that [GPE] bears special responsibility to help bring about a diplomatic solution because of the way that it intervened on behalf of the [PERSON] regime and because of their own stated significant national interest in the outcome of the situation inside of [GPE]. So we are not going to advance a diplomatic solution by somehow acting like [GPE] has been a good actor when they have not , or pretending that [GPE] somehow does not have a stake in the outcome when the truth is they have got as big a stake in the outcome as any other country outside of [GPE]. So it is time for them to play a responsible role. And thus far, they have not . And that is isolated them in the international community. It is what makes them the object of so much criticism and even scorn from the international community because of their willingness to support actively the depraved tactics of the [PERSON] regime to try to bomb innocent civilians into submission. [NORP] President [PERSON] has given out a readout of his recent conversation with President-elect [PERSON] and he says that [PERSON] said basically, do not worry about [GPE] concerns about your fight against drug criminals; go ahead, you are doing a good job. How alarming is that to the [GPE], given that what we are essentially talking about -- or what you have talked about from that podium is the killing of [CARDINAL] of people without any kind of due process? [INTERVIEWER1], I have no special knowledge of the telephone conversation between the President-elect and the President of the [NORP], so I cannot be in a position to critique the view that is being expressed by the President-elect to the President of the [GPE]. What I can do, however, is restate the position of this administration, the position of the current [GPE] government, and that is simply that extrajudicial killings are entirely inconsistent with the notion of the rule of law and a commitment to upholding basic, universal human rights. It is plain and simple. There is a significant challenge facing the government of the [GPE] to combat the drug trade in their country. And it raises significant questions about their economy and about the security situation in the [GPE]. That is a legitimate problem that is worth confronting. And, in fact, [GPE] has been supportive of previous efforts by the [GPE] to confront the drug trade and try to limit, if not eradicate it. But President [PERSON] has certainly raised concerns about the degree to which his government is at least willing to look the other way while these kinds of extrajudicial killings are taking place and while vigilante justice is being meted out. That is not going to solve the problem. The President gave a long speech about this [DATE], about how it is important that our efforts to advance the interests of [GPE] and provide for the security of [GPE] is enhanced when we do it consistent with our values. That same principle applies to other countries, as well. The other principle that I think is at stake here is a little higher-level principle, but it is an important one nonetheless. [CARDINAL] of the reasons that it is important for us to invest in the durability and strength of our alliances is so that we can acknowledge publicly when we disagree. It is the sign of a strong relationship that we can acknowledge differences of opinion and encourage our closest friends around the world to live up to the values that our countries and our people prioritize. It is a sign of weakness in a relationship if you cannot acknowledge differences of opinion. That is true in interpersonal matters; it is also true in international diplomacy. And we do not agree with our allies on every issue. And preserving the strength of those alliances and investing in the strength of those alliances allows us to, where appropriate, air those differences and not shy away from them. And in this case, it is important because [GPE] draws upon our adherence to these values because it contributes to our influence around the world. Countries want to be allied with [GPE] because they recognize what it is that we stand for. And when we stay true to those values, it only enhances our influence around the globe. That makes us safer. And signaling a willingness to backtrack from those values is bad for our individual relationships, but it is also bad for -- degrades our ability to exert our influence around the world. And lastly, is [ORG] amenable to adding a provision in the short-term spending bill to essentially fast-track a waiver for General [PERSON], given that the President is going to have to sign this bill to keep the government funded? Well, there are a couple of principles at play here, [INTERVIEWER1]. The first is that President [PERSON] has long made the argument that while the [ORG] does have some responsibility to confirm the President's nominees -- to offer that advice and consent is a fundamental responsibility of the [ORG] -- at the same time, the President of [GPE] should be given a lot -- significant latitude to assemble his team. In many instances, that courtesy was not extended to this President by [NORP] in the [ORG]. But the President believes that is an important principle. And again, that is a principle that can be faithfully observed without eroding the constitutional responsibility of [ORG] [ORG] to offer their advice and consent. Second, when it comes to General [PERSON], we are talking about somebody that President [PERSON] knows. General [PERSON] served as the commander of [ORG] for [DATE] while President [PERSON] was in office. He is somebody who served his country with distinction. He is a decorated [ORG] veteran. But President [PERSON] believes that -- well, the standard that we have tried to set is to not comment on, pass judgment on the individuals that the President-elect has put forward to serve in his [ORG]. And I am going to try to abide by that principle here. This is not really about General [PERSON] and his own views on issues or anything. It is about the fact that he is a general, and that in order for him to be confirmed there would have to be a waiver passed by [ORG] to permit that. So it is kind of a different principle. Yes, well, I think all these principles come into play, though. And I certainly would not want any sort of commentary about this matter to be construed as some sort of implicit criticism of General [PERSON] -- for a variety of reasons, including he is somebody who has served this country with distinction under [NORP] and [NORP] Presidents, and he is supported, based on the public comments I have seen, by both [NORP] and [NORP] that he is interacted with in the context of his job. What I will say seems odd is that [ORG] [NORP] feel the need to tuck this provision into a budget bill in order to advance it, instead of having this question of a waiver be considered on its merits. So the kind of tactics and legislative strategy, to the extent there is one, that has regularly been applied by senators in the [ORG] is one that I have been mystified by in the past, so this is not exactly an unprecedented kind of situation. But, in general, what I can say is that President [PERSON] believes in the principle of the President being able to assemble a team. He certainly believes in the principle that somebody like General [PERSON] is a decorated [NORP], has demonstrated his patriotism and service to the country, has served this country with distinction, but ultimately the President-elect and the next [ORG] are going to have to determine how exactly to advance his nomination to the [ORG]. More on appointments. [DATE], President-elect [PERSON] told the Today Show that he has consulted President [PERSON] about some of his appointments and that he takes the President's recommendations very seriously, and also that I guess [CARDINAL] of the appointments or some of the appointments were highly -- or were liked by President [PERSON], according to President-elect [PERSON]. So I just wondered -- I know that you have declined to kind of talk about what the President thinks of all the appointments, but I guess what type of advice is the President giving to President-elect [PERSON]? [PERSON] talked about it [DATE]. So what type of advice is he giving him as he appoints his [ORG]? And also can you speak even about this kind of burgeoning relationship? I mean, at this point, [PERSON] has repeatedly said that he likes President [PERSON] and he thinks President [PERSON] likes him, too. So can you talk about this relationship? This would probably make for an interesting episode of Dr. Phil. Not that I am giving them any programming ideas -- but they can take that one and run with it. Look, I know that the President-elect had an opportunity when he was asked in an interview to talk a little bit about his consultations with President [PERSON]. And he is the President-elect of [GPE], and he is on the other end of the phone when the President is talking, so he is got a little more latitude to do that than I do. I am going to, from here, in my role, going to protect the ability of the President of [GPE] to consult in private with the President-elect. I have , on a number of occasions, confirmed that there have been at least a handful of conversations between the President and the President-elect, in addition to the [FAC] meeting that all of you observed, something that took place [TIME] after the votes were tallied on [DATE]. And after that meeting, the President-elect told all of you that it was his expectation the he would consult frequently with the President of [GPE] because he believed it would be helpful to him. And since that time, we have made clear that President [PERSON] was not just a willing participant in those kinds of conversations but that he would welcome the opportunity to be as helpful as he possibly could to the incoming President. And that is what he has tried to do. That is what we have tried to do as an administration in terms of ensuring a smooth and effective transition to the next administration. But for the content of the conversations that are occurring between the [CARDINAL] men, that is not something that I am going to speak about from here. So there is no -- like you could not talk about maybe an overarching kind of guidance that he is trying to give him when it comes to the [ORG]? Look, I think the way that I would describe it is consultation, and the President is responsive to requests and phone calls from the President-elect. But beyond that, I just do not have any additional insight that I can share about the nature of the telephone conversations. Going back to [GPE], I just want to be clear. Does the administration have a position on what the rebels should do? Should they withdraw from [GPE]? I guess [GPE] and [GPE] have called for that, said they will not consider a ceasefire until the rebels leave [GPE]. Does the [GPE] have a position on that? The [GPE] position is that [ORG] is working tirelessly to try to broker the kind of ceasefire in [GPE] that would allow for the significant flow of badly needed humanitarian assistance. The opposition has agreed to the [ORG] plan. And we believe that the [NORP] should, too. We believe that the [NORP] should use their influence with the [PERSON] regime to get them to agree to that plan. But whether it is the [ORG] plan or some other diplomatic negotiation that results in a reduction of violence and an increase in humanitarian assistance, that is what we are after. And the chief obstacle to that goal has been the depraved military tactics of the [PERSON] regime and the complicity of the [NORP] and [NORP]. And that is the position that we are trying to get them to change. And it is a position that, thus far, has resulted in widespread bloodshed and a genuine human tragedy inside of [GPE]. And the longer that the [NORP] government and the [NORP] and [NORP] resist this potential solution, the more conflict and more violence and more bloodshed and more tragedy will occur. Just to clear up some of these things that have been said on both sides of these phone calls between the President and President-elect -- does the President enjoy these phone calls? The President is pleased that he can play a role in ensuring a smooth and effective transition. And that is something that he has identified as a very high priority, particularly for [DATE] in office here. So he is certainly pleased that he can offer advice and assistance that may be useful to the incoming administration. And now that President-elect [PERSON] has been pretty detailed in his description and he, just [DATE], as [PERSON] was saying, he said that he really does like -- that he loves getting his ideas. Can it at least be said -- does the President like [PERSON]? Does he like talking to him as a person? Listen, for the President's personal feelings you should just talk to the President about that. And it is important that -- we will do another news conference here and maybe somebody will choose to ask. But I cannot speak to their personal relationship. What I can speak to is the President's ongoing commitment to coordinating effectively with the President-elect's team and the President-elect personally to ensure a smooth and effective transition. And that is included not just in the [FAC] meeting [TIME] after the votes were tallied, but it is also included additional telephone calls between the [CARDINAL] men and a variety of meetings at a variety of levels at agencies all across the federal government to give the incoming administration the best opportunity to get off to a running start. Since the last time we asked you about these phone calls -- and you mentioned that there had been a handful -- have there been any more [DATE] now? I do not remember exactly the last time that I was asked, so I cannot confirm any additional calls at this point. [CARDINAL] thing you have spoken to a number of times both before and after the election are what you call the deep concerns that the President has going forward with this new administration. So is it safe to say that the President still has concerns about some of the picks that [PERSON] has made? Well, I do not have a -- we are not going to take a position on individual nominees that are put forward by the President-elect. I think what those deep concerns often referred to were some of the rhetoric and policy positions that were advocated by Mr. [PERSON] when he was running for President. But elections have consequences. And while those concerns have not gone away, the election is over, and the institutional responsibility of the President and everybody who works for him is to focus on putting our political differences and our political opinions aside and fulfilling the duties that the [NORP] people have entrusted us with, which is to serve the public and to give the choice of the [NORP] voters the opportunity to succeed in [DATE]. So the numerous concerns that both the President and you listed have not been assuaged at all by anything you have seen since the election? Listen, I think it is too early to judge. And people all across the country will have the opportunity to do exactly that. And, look, President-elect [PERSON] ran for office advocating a much different approach to running the country than the one that President [PERSON] has pursued over [DATE]. He said he wanted to do things differently and he found a variety of very colorful ways to make that quite clear to everybody who was walking into the voting booth. And the outcome of the election is such that Secretary [PERSON] got [CARDINAL] more votes, but President-elect [PERSON] won the election. He won [ORG]. He will be the next President of [GPE]. And the [NORP] people will have an opportunity to see whether or not the different kind of approach that he is advocating actually yields better results. So we certainly want people to understand exactly what kind of progress this country was able to make under the leadership of President [PERSON], to persuade them of the wisdom of that approach so that they will be able to evaluate it against the kind of changed approach that President-elect [PERSON] is vowing to pursue. Over [DATE] we have heard some pretty heavy criticism of certain of [PERSON] picks. And I know you do not want to get into individual assessments or anything, and I am not asking for that. But when you talk about concerns that are still there, do those include the people that he is choosing to be around him? Well, I do not want to signal a position one way or the other on some of --on any of the President-elect's personnel decisions. I think the obvious thing that I would be willing to say is that President-elect [PERSON] is choosing people with different views and different styles than the kinds of people that President [PERSON] chose. And the [NORP] people were very well served by the service of people like Secretary [PERSON], who has effectively implemented the Affordable Care Act; or Secretary [PERSON], who has implemented a series of reforms and reduced the backlog at the [ORG], and expanded and improved the delivery of benefits being provided to our veterans; or there are people like Secretary [PERSON], who has undertaken significant efforts to strengthen our military and making sure that we are making smart planning decisions so that the future of the [GPE] military is effectively adapted to the challenges that we may face moving forward. So, look, I could cite examples all across the administration, not just at the [ORG] level, but also at [ORG]. The kinds of people that President-elect [PERSON] has chosen appear to have, in many cases, different priorities, different styles and, in some cases, starkly different bank accounts. But the President-elect should benefit from the latitude -- significant latitude to choose his team. -- a little contrast there? Yes, I think I am. I do think that over -- look, at the end of [DATE], we will have a variety of benchmarks and metrics to evaluate how [GPE] benefitted from the priorities, agenda, and leadership style of President [PERSON]. And there will be a very clear opportunity for all of you, in particular, to evaluate whether or not the kinds of changes that President-elect [PERSON] puts in place benefit the country. And that is an open question, but it is an experiment that the [NORP] people in all their wisdom have chosen to conduct. Are you saying their bank account affects someone's capability? Not at all. I think it -- I do not think it would actually have much of an impact at all on anybody's ability to serve the country. Why did you say it then? Mostly to be funny. And it got a couple of chuckles. Thanks for spelling that out. I guess that goes to that old adage, though, if you have to explain the joke, it was not that funny. So maybe it was not . Okay, the CR. Yes. Yes, it came out [TIME] -- [DATE], a lot of riders, but a lot of funding. Will the President sign it? Well, I can tell you that the President and his team were up [TIME] -- I do not know if the President was up [TIME] reviewing the bill, but the President's team, the experts at the [ORG] and other agencies that are trying to understand the consequences of some of the proposals that are included in the CR have been carefully analyzing that. I am not ready to render a judgment [CARDINAL] way or the other on the proposal. But I can tell you that we continue to review the legislation and are looking at the finer points to make sure we understand exactly what impact the passage of the bill would have on funding the [GPE] government. Do you believe that we can avoid a government shutdown in [DATE]? Is there enough time to pass this CR? Well, I am certainly no expert on legislative procedure and as I have observed on many other occasions, even simple things have posed a significant challenge to this [NORP]-led [ORG], so I am not making any predictions. I certainly hope we will be able to avoid a government shutdown. I cannot envision a scenario in which the [GPE] economy or the [NORP] people somehow benefit from a government shutdown. So hopefully that is something we will be able to avoid. What it will require is something that it is required [DATE], which is compromise. And that is another thing that [NORP] in [ORG] have not demonstrated much of an ability to do. But it will be required in this instance. It is going to require bipartisan compromise for this bill to pass both houses of [ORG] and be signed into law by a [NORP] President. The President is willing to compromise. He does not expect that every element of the CR should be something that he wholeheartedly supports. He recognizes that this will be a compromise. But we are taking a look at the bill to understand exactly what sort of compromise will be required, and we will let you know as soon as we can about the final conclusion that is been reached. Do you expect to have a judgment [DATE] on that? I do not know how much progress they have been able to make on it [DATE], but we will keep you posted. Anything on the General [PERSON]-Ambassador [PERSON] meeting? I do not have anything on that. I know that there have been some reports about Ambassador [PERSON] meeting with the individual that the President-elect designated to succeed her in the fancy corner office in [ORG]. What I can tell you is that, more generally, [ORG], under the leadership of Dr. [PERSON], has spent [DATE] preparing materials, assembling briefing books, compiling information to ensure a smooth and effective transition into the next administration. So I am not in a position to confirm any individual meetings that have taken place, but I can tell you that there have been a variety of meetings that have already occurred that are focused on achieving that goal. And when we are talking about [ORG], we are talking about the organization that is responsible for managing a range of very sensitive issues. So a lot of close coordination and consultation will be required to ensure a smooth handoff here. And we are certainly committed -- and I know that Dr. [PERSON] is personally committed -- to ensuring that we are going to do everything that is required to make that happen. The statement on [GPE] by the [CARDINAL] nations, how was that initiated? Was that something that the President initiated? Or who? I am not sure, you may have answered that. But I -- Yes, I am not aware that there was any individual presidential-level conversation about this. But obviously the President has had a number of conversations with some of the world leaders who signed on to this statement about the situation in [GPE]. I ask because you have always emphasized how the President is trying to use every diplomatic means available to him to effect a more positive situation there. So this does not fall into that category? Well, no -- look, the President has worked assiduously to mobilize the international community to respond to the situation inside of [GPE], and there were a number of conversations that President [PERSON] has had with the leaders of these countries who signed on to the statement in a variety of settings. And this has been a long-running effort. And, look, I think this is a good example of how [GPE] leadership is important in the international community and is effective in advancing our interests. It does not benefit [GPE] for there to be continued chaos inside of [GPE]. And President [PERSON] continues to rally the international community both through our counter-ISIL coalition, but also through diplomacy like this to try to find the kind of diplomatic solution that will bring an end to the violence inside of [GPE] that will expedite the provision of humanitarian assistance, but also make the world safer for the [NORP] people. In an interview -- in a tease about an interview that the President did on [ORG] -- I believe it was about [ORG] -- he said something to the effect that [ORG]'s ability to launch a major land offensive was not on my radar. Have you heard that? I think this may be the [ORG] documentary that is running [TIME]. So the statement, again, [ORG]'s ability to launch a major land offensive was not on my radar -- does that suggest a huge failure on the part of the administration to see this threat coming? Maybe you are making a reference to an event that is not coming to mind here. What are you referring to here? The President's statement in this interview where he said, [ORG]'s ability to launch a major land offensive was not on my radar. So you are talking about in [GPE] in [DATE]? Exactly. Okay. I thought this was a reference to the President's speech [DATE]. But now I see what you are trying to talk about. Look, I think this may be a situation where let us take a look at the President's -- the entire context of the President's remarks. I think we have talked a lot about how the [NORP] security forces did not perform at a level that we expected them to, even in the face of this threat from [ORG]. And that is something that I know that I have talked about from here, and something the President has talked about before. But we will take a closer look at the President's comments when they air in full [TIME]. He seemed to suggest an intelligence failure -- or admit one -- on the part of [GPE] -- not necessarily a failure by the [NORP], a failure on the [NORP] side to see this coming. Lastly, what does the President think of [PERSON] in [DATE]? I have not asked him about it. I think that as the Vice President was answering the question, I think that he -- well, I did not talk to the Vice President about it either, so -- You could not think of anything funny to say? Well, not for the first time in my life and certainly not for the first time in the context of this job. I will let the Vice President's comment stand. And if he chooses to further clarify them, then he will do that himself, or I will have a conversation with him and see if I can bring some greater clarity. INTERVIEWER1, nice to see you. Nice to see you. The President, [DATE] in his remarks, talked about [FAC] -- [CARDINAL]' expense to keep [CARDINAL] guys there, a blot on our national conscience. But he stopped short of saying that he is actually going to shut the place down before he leaves. Was this a final sort of coming to terms with the fact that the prison is going to stay open after he leaves office? Well, listen, we have been deeply dismayed at the obstacles that [ORG] has erected to prevent progress on this significant national security priority. [NORP] and [NORP] national security experts strongly support the President's position that closing the prison at [FAC] would save taxpayer dollars and make the country safer. A variety of military leaders have reached that conclusion. Even President [PERSON], who has different views on foreign policy than President [PERSON] in most areas, but in this area, he agrees that the prison should be closed. So there is strong bipartisan agreement among those who have dedicated their lives to protecting the country that the prison at [FAC] should be closed, and the [NORP] people would benefit from it. But this is a political situation that members of [ORG] in both parties, to be fair, have allowed to persist that prevents this kind of common-sense policy from being implemented. That is been deeply disappointing to the President. And we are going to continue to do everything we can [DATE] departure to reduce the prison population at [FAC]. And there is a strategy that we have initiated that includes the individual review of these prisoners to determine the wisdom of transferring them overseas. And when this interagency panel determines that an individual, under the right restrictions, can be safely transferred to another country, we are doing the important diplomatic work of finding another country who will take them. And since President [PERSON] has been in office, there are [CARDINAL] [FAC] detainees that have been transferred under these conditions. And that is been good for the country. But [ORG] has repeatedly thrown up obstacles that prevent the successful closing of the prison. That was not admitting defeat? Well, the President has been deeply disappointed by how [ORG] has refused to fulfill their basic responsibility to save taxpayer dollars, or at least spend their money judiciously, and enhance the national security of [GPE]. On both metrics, with regard to this policy, [ORG] has fallen down on the job. And that is been a source of significant frustration that we have expressed from time to time over [DATE]. You talked about some of the national security officials who support closure. [CARDINAL] of them who clearly did not is the man who looks to be the new [ORG] chief, General [PERSON], who has argued that [FAC] is not only operated well, but that it has a place in our national security framework, and prisoners should be there. So is the President disappointed to see that the President-elect is putting someone into this position who is on record saying no one is innocent at [FAC] and that it should stay open? Listen, I want to be real clear about our position about the need to close the prison at [FAC] should not be viewed by anybody as an attempt to impugn or criticize the service of our men and women in uniform who are operating that prison. That is difficult work. And so I do not want this policy position to be portrayed by somebody as a criticism of our men and women in uniform. With respect to General [PERSON]'s comments, I am going to reserve comment on anybody that President-elect [PERSON] has put forward for a senior [ORG]-level position. Obviously, as I alluded to earlier, many of them have positions that are different than positions that this administration has prioritized. And that is not particularly surprising given the outcome of the election. But I do not have a specific reaction to General [PERSON]'s stated position on this issue. A question on [GPE], to come back to it? Sure. In the language of the statement you released [TIME], you seem to be suggesting something like sanctions. You said restrictive measures on entities and individuals are being considered . You have got sanctions on [GPE], sanctions on [GPE], sanctions on the [PERSON] regime. These are all punitive. They are clearly not prohibitive. They have done absolutely nothing to stop the violence in [GPE] or in [GPE]. So is this kind of rhetoric the extent of the action [GPE] and the world powers are going to take right now? Well, the extent of the action that we are taking is, first and foremost, military action against [ORG] terrorists and other extremists inside of [GPE] that are trying to capitalize on the chaos to plot and execute attacks against [GPE] and the West. And so -- Well, the statement was about that [CARDINAL] 000 civilians and children are being denied medicine and food. That is what you are statement was about. That was what the statement was about. But people should not be confused about the totality of [GPE] action to protect the [NORP] people and advance our interests around the world, including in [GPE]. And our actions in [GPE] have taken [ORG] leaders off the battlefield. They have taken other extremists off the battlefield, including extremists who are plotting and planning to carry out attacks against [GPE] and our allies in the West. And so there is a lot of focus on the situation in [GPE], and there should be. In fact, there probably should be more. But we should not allow the tragedy in [GPE] to obscure the important work that is being done by the [GPE] military and our [CARDINAL] coalition partners to take the fight to [ORG], to increase pressure on extremists, and to enhance the national security of [GPE]. With regard to [GPE], our efforts do not just include negotiations among [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], and the [GPE] They also include supporting a [ORG] effort to try to facilitate a diplomatic agreement. And they also include extensive repeated discussions with the [NORP] to try to bring them to the negotiating table so that they use their influence with the [PERSON] regime to get us closer to an agreement. But the [NORP] have been resistant to doing that. And that is what is allowed this tragedy to continue. But ultimately, [GPE] is playing a leading role in the international community -- to organize the international community to apply pressure to [GPE], [GPE] and [GPE] to bring them to the negotiating table. They are going to have to be a part of any negotiated solution. And that is what we are trying to bring about. Respectfully, the international community efforts -- [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] [ORG] resolutions have been killed so far, all the diplomatic talks have failed. So that is why the question -- The reason why we are still working on it is because we have not gotten the results we'd like to see yet. But it is just rhetoric, it is just words at this point. And there is an immediate crisis. I mean, [PERSON] is talking to [PERSON] [DATE]. He is going to [GPE] [DATE]. But in the meantime, there are people very much in crisis, which is what your statement is about. So is the statement the extent of immediate action? No. There is a meeting with [GPE] that Secretary [PERSON] is planning [DATE]. There are continued efforts at the [ORG] to apply diplomatic pressure to the situation. There are continued talks that are being led by the [ORG] to try to facilitate a diplomatic agreement. If there were an obvious or simple military solution, it is certainly possible that [GPE] and our allies, or at least our partners in the counter-ISIL coalition, would have considered it by now. But we have said from the beginning, from [DATE], that the ultimate solution here is a diplomatic one. And diplomacy is hard. And [GPE], in particular, has been resistant to engaging constructively in pursuit of that negotiated solution. And we have been profoundly disappointed by that, and lives have been lost as a result of that. There is no denying that. But it is certainly not for any sort of lack of effort or lack of action on the part of [GPE]. And we continue to mobilize and lead the international community both to look after the national security interests of [GPE] but also to try to bring this human tragedy to an end. What are the restrictive measures that you are talking about in the statement? Well, there are a variety of things that have been considered, including the kinds of financial penalties that [GPE] has been able to apply in coordination with our allies in a variety of situations. And I certainly would not rule out something like that in the future, but I would also acknowledge that we have not seen those sorts of sanctions bring about the entirety of the change in strategy that we'd like to see. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED1]. Is the President aware of the declared mistrial in the case of the [GPE] officer that killed [PERSON]? What is his reaction to that? He is aware of that, [PERSON], and the reason I cannot offer you a reaction is that the police officer in question is facing civil rights charges that were brought by [ORG]. So there is an ongoing legal proceeding, and I would not want to say something or comment on this situation in a way that could have an impact on that legal proceeding. So [ORG] is going to continue to do their work, and that is work that they have done independent of any sort of direction or opinion that has been shared by the President of [GPE]. Any idea if the President might accelerate the number of commutations [DATE] of his administration? [ORG] had a fairly interesting piece, in [CARDINAL] part lauding him for doing something on criminal justice reform that he was not able to do broadly, and yet they also point out that there are [CARDINAL], perhaps even [CARDINAL] of people that might be candidates for that sort of special consideration. [PERSON], when the President was asked about this question back in [DATE] at the [FAC], he made clear that there is a process that [ORG] is administering to consider individually the applications for clemency that have been submitted, and the President does not envision circumventing that process. His expectation, and what we have tried to do particularly over [DATE] or [DATE], has been to turbocharge that process, to offer more resources to that process, so that it can function more efficiently, and to consider more applications. But I do not envision a scenario in which that process is somehow shortened or that we cut corners in that process so that more individuals can benefit from this clemency. The President believes that rigor being applied to that process benefits the [NORP] people and benefits those who are given this special opportunity for a second chance. I know I have asked you previously about the President's comments about Pearl Harbor Day, and I know that there is something scheduled for [DATE]. I am just curious, how is he spending [DATE] Pearl Harbor Day? Is he reaching out to any veterans or doing anything in particular [DATE]? I am not aware of any specific actions on the part of the President, but obviously he had an opportunity on [DATE], [DATE], to travel to [FAC] to lay a wreath at [FAC], and to restate once again the profound debt that we owe to military veterans of all generations, including the Greatest Generation. And this was a generation that was summoned to action based on the tragic attack perpetrated by the [NORP] [DATE] [DATE]. And I think all of us, including the President, have thoughts of deep gratitude for the sacrifice and service of the Greatest Generation of [NORP]. And the President himself has talked quite a bit about his grandfather who served, I believe it was in [ORG], in World War II in the [NORP] theater. And that is his own personal connection to that generation. And I think all of us, to one extent or another, even though many of them are no longer living, have our own connection to those who served and to those who fought and even those who died in ensuring that tyranny was defeated in World War II. Last thing, I wanted to ask you about welfare reform. [ORG] [NORP] are said to be considering laying the groundwork for a fresh effort to overhaul the food stamp program and coming up with different work and eligibility requirements. And I ask you that in part because I remember previously [DATE] you talked about the steep decline in the rate of poverty growth in [GPE]. And so I am wondering if [ORG] feels like now is a good time for a fresh look at [ORG]. Well, I have not seen the individual proposals that have been put forward by [NORP], so I do not know if I can comment on those specifically. But obviously, there was a government report [DATE] that indicated that poverty in [DATE] fell faster in [DATE] than in [DATE] since [DATE]. I think it might be [CARDINAL] indication that the anti-poverty economic strategy that President [PERSON] has pursued worked pretty well. And that is true when you consider how significantly poverty has been reduced over [DATE]. It is also true when you consider how significantly wages for working people have gone up -- the highest on record that same report showed. And wage growth was actually higher for lower- and middle-income families than it was for those at the top. So it is not just that we are reducing poverty; we are actually making some progress in reducing inequality as well. I think it is a pretty good indication that the kind of strategy that we have implemented has worked. And if [NORP] want to implement a new strategy, we will see what impact it has. This sort of goes back to what I was saying to [PERSON]. If [NORP] want to try a different approach, we will have an opportunity to see if it works. We will have an opportunity to see -- if by making some of these changes [NORP] can further reduce the poverty rate beyond the historic success that we have had in reducing the poverty rate, we will have an opportunity to tell. I am skeptical that they will succeed in doing that, but the [NORP] people have given them the opportunity to try. By the measure of success you are saying that it is gone better under the President's program and the poverty rate is not rising at a faster rate -- certainly slower rate than it has in [DATE]. And I just wanted to throw a couple numbers at you. [ORG] apparently serves [CARDINAL] people at the cost of [MONEY]. Those are [DATE] numbers, but that is up significantly since [DATE]. So I am just curious if it is going better -- based on your own assessment -- is it now a good time to maybe take a fresh look at programs like these? Well, the President actually in his -- back in [DATE], the President delivered his State of the Union address to a joint session of [ORG], and [CARDINAL] area that he identified in that speech was an opportunity to work in bipartisan fashion with [NORP] and [NORP] on a proposal that Speaker [PERSON] himself had long advocated, and that was essentially the expansion of tax cuts for low-income workers that do not have kids. Unfortunately, the Speaker of the [ORG] did not take him up on that opportunity for cooperation. So I am not suggesting that somehow there are not further improvements that could be made. In fact, President [PERSON] has offered his support for some of the ideas that [NORP] have put forward to do that. I do not think that [ORG] falls in that category, but I cannot speak at length about the proposal just because I have not seen it. But there certainly are areas where President [PERSON] would -- has already indicated his strong support for some of these proposals that he believes would have a beneficial impact on the economy and would further reduce inequality in this country. [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED1], I want to ask a couple of questions. First -- and I want to go back to the [PERSON] thing and the phone calls -- how many times has President [PERSON] spoken by phone with President-elect [PERSON]? We played this game a couple times over [DATE] -- It is not a game, I am asking a real question, though. I did not say it was not a real question. What I am telling you is I am not going to get into the details of reading out individual phone calls. So they have spoken several times since their face-to-face [FAC] meeting just after the election, but I do not have a specific number to give you. Okay, well, it is more than twice. We know that. Maybe [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] now? I think he said a handful last time. So I did say a handful last time. I am saying several this time. [CARDINAL] handfuls? I am being intentionally ambiguous. We know it is [CARDINAL] times. Maybe [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL]? [DATE], I would suggest that maybe we pursue a more fruitful line of questioning, respectfully. Respectfully. All right, well, now, on [PERSON] and his comments [TIME] about how President [PERSON] is a likable sort -- if, indeed, these [CARDINAL] would have talked, do you believe -- earlier -- that some of this division, some of these, the thought process and some of the words may not have been used to cause the divide that continues right now in this nation? Do you believe if they had talked prior to the elections that we would not be seeing the efforts to come together because of the comments that were made? Listen, it is difficult to answer counterfactuals because nobody really knows. I think the [CARDINAL] thing we do know is that [NORP] laid out a very clear strategy on [DATE] that President [PERSON] was inaugurated the very first time, which is to block and obstruct every single thing that he tried to do and to, as much as they could, to try to delegitimize his presidency. That was the strategy that was pursued by [NORP], and they did not succeed in limiting President [PERSON] to [CARDINAL] term. In fact, President [PERSON] was not just elected once, but twice, with a strong majority of the [NORP] electorate. And that gave him a mandate to go and pursue an agenda that has benefited the [NORP] people. And that is everything from strengthening our economy, preventing a second Great Depression, rescuing the [NORP] auto industry, to reforming our health care system in a way that ensures every [NORP] has access to quality, affordable health insurance and cannot be discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition. It also gave him a mandate to go and advance our interests around the world, to prevent [GPE] from obtaining a nuclear weapon by working through diplomacy and not firing a single shot, but actually confronting what most people, including some of our closest allies, had identified as the greatest national security threat that the world was facing. I could obviously go on at some length, and I will stop. But the fact is President [PERSON] has repeatedly sought to work with [NORP], but that ran counter to the political strategy that [NORP] laid out to try to block him at every turn and to refuse to cooperate with him even on things they supported. And the country did not benefit from that. But this was a political strategy that has yielded some political benefits for [NORP]. And a lot of that is what led to the election of Mr. [PERSON]. But that will be something for historians and others to carefully consider. What I think the President's hope is that what all of you consider as you report on the next administration is to evaluate what impact their changes are having, particularly when you consider the strong trajectory that the country currently enjoys. On your thoughts about [PERSON] in [FAC]? Listen, there are a number of [NORP] that have accepted an invitation from the President-elect to meet with him, and it certainly makes sense that the mayor of the third-largest city in the country might want to have a conversation with the President of [GPE]. And lastly, going back to what [PERSON] said about -- more so about the area and what happened -- [GPE], [GPE] area. It was in the news [DATE]. It caused a lot of change in the mind and in the heart and on so many levels -- President [PERSON], [DATE] after what happened to [PERSON], President [PERSON] was there. He preached a sermon for the [CARDINAL] that died in [ORG] church. And now [PERSON] is -- the jury has been seated in this trial. What does the President say, looking back [DATE] to [DATE], after what happened? And I understand that you cannot say much on the issue that is going to the federal piece. But what does he say about the area and how it made a mark in this nation from that time to [DATE]? Well, listen, I cannot talk about the individual cases for the reasons that you cited, but I think both of these cases, just gauging by the news media interest, have captured the attention of people all across the country. And I think all of this debate and examination can sometimes be painful, but ultimately that is the kind of examination and debate that will be required to move the country forward. And the President gave a powerful speech -- a sermon at a memorial service in [GPE] [DATE], and that certainly captured the attention of the [NORP] people as well. And to the extent that the President was able to contribute to a healthy examination of some of these issues and a healthy debate and discussion and dialogue in this country, he is pleased with that. [CARDINAL] example, [CARDINAL] manifestation of that is the way that a lot of people reconsidered their view of the confederate flag in light of these issues, in terms of what it symbolizes. That was a healthy thing for that country. But this is going to be part of process. And there is not just going to be [CARDINAL] event, or [CARDINAL] landmark jury decision, or [CARDINAL] heart-wrenching tragedy that is going to solve all these problems. This is going to be a process. And it is going to be a process that the President hopes the country can pursue together -- that the more that we can remember that the differences that unite are more powerful and more influential and more numerous than the things that divide us, that will certainly benefit us as we make our way down this path. And the last question. You say it is going to be a process, and as we go through this transition, I am thinking about that process that you said and what the President said in that sermon that he delivered for Reverend [PERSON]. He talked about amazing grace, and he kept talking about grace. Is it about grace, or is it more so about heart, or is it about legislation as we deal with the newness of life for [DATE]? Listen, I think more grace in our public discourse in every area, not just when it comes to national politics, I think is something that the entire country and all of our citizens would benefit from. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED1]. Going back to [PERSON] at [FAC] [DATE], we know that he urged the President-elect not to deport DREAMers -- of course, [CARDINAL] of young people -- or people who were brought here as children who were covered under the President's DACA program. Even in [TIME], there have been some [NORP] and [NORP] on [ORG] who said they were encouraged by the President-elect's remarks, and people -- I think he said that we have to look at this and take a look at something that will work and that the [NORP] people would be proud, according to his words. So is [ORG] -- [ORG] -- encouraged by those words as well? Well, listen, the President has been crystal-clear, both in words and in deeds, about his view that young people who are [NORP] in every way but their papers should not be deported, should not be ripped away from family members, when the truth is that they came to [GPE] through no fault of their own. A policy of deporting them would be inconsistent with our values and one that would be a setback for the country, particularly when you consider the remarkable contribution that many of those young people have already made to our country, whether it is by starting a business, or signing up to serve in our military, or otherwise living as upstanding members of communities all across the country. So I cannot speak to what policy the next administration intends to pursue. I think the perspective and values that I have just given voice to are the kinds of values that enjoy strong bipartisan support not just in [GPE] and not just in [ORG] but all across the country. And hopefully [NORP] and [NORP] will be able to find a way to deal with this situation in a way that is consistent with our values, in a way that is consistent with our laws. And if they do, the country stands to benefit not just from a national security perspective, not just from a quality of life perspective, but also from an economic perspective as well. I am sure you would agree, there are a number of people -- undocumented immigrants and people who are covered under the President's executive actions who want to know what is [ORG] doing? You say you do not know what the next one is going to do, but we want to know what is [ORG] doing to have an impact and maybe even change some minds or policies from the incoming President? Well, the thing that we certainly have done is we have taken quite seriously the transition process to ensure that the incoming administration understands Well, the thing that we certainly have done is we have taken quite seriously the transition process to ensure that the incoming administration understands what policies we have pursued and why we have pursued them, and what impact it has had across the country. But ultimately, the next President will take office on [DATE]. And his policies that will be implemented. Finally, can you confirm a report that the First Lady held a good-bye party for [ORG] staff and brought everyone to tears at a local pizza restaurant? I know there is a lot of good-byes happening over [DATE], or [DATE] left. Can you confirm that? And were staff -- were they moved to tears? Were you [CARDINAL] of them? I was on the President's trip to [GPE] [DATE], so I did not participate in an event like that. But let me see if I can get you some more information about it, okay? Thank you, [INTERVIEWED1]. Is it still the position of this administration that [PERSON] must go? I know the President said that [DATE]. But does that stand? That continues to be the policy of the administration. And again, it is not just because he stands in the way of a solution -- a diplomatic solution, although he does. And it is not just that we are so offended morally by his willingness to use the military might of his country against innocent civilians. There is also a practical consideration, which is that he has waged war on a substantial number of citizens in his country; his country has been torn apart; he has made it clear that he is unable to lead that country. And in order for us to find the kind of political solution that will bring that violence and chaos to an end, he cannot continue to serve as President of that country. And that is been our policy for [DATE]. And it continues to be our policy [DATE]. In the statement [DATE], the [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] countries said that there must not be impunity for those responsible. Is that statement specific to [PERSON]? And do you believe that he should face war crime challenges for what he is done? That statement is an indication that there must be accountability, particularly with regard to the kinds of depraved tactics that have been used by the regime against innocent civilians. Accountability in these situations is necessary and consistent with our values as a country. Let me ask you about the [ORG] that is being formed -- not specifically about specific picks, but the fact that there seem to be a large number of generals who have been chosen or who are being interviewed -- [ORG], [ORG], now [ORG], and potentially [ORG]. Does [ORG] have any thoughts about the fact that [PERSON] seems to be potentially choosing a [ORG] that is very heavy on retired military? No, just because I do not want to be in a position of criticizing or being -- even appearing to criticize decisions being made by the President-elect. What I will say is that the President spoke as recently as [DATE] about the values and leadership qualities that are exhibited by the men and women of the [GPE] military. And many of the people that President-elect [PERSON] has put forward are people that have served this country in the military with distinction. And that is -- even where political differences exist, that service and that commitment to sacrificing for the country are worthy of respect. The President certainly has exhibited that respect. I certainly tried to exhibit that respect. But ultimately, what qualifications and criteria the President-elect wants to use in choosing his [ORG] is something that I will let him decide. Secretary [PERSON] is going to be on [ORG] for the unveiling of [PERSON] portrait [DATE]. Is there any chance that President [PERSON] will meet her, speak to her [DATE]? I am not aware that they will meet, but we will keep you posted. I do not think I can commit at this point to announcing that meeting if it does occur. But let me see if I can get you guidance. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED1]. [PERSON]. Thanks a lot, [INTERVIEWED1]. Since the presidential election [DATE], the President has nominated numerous individuals to government boards such as [ORG], [ORG], [ORG]. Is it the President's expectation that the lame duck [ORG] will take up these nomination up or down? Well, [PERSON], I actually do not know to what extent the individuals that you have named actually require [ORG] confirmation. But we can certainly have somebody take a look at that for you. Is there an agreement with the [ORG] Majority Leader that the lame duck [ORG] will take up various nominations that require [ORG] confirmation? I do not know what sort of agreements, if any, have been reached with [ORG] [NORP]. We had discussed the benefits of, in a sense, living above the store for the President, the immediacy to a crisis situation where he can meet in [FAC] with his Joint Chiefs, his security team, members of [ORG], et cetera. And the fact that [PERSON] has been choosing to stay -- at least for now -- at [FAC], and possibly maybe the first bi-city President, so to speak -- what in a sense -- now that we have a price tag, it is literally costing the [NORP] taxpayer and the [GPE] taxpayer [MONEY] a day to keep Mr. [PERSON] safe in the tower. Do you have any additional thoughts about that? I know you made a comment about wherever the President goes, his security team is close by. That is right. Look, over [DATE] I have been in a variety of situations, in a variety of settings where I have fielded questions about criticism from [NORP] with regard to the President's travel, and I am not going to give into the temptation to do the same thing to the President-elect. [PERSON], you had your hand up earlier. I will give you the last one if you still have a question. You bet I do. Okay. I wanted to ask you to clarify your answer earlier about the waiver for the [ORG] Secretary. Were you saying the President would not sign a waiver if it reached his desk, that he'd prefer it happen during the new administration? No, I think what I am saying is the short answer to your question is, no, I was not signaling an unwillingness on the part of the President to sign a bill containing such a waiver. I think the observation that I was making is that it seems odd that congressional [NORP] would be choosing to sneak a provision in a budget bill to expedite the confirmation of somebody who is a decorated [ORG] officer, somebody who has served Presidents in both parties, somebody who [NORP] and [NORP] have spoken warmly of. So I cannot really explain it. I am not indicating that the administration will refuse to cooperate with them. In fact, the principle that I was giving voice to earlier was the idea that Presidents should be given some latitude to choose the people that they want to have on their team. The President was not extended that courtesy consistently by [NORP] in the [ORG], but it is a principle that the President believes in not just since he is coming in the door, but on his way out the door. And it is one that we will -- that he believes in. So, hopefully -- did that clarify -- You are saying a standalone bill on the waiver is the way to go? Well, I guess I find it strange that [NORP] in [ORG] seem to be taking an unconventional step to avoid the straightforward consideration of this waiver purely on its merits and on the merits of General [PERSON]'s service to the country. So I think it is a question that I am raising that I think is worth asking. But it is one that only congressional [NORP] can answer. And I wanted to ask about what the President said [DATE], that it was the last time he was going to hear Hail to the Chief on the road. What does that tell us about travel [DATE]? Well, I think it is an indication that the President's travel [DATE] is likely to be limited, at least with respect to official events. The President does still intend to travel to [GPE] to spend time with his family there over [DATE]. All right? Thanks, everybody. We will see you [DATE].", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretaryjaycarney124", "text": "Thanks, [INTERVIEWED]. On immigration, [PERSON] was quoted in [GPE] as saying that there is a window [DATE] to get immigration overhaul done. And she says, We have a commitment from Speaker [PERSON], who is very frustrated with his caucus. Now, the Speaker's office has denied that there is a commitment. And in a tweet [DATE], [PERSON] herself said that this was lost in translation and that she actually meant that it was a commitment to trying. But I guess the question is -- a commitment to trying what and when? Speaker [PERSON], other [ORG] [NORP] leaders and leading [NORP] outside of [ORG] have all expressed deep interest in moving forward on immigration reform. And we have found those comments and that interest to be encouraging and indicative of some movement among [NORP] in the [ORG] towards support for comprehensive immigration reform. What the President has said and others have said is that the opportunity before us is something very rare and we ought to seize it here in [GPE], all of us. The [ORG] ought to follow the [ORG]'s lead and pass comprehensive immigration reform. In the [ORG], a comprehensive bill passed with [NORP] and [NORP] support. [NORP] across the country, business leaders across the country, faith leaders and law enforcement leaders across the country are behind this effort. They recognize that passing comprehensive immigration reform will provide a huge boost to our economy, to our security, to principles of fairness. And for those reasons we ought to move forward, and what we hope is that the [ORG] will move. And that is a message that [PERSON] was carrying and that we have all been carrying for some time now. Is the suggestion here that if does not happen by [DATE], or at [DATE] -- have an [DATE] recess -- that the President will take matters into his own hands, he has some authority to do some things -- that we do something beyond just tweaking the margins? Well, I am not going to speculate about the future. What we have always said will always remain true, which is comprehensive immigration reform requires action by [ORG]. The President is always interested in moving the ball forward on his agenda where he can, even if [ORG] refuses to act. But there are some things that require congressional action, and this is one of them. So the [ORG] acted in this [ORG], and has put a bill forward that enjoys broad bipartisan support across the country in communities and among interest groups that do not often get together behind the same priority. And we hope that Speaker [PERSON], Majority Leader [PERSON], Chairman [PERSON] and others hear all the voices of support, including traditional [NORP] voices, traditional conservative voices for comprehensive immigration reform and move forward with it. That is what [PERSON] was talking about. That is what the President has talked about and I have talked about and others. We should get this done for our economy. We should get this done for our security. We should get this done because it will allow us to innovate more here in this country in ways that will build our economy and create high-paying jobs in this country. So the opportunity is there for the taking, and we hope that the Speaker and other [NORP] leaders in the [ORG] avail themselves of the opportunity. A question on [GPE] -- reports [DATE] of [NORP] insurgents pulling out of buildings, government buildings in the city of [GPE]. And this is because steelworkers employed by [CARDINAL] of the wealthiest men in [GPE] are patrolling the streets with police officers. I am wondering, is that a welcome development at [FAC]? Or is there a concern that the government in [GPE] is relying on oligarchs to essentially run the government in these tense regions? Well, I am not sure that is how I would interpret the story that you are referring to. We certainly welcome any indication that separatists that have seized buildings, who have set up roadblocks, stockpiled weapons, are vacating buildings and ceasing the kinds of activities that have only destabilized the situation in [GPE] and led to confrontations and violence. So that would certainly be a good development. And the fact that significant portions of the population in [GPE], including in eastern [GPE], do not support the agenda of [NORP]-backed separatists but support a united [GPE] and support a process by which decisions around constitutional reform and devolution of power from the center are made in an appropriate way -- that is a good thing. These are the kinds of issues that the [NORP] government in [GPE] has promised will be discussed in dialogue with [NORP] from all parts of the country at roundtables that are facilitated by the [ORG]. That is a good thing. And all of this comes as we move closer now to a presidential election on [DATE]. And our focus and the focus of the [ORG] and the [NORP] government and all of our partners in this effort is on ensuring that those elections are able to go forward. And the [ORG] has reported that the preparations, the technical preparations for the elections are proceeding well. Separatists have disrupted preparations in some isolated areas of [GPE] and [GPE], but in the vast majority of the country, as you know, [PERSON], the situation is calm and preparations are on track. And that is certainly a good thing and a welcome development. [INTERVIEWED], [ORG] was assessed a [MONEY] fine [DATE] over its ignition switch issues. Does the President believe that fine is enough? I have not discussed it with him. I would refer you to obviously the agency involved here, [ORG] and [ORG] -- [ORG], whatever that acronym stands for. But they are the bodies that you should address questions about it to. Has he been following that issue? Well, he is certainly broadly been following it. It is been an issue that is received a lot of attention, understandably. But in terms of that process, that is not something that I would have a lot to say about. [CARDINAL] quick foreign policy questions. You have talked a lot about the issue with [GPE] and [GPE], and wanting that to be resolved in a way that is diplomatic and without provocation. Do you want [GPE] to move the oil tanker? Here is what I'd say about that -- and I appreciate the question. First of all, we are closely following, out of our mission to [GPE], the protests in [GPE] around this issue. But regarding the broader issue of [GPE]'s unilateral decision to introduce an oil rig accompanied by numerous government vessels for the first time in waters disputed with [GPE], we would say what we have said repeatedly, which is this is a provocative act and it raises tensions in the region, and by raising tensions makes it more difficult to resolve claims over disputed territory in a manner that supports peace and stability in the region. So we consider that act provocative and we consider it one that undermines the goal that we share, which is a peaceful resolution of these disputes and general stability in the region. We are very concerned about dangerous conduct and intimidation by government-controlled assets operating in this area. And we call on all parties to conduct themselves in a safe and professional manner to preserve freedom of navigation and overflight, to exercise restraint, to take steps to lower tensions, and to address competing sovereignty claims peacefully and in accordance with international law. As you know, sovereignty over these islands, the Paracel Islands, is disputed. This is occurring in waters claimed by both [GPE] and [GPE] near those islands. These events highlight the need for claimants to clarify their claims in accordance with international law and to reach agreement on appropriate behavior and activities in disputed areas. As I have said before, [GPE] does not take a position on these competing sovereignty claims, but we do take a position on the conduct of the claimants who must resolve their disputes peacefully, without intimidation, without coercion, and in accordance with international law. Thank you. And [CARDINAL] last foreign policy question. Do you have a reaction to the election in [GPE]? I do. First of all, we congratulate [GPE] and the people of [GPE] on an historic national election, which saw more voters cast their ballots freely and fairly than in any election in human history. We congratulate [PERSON] and the [ORG] on winning a majority of seats in this historic election. Once the government is formed, we look forward to working closely with the Prime Minister and the [ORG] to advance our strong bilateral relationship based on shared democratic values. We would also like to thank Prime Minister [PERSON] for the role he played in transforming our strategic partnership during [DATE] in office. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED]. Mr. [PERSON] was banned the [GPE] visa for [DATE]. Do you think that was a step which could not have been taken -- was not the right step in the direction at the time? I am sorry, the question -- I understand about the visa, but what is the question? Do you think that was a wrong step taken by the previous administration, or do you stand by that? Well, I would refer you to [ORG] for general answers to questions about the issuance of visas. I can tell you that the Prime Minister of [GPE] will be welcomed to [GPE]. And I would also note that [GPE] officials, including Ambassador [PERSON], have met with Mr. [PERSON] so he is certainly not unknown to us. And does the President have any plans to call him? The President does plan to reach out to Mr. [PERSON], and I am sure we will let you know when that is happened. Just a follow-up, quickly? Yes, [PERSON]. [CARDINAL] -- if the President preparing to invite Prime Minister [PERSON] to [FAC]. And second, if you can confirm if the President has received a farewell letter from outgoing Prime Minister [PERSON] -- Dr. [PERSON]. I do not have anything on any correspondence the President may have received, and I think it is a little early to talk about a visit. The President will be reaching out to Mr. [PERSON] and, as I noted, we congratulate him and the [ORG] on winning a majority of seats in these historic elections. So, again, this is an important relationship, a strong, bilateral partnership, and the President looks forward to building on the progress we have made with Prime Minister [PERSON] in our relationship, in our bilateral relationship with the next Prime Minister. And finally, the entire President's administration, [DATE], Mr. [PERSON] was banned from coming to the [GPE] -- because there were several occasions when he was going to attend several functions in the [GPE] Do you think there is a bitterness there between the [CARDINAL] countries because of this? And now there is a landslide victory by the [ORG] and Mr. [PERSON], and the sweep-out of the outgoing government. What is the future of the [GPE] relationship? I think the future is bright. We have long said that we look forward to working with whomever the [NORP] people choose in these elections. And the [GPE] partnership enjoys broad support across party lines in both of our countries. And I am confident that we will continue our successful and productive partnership with the new [NORP] government. The President looks forward to speaking with Mr. [PERSON] and to working with the new government once it is formed. Let me move on. A follow-up on that? Let me get to -- I promise I will get to you. [INTERVIEWED], a follow-up on the immigration question. I am just wondering where [ORG] stands now on the issue in what is acceptable and what is not. Is it essential still to [ORG] that whatever finally emerges from [ORG] include a path to citizenship? That is the President's position. It is elemental to the principles that he put forward. It is reflected in the bipartisan bill that passed the [ORG]. And the President strongly believes that it needs to be a part of comprehensive immigration reform. We have long said that the [ORG] would necessarily pursue its own path in the construction of an immigration reform package, but comprehensive immigration reform is essential because the whole works together in a way that achieves all of the important benefits to the economy and to the country that we are looking for with the passage of this legislation. So I am not going to get into a lot of parsing of what ifs because we have not seen a thing out of the [ORG] yet, and we are looking forward to the [ORG] acting on the urges we have heard expressed and the interest and desire that we have heard expressed by [NORP], including [NORP] leaders on this matter. And we want to see comprehensive immigration reform. We want to see comprehensive immigration reform that meets the test set by the President when he laid out his principles [DATE]. And those principles are reflected in the [ORG] bill, as I have said many times. That bill does not exactly mirror what the President would have written if he were to write a bill and see it pass through [ORG], and he does not expect that what emerges from the [ORG], if the [ORG] has the courage to act on this, to match word for word what he would prefer. But what he does insist is that comprehensive immigration reform adhere to the principles he laid out in the beginning. So whatever the legislative process, not parsing that, the final bill that he would sign into law must include a path to citizenship? I just want to be -- We have said all along that comprehensive immigration reform needs to include a path to citizenship. And he will not sign a law that is short of that? Not sign a law -- there are just so many different -- He will not sign a bill that does not include a path to citizenship -- that is my question. He signs a lot of bills that do not include paths to citizenship. You know what I mean. I know what you mean, too, but what I am not going to do is -- So you are saying -- so he is open to signing an immigration bill that falls short of a path to citizenship? Is that still -- His position, unlike the position of others, has been absolutely consistent from beginning to end -- or to this point. Unfortunately, we are not at the end yet, and I do not expect it to change. Okay. And then on the [ORG], I have heard you and I have heard others at [ORG] talk about the [ORG] as having a good record on dealing with the backlog of claims and actually praising the [ORG] on this issue. In light of the way this -- as we learn more about problems and not just in the [GPE] office, but in other parts of the country, are you still saying you think that [ORG] has done a good job in dealing with the backlog of claims? I mean, are you still going to say that? I appreciate the question, [INTERVIEWER], and I think it is important to note -- and I tried to [DATE] when this came up -- you are conflating [CARDINAL] separate things. The disability claims, the backlog and disability claims -- this is a specific problem and challenge that the [ORG] and [ORG] and others in the administration have been aggressively attacking. And that is where you have seen a [PERCENT] reduction in the size of the backlog [DATE] over [DATE], from this point to [DATE]. And that has been important progress. And the size of that backlog increased significantly when this administration, because our veterans deserve it, made the decision that there would be a presumption of acceptance of a claim if you were a veteran claiming problems associated with exposure to Agent Orange. That is the first time that is ever been done; that is what this administration did. If you were a veteran of the first Gulf War and you felt that you were a victim of problems associated with exposure in that war, and if you were a veteran of [GPE] or [GPE] and you experience Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, again, your claim would clear a hurdle automatically under this process that we established in this administration because we believe our veterans deserve it. That immediately increased the population of people who had disability claims added to the backlog, and that backlog has been a focus of intense work and attention by the [ORG] and the administration in general. On the matter of the absolute requirement that our veterans get the health care and services that they deserve and they get that in a timely fashion, the revelations or at least the allegations that have emerged from the situation in [GPE] I think have been greeted, in terms of reaction in the manner that Secretary [PERSON] suggested [DATE], with a great deal of anger and frustration. And if they prove to be true, people will be held accountable. But these are matters -- and other issues that have been discussed in the wake of those allegations -- that are properly under review at the order of Secretary [PERSON], under investigation at the recommendation of Secretary [PERSON] by the independent inspector general. And as you know, the President and Chief of Staff here have responded to Secretary [PERSON]'s recommendation by sending [CARDINAL] of the President's most trusted aides over to [ORG] to help with that review, to work with Secretary [PERSON] on that review. So I think that reflects the seriousness with which we approach this matter, our concern about some of the allegations that have been made. But I just wanted to make sure that it was understood that there is a -- that the disability claims issue is not the same issue that is being discussed when we talk about the allegations in [GPE]. I think part of the confusion is when you and others have been asked about the problems in terms of veterans getting the health care that they need and deserve, you have answered with talking points on the disability claim backlog. So are you really -- I mean, are you suggesting that this is a problem that is limited to the [GPE] office? I think that there is an active review, as well as an investigation by the IG that will determine both what happened in [GPE] and, I am sure, what happened elsewhere if some of the other allegations that we have seen merit investigation. What I have been saying is that under Secretary [PERSON]'s leadership there has been a firm dedication to providing the kind of services that our veterans deserve. It is reflected in some of the decisions that were made to increase access to disability claims and to health care. We have under his leadership reduced veterans homelessness by [PERCENT]. We have provided Post-9/11 GI Bill educational benefits to [CARDINAL] students. And we have decreased the disability claims. My point is that when I talk about the progress that has been made, I have been referring to questions about Secretary [PERSON] and his leadership of [ORG], and that progress has come on his watch and he certainly deserves credit for it. Do you think it sounds strange, though, that given the evidence that we are seeing coming out and suggestions that veterans have actually died waiting to get health services -- I think the word you used is essential because you said the suggestion. And this matter is under investigation -- I would point you to what the IG said [DATE]. But here you are praising the [ORG] for all the things that have been done under [PERSON]'s leadership. There seems to be a -- Let me just explain the way you just asked that question. You are saying there is a suggestion that something terrible happened in [GPE] -- and that is under investigation. All we know is that it is a suggestion. But you do not think there is evidence that there has been a real problem with the quality of health care that our veterans are getting? You do not think that this is going to be -- we still need to study this further? You do not think there is enough to act on right now to say that our veterans are not getting the care that they need? We are acting on the allegations and the suggestions that you pointed out, and I would point you to what the IG said [DATE] about his ongoing investigation into the -- -- you are going to investigate more? You are saying we should not ? We should just accept allegations as true without investigating them? I do not think that would be a normal procedure. Meanwhile, we are moving aggressively in a host of areas to ensure that our veterans are getting the services and the care that they deserve. And that is reflected not least in the fact that the President has requested increases in the budget for the [ORG] [DATE] he has been in office in a time of very tight budgets. And he has insisted when it came to the serious matter of the disability backlog that we attack that problem with aggression and with substantial resources, and that is resulted in the reduction in the backlog. And that reduction needs to be eliminated -- I mean, the backlog has been reduced, but it needs to be eliminated, and that is an important part of making sure that our veterans are being taken care of. Let me move around a little bit. To follow-up on what [INTERVIEWER] was asking, if General [PERSON] is mad as hell about what went on, why is it the [ORG] position that it is just allegations and suggestions? It seems to me he has made a conclusion in his mind that something bad happened. I think I would refer you to his testimony. The fact is, if what has been alleged is true, that would be an outrage. And that is an opinion shared by the President, by Secretary [PERSON], and I think everyone else who has looked at this matter and works on these issues. Why has not he expressed it? The President was asked about the allegations and answered forthrightly and expressed his concern about it. The actions that we have taken reflect the concern that we have about it. And the fact that he has sent [CARDINAL] of his most trusted and top aides from [ORG] over to the [ORG] to assist the Secretary in his review reflects the seriousness with which we take this matter. But, again, I would simply say that it stands to reason that when allegations are made, it is important that they are investigated to find out the truth behind the matter before we just assume that what happened or what is said to have happened is true. I am not in any way prejudging, because I do not think we ought to prejudge. I do think that it is a matter of enough concern that the actions that Secretary [PERSON] has taken and the actions that the President and [ORG] have taken are merited, and we will continue to aggressively tackle this problem. Should the [NORP] people be able to trust -- the President says he is -- you said the President is sending over [CARDINAL] of his most trusted aides to oversee this. Wasn't General [PERSON] [CARDINAL] of his most trusted aides? Why should the [NORP] public look at that and say, well, that is the right thing to do instead of bringing somebody in from the outside perhaps to look at what is going on at the [ORG]? [INTERVIEWER], what I can tell you is the President has confidence in Secretary [PERSON], someone with an incredibly admirable record in the military and in service to our veterans. And, again, under Secretary [PERSON] there has been significant progress. There remains a lot of work to do when it comes to making sure that our veterans get the services and care that they deserve, but Secretary [PERSON] is aggressively tackling the challenges that we face on these matters. And when we see revelations like or accusations like what we have seen with regards to the office in [GPE], it was certainly our view when Secretary [PERSON] suggested it to our Chief of Staff that it was the right thing to do to add capacity, if you will, in order to make the effort more intense and more rapid to Secretary [PERSON]'s team by sending [PERSON] over to the [ORG]. [INTERVIEWED], on that point about the President speaking out -- [DATE], for the second time [DATE] alone, he talked about transportation funding, infrastructure funding because it is a priority for him. If fixing this [ORG] problem is a priority for him, why have we not heard from him since [DATE]? A lot has happened since he spoke out at that news conference. Right, a lot has happened. There have been allegations. The [ORG] administration has responded to those allegations by launching a review and suggesting and recommending and soliciting that the independent [ORG] investigate. The President has asked his Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, one of his most trusted advisors, to temporarily take an assignment over at the [ORG] to assist Secretary [PERSON] in that effort. And Secretary [PERSON], as you know, was testifying on [ORG] [DATE] about this. This is something that, again, the President cares deeply about when it comes to our veterans and ensuring that we provide for them in a way that honors the service they provided us. Why is he not speaking directly to veterans on this and saying, this is how much it matters and we are going to fix it? Your words are important, but if you are -- on transportation funding, for example, he does not just have you do it; he gets out there and says, [ORG] has to move on this. Why is he not out directing veterans on this? Well, again, he is taking action, [PERSON]. He has responded to this. He has spoken about it. I am sure there will be an opportunity for him to speak about it again. I think you would be the first to say that if -- and maybe you would, since [ORG] is not acting yet on transportation -- that speaking alone does not get the job done; acting gets the job done. When it comes to transportation -- Sure, but you push them along. But he pushes them along. He does not give up if [ORG] has not done. If I may, [PERSON], when it comes to transportation funding, that requires action by [ORG] so to ensure that [CARDINAL] of [NORP] are not thrown off the job come [DATE]. When it comes to taking the actions that we have taken as an administration in response to allegations, that is something we can do and that is something that the President is directing. How do you react directly to [ORG] Majority Leader [PERSON]? He put out a statement [DATE] saying he believes there is a pattern at [ORG] where the Cabinet Secretaries take all the heat and the President ultimately is just not held accountable. Well, I would say that this briefing suggests otherwise. I would say -- It is you, it is not the President. A briefing is not -- the point is that the Cabinet Secretaries -- I think that in the time that since those allegations emerged in the press, the President has given [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] press conferences, so I think he has had the opportunity to address this and has been asked about it. I think there will be other opportunities for him to address this. But what he has also done is acted on it and so has Secretary [PERSON]. Last one is -- you were talking about immigration earlier and that the clock is ticking, and minimum wage, a lot of other important priorities that the President has been pushing -- transportation funding as well. Is there any fear at all with [ORG] having hearings, that [ORG] is having an investigation, there was talk [DATE] that the [ORG] may get involved because there may be criminal charges in the [ORG] scandal if, in fact, people did die because of this. My question being is there any fear that this is a big -- I struggle to use the word distraction because it is an important issue that veterans get their health care, but is this something that overshadows the attention of [ORG] right now so you cannot get immigration and other stuff done? I would simply say that it is an important matter and that the resources necessary to tackle it so that we are providing the services and benefits that veterans deserve are merited, and the attention that is paid to it by those who are concerned about the problem as opposed to politics is absolutely appropriate. That is how the President views it. Does the government have any confidence, this administration have any confidence that the [NORP] can ever retrieve the young women, particularly in light of [DATE]'s news that President [PERSON] was supposed to go to the village from which they were kidnapped and decided at [TIME] not to go? Well, I would say that, first of all, a couple of things. There is no question that the [NORP] people, the [NORP] face a real threat in [ORG]. [ORG] has demonstrated it has no regard for human life and it has demonstrated an increased ability to conduct attacks, and those attacks have increased in frequency and lethality. So this organization poses a serious threat in that country. When it comes to the efforts undertaken by the [NORP] government to find these girls, we have made clear that, in our view, time is of the essence and that we can and are assisting the [NORP] government in the search, but the [NORP] government has the lead and needs to act accordingly. Now, we are -- But they do not seem to be making any progress. You mean the girls have not been found? I mean, I think what we -- I think the -- No, signs from [GPE] are not encouraging. Well, I think a circumstance -- I mean, I think that it was important -- and I tried to do this when we first started talking about the assistance [GPE] was going to provide -- to understand that despite the expertise we have, the capacities we have, and the kind of assets that we can bring to bear in this, that this is a tremendous challenge. We are talking about [CARDINAL] people who are being searched for in an area at least the size of [GPE], portions of which are very densely forested, as I understand it. So this is a difficult challenge. And, again, this is a population of kidnapped girls that we hope remains intact and together, but obviously if they have been separated that makes the challenge even greater -- which does not mean that we will not provide all the assistance and assets that we can in that effort in helping [GPE] conduct this search, but it is certainly a challenge. But the security situation is apparently so bad that the President of the country cancelled a visit to the area [DATE]. Is that a question? I think the fact that the security situation, because of [ORG], is real is one that is self-evident and which I discussed [TIME] ago. But that does not mean that we cannot and that they cannot conduct a search, and that is certainly what is happening. We have already, as I discussed [DATE], launched both manned and unmanned aircraft as part of the reconnaissance effort, and we have a team of personnel assisting the [NORP] government in a variety of ways. Other nations have lent their support to the effort and we hope that it will bear fruit and we will find the girls. [INTERVIEWED], has President [PERSON] spoken to President [PERSON], or does he plan to? I do not have any conversations to read out. Did he have a reaction to canceling his trip? I have not spoken to him about it. And [NORP] officials, [GPE] officials, officials from [GPE] and [GPE] are going to meet over [DATE] and discuss their strategy moving forward. What is the anticipation on the part of [ORG] about the tangibles that might come out of that meeting -- the series of meetings? I think that we are focused on assisting the [NORP] in developing a concrete plan and a concrete approach to finding out where the girls are and recovering them so that they can be returned to their families. And that requires coordination and it requires strategy. And I assume that these conversations will be focused on that effort. Going back to [INTERVIEWER]'s line of questioning, you have [PERSON], who is the Director of African Affairs, talking about some of her frustrations, frustrations on the part of [GPE] with the [NORP] government's slow to adapt with new strategies and new tactics. Can you flesh out what some of the other frustrations are that the [GPE] feels in terms of working with the government of [GPE]? Well, look, I think that the challenge that [GPE] faces from this group is a serious one, and there are all sorts of issues that she and others have identified that make the challenge even greater and that we try to address as a friend of [GPE] in the assistance that we provide. That is why we provide security assistance, to increase [GPE]'s capacity to meet the threat, including by helping professionalize its military and helping it carry out responsible counterterrorism operations. It is why we provide law enforcement assistance, to help [GPE] bring those responsible for attacks on civilians to justice. It is why we support programs and initiatives that are aimed at combating violent extremist ideology, including by creating economic alternatives for those vulnerable to being recruited by terrorist organizations. So we have a coordinated effort that is designed to help strengthen [GPE]'s ability to respond responsibly and effectively to these challenges in a way that ensures civilians are protected and human rights are respected. And responding responsibly and effectively is important because that is , in effect, how you provide support for and reassurance to the population that is also having to deal with the threat posed by an organization like [ORG]. Just [CARDINAL] on [PERSON]. Is there a timeline for the review that he is conducting? Has the President said, I want you to -- For questions like that, I would refer you to the [ORG]. They are obviously conducting the review. So I do not have a timeline on [PERSON]'s stay over at the [ORG] except to say that it is temporary and he will be coming back and returning to his responsibilities as Deputy Chief of Staff here when that assignment is finished. [ORG] has repeatedly expressed confidence in [PERSON]'s leadership, progress under his watch. But the way that this all came out -- even if you are going to keep calling them all allegations and they seem to be more widespread than [CARDINAL] hospital -- does not that in itself indicate a major shortfall in his oversight and leadership of the administration? [PERSON], I think I have addressed this question. What we have seen in response to the allegations that have been reported is a review instigated by the Secretary, one that we are now providing a senior [ORG] official to assist -- My question is the way it came out, that this was all -- all of these problems that have been built up and widespread, it all came out through reporting by the press, that some of this was not even known about. So does not that, in and of itself, indicate a major shortfall there? Well, I'd say a couple of things about that. First of all, there are active reviews and investigations into what happened, and I think, again, I am not going to pass judgment on what happened until we have seen the conclusion of an investigation. And I think that is generally a wise approach to take. Separately, should some of these allegations prove to be true, Secretary [PERSON] has made clear that he would be outraged by that and angry by that -- the President certainly would be -- and he would expect people to be held accountable. That is why there is an investigation. That is why there is a review. On the role of the press, I think the press, in general -- and again, I am not going to pass judgment on whether or not the allegations are true because we do not know, but the role of the press is important in general as a -- on matters like this and in so many other areas. So I would not sell the press short when it comes to the important role they play. And on [GPE], these reports that have come out [DATE] that [GPE] is actively pursuing ballistic missiles, what is [ORG] view of that and the possibility of eventually reaching a nuclear deal? Well, on the question of ballistic missiles, we have made clear that all issues of concern are on the table during the [ORG]-plus-1 negotiations aimed at reaching a comprehensive agreement. And we are not going to get into details of specific items of negotiations because negotiating in public would not serve the goal here, but I would point you to the fact that the Joint Plan of Action lays out very clearly the elements for a comprehensive agreement and it talks about all concerns needing to be addressed, and it talks about making sure that we know that, in fact, this is an entirely peaceful program. It also talks about [ORG] resolutions needing to be addressed, including provisions relating to ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead. So ballistic missiles fall into the topics under discussion that would need to be part of a comprehensive resolution of this dispute and this challenge. So that is the view we take. Without sort of teasing out any individual item and talking about how that concern would have to be addressed in the final product, what we will do is point you to those [ORG] resolutions, the fact that the Joint Plan of Action explicitly calls for those concerns to be resolved, and make clear that everything in the JPA is on the table and has to be resolved for a comprehensive agreement to be reached. [INTERVIEWED], I have [CARDINAL] questions. On the [GPE] elections, a statement that the Vice President put out [DATE] used the word, delegitimize in the statement, that [GPE] would face additional costs should it disrupt or delegitimize the election results. My question is a follow-up on a question earlier, which is who is the arbiter for the results of the election, whether they are disrupted or delegitimized, since sectoral sanctions would be so important to determine a range. Who decides that? Well, first of all, there will be international observers organized by the [ORG] who will be able to make judgments about the conduct of the election and any efforts to undermine the election or delegitimize it. [GPE] and the rest of our partners in the international community who have taken one side on this matter, and [GPE], which has taken another side, I think will make judgments about how the elections proceed. President [PERSON], back when he also said or suggested that the so-called referenda should not be held on [DATE], also said that the [DATE] election might be a good step. And we certainly agree with that -- not just might be, but a necessary and important step -- for the [NORP] people because it would -- successful implementation of that election would allow the [NORP] people to freely express their will when it comes to choosing their leader, their president. And we are very focused on ensuring, with our partners, that the election takes place. This is a small matter, but the President has a minor cold. I am not suggesting that he is ill, but here is the question -- I cannot find any public record that the President has had his full medical workup, his usual exam, since before the election. And maybe I missed it. Can you tell us, update us when -- I will have to take the question. I have not looked into that. Hey, [INTERVIEWED]. [DATE] the [ORG] voted to create what they call Internet fast lanes. I am wondering, the President, as candidate in [DATE], said he would oppose such efforts. Is the President disappointed by the [ORG] decision, or is he contemplating going back on his campaign promise from [DATE]? The President has made clear since he was a candidate, [INTERVIEWER], that he strongly supports net neutrality and an open Internet. As he has said, the Internet's incredible equality of data, content and access to the consumer is what has powered extraordinary economic growth and made it possible for once tiny sites like [ORG] and [ORG] to compete with brick-and-mortar operations. The [ORG] is an independent agency, as you know, and we will carefully review their proposal. The [ORG]'s efforts were dealt a real challenge by [ORG] in [DATE], but Chairman [PERSON] has said his goal is to preserve an open Internet, and we are pleased to see that he is keeping all options on the table. We will be watching closely as the process moves forward in hopes that the final rule stays true to the spirit of net neutrality. The President is looking at every way to protect a free and open Internet and we will -- and he will consider any option that might make sense. Does the rule that was passed [DATE] meet the President's standards for net neutrality? Again, I think the rule -- what was passed [DATE] was something that kept options on the table. And that is what -- That is not a yes or no, though. Well, if you have all options on the table, then the President will be looking very closely to see that the outcome of this results in a final rule that stays true to the spirit of net neutrality, which he supports. I have got a couple questions. [DATE], Secretary [PERSON] said on [ORG] that you might be looking at changes -- or the President might be looking at changes to the [ORG] program that is part of reforming the deportation policy. Does [ORG] have anything on that? I did not see that comment. What I think you know is that the President asked Secretary [PERSON] to address -- to review procedures when it comes to enforcement, and that review is underway. I would refer you to the department for any status update they might have. And also [DATE], there were some documents released to [ORG] through [ORG] -- a lawsuit -- that did appear that the [GPE] office of [ORG] did have more to do with targeting some of the tea party groups in this. Does that -- I did not see that report, so I do not have a response. Okay. Well, does [ORG] still believe that this was entirely out of the [GPE] office, as the President said during the Super Bowl interview? Our position has not changed and I certainly have not seen any facts that suggest otherwise. But I have not seen the report that you mentioned. [PERSON]. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED]. I am just curious about this sports concussion event. It will be a public event? Yes. And what is the President hoping to get out of it? Will there be a list of recommendations? We hope to see and expect to see some public and private commitments made towards the study of and education about this problem. I think the President, as a father who also has on his staff others who are parents, knows that this is a topic that a lot of families are discussing right now as more and more information is provided about the problems associated with concussions in sports, especially for our young. And we have the ability here, because it is [ORG] and because he is the President, to help elevate this issue and help draw attention to it and support for efforts to make progress on it so that we can ensure that our kids are being able to get all the benefits that come from participating in sports but are able to do so in as safe a way as possible. Was [PERSON] invited? Will he be attending? I do not have a list of attendees at this time. What I can tell you is we are not prepared to announce participants or commitments at this time, but the President recognizes that raising awareness of and better protecting children and student athletes from concussions, and better identifying and treating them when they do occur requires a team approach. And professional sports leagues, including the [ORG], are certainly vital members of that team. So this is an effort that a lot of people can be involved in and should be involved in. And this is something that is often talked about within the context of football. I have a son who is expressing interest in playing tackle football, so it is something that I am particularly interested in, but it does not limit itself just to football. Obviously we have seen a lot of reports about concussions in other sports, including soccer. So this is something that I think a lot of families spend a lot of time worrying about and want to know as much as they can about, and want to be sure that they are taking all the precautions they can on behalf of their children so their children can get all the great experiences that come from participating in sports. And last question on this. How does he prepare for an event like this? Is he reading books? There is been some good ones -- League of Denial. [ORG] has done some documentaries. I am curious about how he prepares for -- I know that it is something that he has addressed when asked a couple of times in interviews where he is noted that if he had a son he would have to think twice about saying yes to having him play football. There have been -- obviously the report that came out [DATE] that helped spark this conversation, and there is a lot of research that is been done within the government, including within the military, on some of these issues. So I do not have specific reading lists, but I know that it is a topic of conversation here just like it is around the country. I have [CARDINAL] follow-ups. The first one is the ambassador already has retired and is expected to leave during [DATE]. Who is going to be the top diplomat in [GPE]? You are sending somebody from here to start the dialogue? I do not have any personnel announcements to make. It is obviously a very important post, but when the President has an announcement to make he will make it. Are you sending somebody from here, [CARDINAL] of your diplomats, to start? Because if you see the baggage of [DATE] of visa denial, just a statement welcoming him may not bring him here. So will the [GPE] go beyond? You would have to speak to him about his views on this matter. First of all, I think we have made clear that we congratulate the [NORP] people and Mr. [PERSON] and his party on their victory. We await the formation of a government, and we absolutely look forward to continuing all the progress that we have made in our bilateral relationship, and fully expect to be able to do so. But just looking at the personal level, will it be kind of a hiccup, and if we are ready to do something to address that on a personal level? Again, the Prime Minister of [GPE] will receive a visa to travel to [GPE]. We look forward to working with the new government and the new Prime Minister, and we congratulate Mr. [PERSON] and his party on their victory. I do not anticipate any problem in that regard. What we do anticipate is moving forward with the new government and strengthening a relationship that has already been strengthened significantly over [DATE] with Prime Minister [PERSON] at the helm in [GPE]. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED]. Do you have any result on the President's call [DATE] to President [PERSON] regarding the mine disaster? I do not have a readout for you. When we do we will get it to you. [PERSON]. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED]. [DATE], Secretary [PERSON] said that he was open to a review of the military's ban on transgender servicemembers. I was wondering if the President would back that review and whether or not he is had any conversations with the [ORG] Secretary about that issue. Well, the President speaks with Secretary [PERSON] regularly, meets with him [DATE]. I do not have a readout on all his conversations, but I would certainly point you to what Secretary [PERSON] said and certainly we support his efforts in this area. And the President I do not think has ever spoken out on this issue before. Does he think that that ban should eventually be lifted? I would simply at this point leave it to Secretary [PERSON]'s comments. I have not spoken to him directly about this issue, but I would note what Secretary [PERSON] said and that we support him. Does [ORG] agree with [NORP] [ORG] General [PERSON] who said [DATE] that the Asia rebalance strategy has emboldened [GPE] in its territorial dispute with [GPE] in the South China Sea? No. I would simply say what I said earlier about the need for parties to these disputes to address them in a peaceful and diplomatic way, in keeping with international norms and international law. I would note what I said about the unilateral decision and provocative one when it came to the -- when it comes to the oil rig and our calling on all sides to restrain -- refrain from taking actions that inflame tensions, as opposed to actions that calm the situation and allow for peaceful dialogue about it and resolution about the dispute. [DATE] ahead? [DATE] ahead, [PERSON], you are right. [INTERVIEWED], before you give us [DATE] ahead, can you just -- You got breaking news on your device? No, no, this is not breaking news. Can you give us the President's reflections as we approach the 60th anniversary of [PERSON] v. [ORG]? He is obviously meeting with some of the family members of the plaintiffs [DATE]. And maybe tell us why that event is closed to press. It is a private meeting that the President is having with families. I would note that the First Lady will be speaking publicly about the anniversary of this landmark [ORG] decision [TIME] in [GPE], [GPE]. The President feels, as I think so many people do around the country, that this decision was historic, that it enabled [CARDINAL] of [NORP] to get a better education. There was a good story [TIME] about the First Lady and how that decision affected her life, which I think speaks to why it is so appropriate for her to be speaking on it [TIME]. We have more work to do, and that is why the President has the aggressive education agenda that he has. That is why he is focused on making pre-kindergarten education available to all in this country, because that early start is so essential for a child's future. So I think that we have come a long way in [DATE], and this is an important anniversary to note. But the President's views are that that is true and that also we need to keep moving forward when it comes to ensuring that we are doing everything we can to provide a quality education to all of our kids. Let me give you [DATE] ahead. On [DATE], the President will have lunch with combatant commanders. In [TIME], the President will attend a [ORG] event. On [DATE], the President will attend meetings here at [FAC]. On [DATE], the President will participate in an ambassador credentialing ceremony in [FAC]. At this event the President will receive the credentials from foreign ambassadors recently posted in [GPE]. The presentation of credentials is a traditional ceremony that marks the formal beginning of ambassador's service here. Afterward, the President will welcome the Super Bowl Champion [ORG] to [FAC] to honor the team and their Super Bowl victory. On [DATE], the President will travel to [GPE] to participate in [CARDINAL] events for the [ORG]. The President will remain in [GPE] [TIME]. On [DATE], he will return to [GPE] from [GPE]. And I would be remiss in noting -- in not noting as I leave here that [DATE] is [PERSON] last day, and we at [ORG] will all miss her wisdom and good humor. And we wish her well. Thanks, everybody.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsexitinterviewwithdoriskearnsgoodwin", "text": "Preparing for this conversation [DATE], I realized that it was [DATE] that you first called me on my cell phone: Hello, this is [INTERVIEWED1]. I have just read Team of Rivals and we have to talk about [PERSON]. Soon afterward, I came to see you in your [ORG] office. So what was it about him? What made you give your announcement speech in the shadow of [FAC]? What spoke to you about [PERSON] to make you say, I love this guy ? [INTERVIEWED1] Well, look, I am from [GPE], and I spent [DATE] down in [GPE]. So the location and the announcement, to some degree, made sense optically. My particular passion for [PERSON], though, dates back from my earliest memories of politics. And we have talked about this before-that there is no one who I believe has ever captured the soul of [GPE] more profoundly than [PERSON] has. Not just his biography, of somebody who genuinely rose from nothing, self-taught, striking out along the borders of our Great Frontier. Somebody who worked with his hands and then worked with his mind, and somehow became one of the greatest writers in the English language. And I think, most importantly, somebody who was able to see humanity clearly, see the fundamental contradictions of the [NORP] experiment clearly, and yet still remain hopeful and still remain full of humor, and still have a basic sympathy for the human condition, even in the midst of a terrible war and having to make terrible decisions. And having a forgiving spirit. I mean, I could go on and on for [TIME] about [PERSON]. For me, [PERSON] is like just a handful of people-a [PERSON], or a [PERSON], or [PERSON] an original and captures something essential. When [PERSON] was [DATE], and running for office the first time, he said, Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition. I have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow men, by rendering myself worthy of their esteem. And then, [DATE], when he was in the midst of a depression so severe that his friends took all the knives, razors, and other dangerous things from his room, he said he was more than willing to die but that he had done nothing to make any human being remember that he had lived. Is not that incredible? So how would you describe your peculiar ambition that every man has? And when did it develop? [INTERVIEWED1] It is always dangerous to amend the words of [PERSON], but let me see if this is a friendly amendment. I actually think, when you are young, ambitions are somewhat common-you want to prove yourself. It may grow out of different life experiences. You may want to prove that you are worthy of the admiration of the demanding father. You may want to prove that you are worthy of the love of an absent father. You may want to prove that you are worthy of other kids or neighbors who were wealthier than you and teased you. You may want to prove that you are worthy of high expectations. But I do think that there is a youthful ambition that very much has to do with making your mark in the world. And I think that cuts across the experiences of a lot of people who end up achieving something significant in their field. I think, as you get older, that is when your ambitions become peculiar ... Oh, well said, sir. We can amend [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED1] ... because I think that at a certain stage those early ambitions burn away, partly because you achieve something, you get something done, you get some notoriety. And then the particularities of who you are and what your deepest commitments are begin expressing themselves. You are not just chasing the idea of me being important, but you, rather, are chasing a particular passion. So, in my case, you could analyze me and say that my father leaving and being absent was a motivator for early ambition, trying to prove myself to this apparition who had vanished. You could argue that me being a mixed kid in a place where there were not a lot of black kids around might have spurred on my ambitions. You could go through a whole litany of things that sparked me wanting to do something important. But as I got older, then my particular ambitions started cohering around creating a world in which people of different races or backgrounds or faiths can recognize each other's humanity, or creating a world in which every kid, regardless of their background, can strive and achieve and fulfill their potential. And those particular ambitions end up being rooted not just in me wanting to prove myself, but they end up being rooted in a particular worldview, a recognition that the world only makes sense to me given my life and my background if, in fact, we are not just an assortment of tribes that can never understand each other, but that we are , rather, one common humanity that can meet and learn and love each other. And at some point politics becomes the channel for that, right? [INTERVIEWED1] Right. For example, young [PERSON] seemed a pretty ordinary guy. At [DATE] he is a clerk in a law firm. He has not done anything particularly great in college or law school. He gets his first chance to run for the state legislature, and somehow, when he is out there on the campaign trail, something clicks in. [PERSON] said, At such moments, there is a voice inside which speaks and says, 'This is the real me.' And [PERSON] knew then that is what he wanted to be. [INTERVIEWED1] I think [PERSON] is a great example of what I mean. If you look at his early life, it is ambition for ambition's sake ... Absolutely. [INTERVIEWED1] It is like he is just checking off boxes. There is no sense of what he wants to do with power; he wants power. There is no clarity about where he wants to take his notoriety; he just wants to be famous. And there is a hunger there, right? And that is partly because of [PERSON] ... [INTERVIEWED1] Absolutely. Because [PERSON]-his distant cousin and [PERSON] uncle-did this, so I am going to be this at [DATE], I am going to be this at [DATE]; I am going to be president. He says this at [DATE], but he does not have that inner ... [INTERVIEWED1] And some of it is his mom, right? Who is just been telling him from [DATE] ... You are the best. You are the center of the world. [INTERVIEWED1] You are the center of the world and all that. So there are all these things going on. And then he gets polio. And then suddenly there is this intersection between a personal crisis and what is beginning to happen in the country. And that thing in him that was great but untapped suddenly is released in a way that reflects compassion ... And empathy. [INTERVIEWED1] ... and empathy. And the innate optimism that early on might have been cockiness now is leavened with tragedy in a way that makes that optimism that much more profound, right? There is no question. Adversity in almost all the presidents I have studied changes them. For [PERSON], in [DATE], losing his wife and his mother on [DATE], in the same house. He goes to the Badlands, and he is suddenly out among people. Both he and [PERSON] had to move beyond their privileged class. [PERSON] and his time at [GPE], [GPE] [rehab facility], allowed [PERSON] to do that. And then they created a different sense of themselves, connected to other people-partly what you are talking about-wanting to make other people's lives better. Fate had dealt them an unkind hand, like it does to many, and they suddenly felt more deeply toward a wider range of people. [INTERVIEWED1] Exactly. And so I think there is a process you go through. I found during the course of my political career on the national scene-which is relatively compressed compared to some of these other presidents-there is a point where the vanity burns away and you have had your fill of your name in the papers, or big adoring crowds, or the exercise of power. And for me that happened fairly quickly. And then you are really focused on: What am I going to get done with this strange privilege that is been granted to me? How do I make myself worthy of it? And if you do not go through that, then you start getting into trouble, because then you are just [gesturing, as if climbing a ladder] clinging to prerogatives and the power and the attention. There is an expression that my daughters use: You get thirsty. And the thirst is unquenchable. [INTERVIEWED1] And the thirst is unquenchable. And that is what you see, I think, sometimes with somebody like a [PERSON]-a brilliant person who, early on, had ambitions that probably were not that different from an F.D.R., certainly not that different from an L.B.J. But that thirst overwhelms everything, and you start making decisions based solely on that. So that brings us to the question of temperament, which is probably the greatest separator in presidential leadership. There is that quote when [retired [ORG] justice] [PERSON], who met with F.D.R. after his inauguration, famously said [PERSON] had a second-class intellect but a first-class temperament. How would you describe your temperament and why it is fit for this office if, in fact, you think it is? [INTERVIEWED1] Well, whether it is fit for this office or not is up to historians like you to determine. I think it is fair to say that my temperament is [pause, seemingly in search of the right word] steady-and on the buoyant side. Do you think of yourself as an extrovert? [INTERVIEWED1] No. On the spectrum of successful politicians, I am not introverted the way some have been, but I am not an F.D.R. or [PERSON], who are just constantly ... Needing the people all the time. [INTERVIEWED1] ... in a crowd and just relishing it. I like my quiet time. There is a writer's sensibility in me sometimes, where I step back. But I do think that I am generally optimistic. I see tragedy and comedy and pain and irony and all that stuff. But in the end I think life is fascinating, and I think people are more good than bad, and I think that the possibilities of progress are real. I think people are born with that spirit. My father was orphaned when he was [DATE]. My mother died when I was young. But despite these sorrows my father remained an optimist. And that optimism was the greatest gift he gave to me-a sense of excitement about life that has carried me through everything. [INTERVIEWED1] Yes . . . . I think it is up to the [NORP] people and historians, et cetera, to decide. But I can tell you what I think served me well in this office, and that is this basic optimism and a capacity to take the long view on things. I do not buy the hype when everybody is saying how wonderful things are and how great I am, and I do not get too down when people say, This is a disaster and he is done for. I think I have said this before. Early in my presidency, I went to [GPE] to make a speech to the [NORP] world. And in [TIME], after the speech, we took helicopters out to the pyramids. And they had emptied the pyramids for us, and we could just wander around for [TIME] [at] the pyramids and the [FAC]. And the pyramids are one of those things that live up to the hype. They are elemental in ways that are hard to describe. And you are going to these tombs and looking at the hieroglyphics and imagining the civilization that built these iconic images. And I still remember it-because I had not been president that long at that point-thinking to myself, There were a lot of people during the period when these pyramids were built who thought they were really important. And there was the equivalent of cable news and television and newspapers and [ORG] and people anguishing over their relative popularity or position at any given time. And now it is all just covered in dust and sand. And all that people know [[DATE]] are the pyramids. Sometimes I carry with me that perspective, which tells me that my particular worries on [DATE]-how I am doing in the polls or what somebody is saying about me ... for good or for ill-is not particularly relevant. What is relevant is: What am I building that lasts? And here in [GPE], hopefully, what we are building are not just pyramids, are not icons to one pharaoh. What we are building is a culture and a way of living together that we can look back on and say, [This] was good, was inclusive, was kind, was innovative, was able to fulfill the dreams of as many people as possible. And that part of my temperament I think has served me well. So when you think about the importance of that part of temperament in a president, how do you view what is happening with [PERSON] right now? [INTERVIEWED1] Well, you know, I see [PERSON] as a phenomenon of an expression of certain fears, certain resentments, that have been a running thread in [NORP] history. Yes, not unlike [DATE], when so many of those same anxieties and fears had developed in the wake of the Industrial Revolution-immigration, technological change, people moving from farms to cities. [INTERVIEWED1] Right. And so there are always going to be figures who become symbols and expressions of those fears and resentments. So he is not unique in that sense. I do not think it is a surprise for me to say that I do not think his temperament is suited for this office. But it is not something that I have to emphasize because I think the majority of the [NORP] people have figured that out. And the people are looking at his opponent, [PERSON], as well. I am reminded of another moment that had to do with [ORG]-and you. You were in [GPE] late in [DATE], and somebody asked you if you'd really be willing to put into your inner circle [CARDINAL] of your chief rivals, even if his or her spouse were an occasional pain in the butt. And then you referred to [PERSON]. You said, I do not want to jump the gun, [but] I will tell you, though, that my goal is to have the best possible government. And you explained: [PERSON] basically pulled in all the people who had been running against him into his [ORG] because, whatever personal feelings there were, the issue was 'How can we get this country through this time of crisis?' And then when you chose [PERSON] to be secretary of [ORG], of course, team of rivals emerged as a term to characterize her selection. It came full circle when I was at the [PERSON] party [TIME] before your inauguration. [PERSON] came up to me and said, in a teasing way, [INTERVIEWER], this is all your fault. You are responsible for my being secretary of [ORG]. She meant [PERSON], of course, not me. But obviously your successor matters a great deal to you, as does the importance of carrying out the things that you care about. It is like a relay race, as you have said, so the next person will take over. And that is an important part of what you need to think about now. [INTERVIEWED1] Absolutely. I am a firm believer that you do not do anything significant by yourself. Again, maybe there are exceptions. There is the [PERSON] or the [PERSON]. Yes, [PERSON] wrote that there are certain geniuses, of which he was not one. But [PERSON] was one. [PERSON] could write a poem that nobody else could write. [INTERVIEWED1] I do not fall in that category. I marvel at those people who are true geniuses of that sort. But what I have seen in my own life is that when I get something important done it is because of a lot of other people-some who get credit, some who do not . You look at something like health care, the Affordable Care Act. And for all the controversy, we now have [CARDINAL] people who have health insurance who did not have it. It is actually proven to be more effective, cheaper than even advocates like me expected. But I still view it as a starter home, in the same way that when [PERSON] started [ORG] and [ORG], or [ORG] started [ORG], there were a series of refinements and incremental improvements that overall made the system more sturdy. [PERSON] used to say about his domestic anti-poverty programs that made up [ORG] that it was a process, from crawling to walking to running. [INTERVIEWED1] I think about this being a relay race in that way. I welcome the next president saying, This is a good start. Here are some additional things we should not or should be doing. Here are the things that we have learned from the first phases of this that could stand improvement. That is a good thing. To me that is not a failure on my part. That is not a criticism of me. That is the nature of how social change comes about. So in that sense I do not see myself doing this alone. But in a more granular way I think about all the people who were involved in getting that thing passed. There were staff people here, whose names nobody knows, who worked tirelessly to make this happen. They know, they know. [INTERVIEWED1] Legislative folks, who were up on the [FAC] till [TIME] trying to get a particular provision done. Teams here who were crunching the numbers to figure out how we could pay for it. Members of [ORG] who voted for this thing knowing that the politics were really tough for them, and that they might lose their race[s]. There were just a lot of people who ended up making enormous sacrifices-and I am the front man of the band. But it does not work without them. And that is why I was always amused that people were either skeptical or surprised that I would choose [PERSON] as a secretary of [ORG]. To my mind, having somebody smart, tough, capable with her own stature, who could travel around the world and command the stage, was a huge asset. What I also knew-partly by virtue of her having served as First Lady, and partly just because I knew her and had observed her-was [that] her dedication to the country would lead her to operate with great loyalty regardless of ... Her own ambitions. [INTERVIEWED1] ... whatever ambitions she may have had or lingering aggravations that carried over from the campaign. I detected a note of wistfulness in the speech you gave at [GPE] [DATE]. You talked about what it was like in the legislature there when you could cross party lines and share drinks and play poker, making it harder to call your opponents fascists or idiots. It makes me want to ask: Did you absorb, back in [DATE], the full impact of what [ORG] minority leader [PERSON] meant when he said that his party's most important objective would be to make you a [CARDINAL]-term president ? Did you realize how polarized it was going to become? [INTERVIEWED1] No. I would say that is one of the things that surprised me, mainly because we were in the midst of [an economic] crisis. And I was politically aware during the [PERSON] presidency, so I'd watch the ways in which slash-and-burn politics had come to be the norm nationally-some of the things that [former [ORG] Speaker] [PERSON] had unleashed with his revolution. But that was during a period of relative quiet and prosperity. Right. So there was more freedom to play around. [INTERVIEWED1] And so that kind of reality-TV game playing you could forgive. I expected when we were undergoing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression that there would be at least a span of time on the front end in which people would rally. And the fact that that was missing probably showed my navet?. I did not anticipate that fully. But I got educated pretty quick on it. And I do think that there has been a degree of venom and viciousness and anger that has been unleashed in our national politics that is qualitatively different in at least our modern history. And why do you think it happened? [INTERVIEWED1] It is a combination of things. We have talked about these things before. Political gerrymandering makes the incentive for most members of [ORG] to play to the extremes of their base rather than to the center. The Balkanization of the media means that nobody is having a single conversation with a single set of agreed-upon facts and assumptions the way you had as recently as [DATE]. The influence of not just big money, but dark money. The collapse of party structures. The fact that most legislators now, most members of [ORG], do not live here but travel back and forth. Yeah, all these things have contributed. So when you get upset with this lack of discourse, what do you do? When [PERSON] was very upset about isolationists, when he knew we had to deal with World War II, he would actually write drafts of speeches where he would call them out by name. [INTERVIEWED1] Yes. And then he would do Draft [CARDINAL], Draft [CARDINAL], Draft [CARDINAL], and [CARDINAL] of his young speechwriters said, Oh, my God, you cannot say this. And then by Draft [CARDINAL], the offending phrase was gone. [PERSON], as you know, wrote hot letters to people. And then he'd cool down and did not send them. Have you ever written any drafts of speeches or hot letters? [INTERVIEWED1] I do it all the time. What do you mean you do it all the time? [INTERVIEWED1] I do it all the time. I will write a response-a full rant. No kidding? [INTERVIEWED1] And then I will crumple it up. Every once in a while, my team here will hear me go on a rant. Generally speaking, people who know me will tell you that my public persona is not that different from my private persona. I am who I am. You sort of get what you see with me. The [CARDINAL] exceptions are that I curse more than I should, and I find myself cursing more in this office than I had in my previous life. And fortunately both my chief of staff and my national-security adviser have even bigger potty mouths than me, so it is O.K. And the second thing is that I can be much more sarcastic and, I think, sometimes withering in my assessments of things than I allow to show in my public life. Well, we see it sometimes. [INTERVIEWED1] Yes, every once in a while you see it. You have said you'd rather be alive now than any other time. But do you ever wish you had been president in another era? Suppose you'd been around in [PERSON]'s time, when your written word would be pamphletized, when everybody would be reading the entire speech and they'd be talking to each other about it. And [PERSON] was right for the era when punchy language worked. [PERSON] was perfect for conversational style on radio, [PERSON] and [PERSON] for the big TV networks. And you are governing in the age of the Internet, with its divergent voices and sound bites. [INTERVIEWED1] It is an interesting question. As I said earlier, there is a big part of me that has a writer's sensibility. And so that is how I think. That is how I pursue truth. That is how I hope to communicate truth to people. And I know that is not how it is always received. Because it gets chopped up. Or if it is too long, then it is dismissed as being professorial, or abstract, or long-winded. But I tell you what, though. [Long pause.] I am named [INTERVIEWED1]. I am [NORP]. And I have been elected twice to this office with the majorities of the [NORP] people. So something is working. And you can tell yourself that. [INTERVIEWED1] Somebody is reading some of these speeches. And it is interesting: I just had an exchange with a columnist who I like, but it was on the topic of using the phrase radical Islam, and the criticism that is come from some of the [NORP]. And this is a columnist who is generally sympathetic and a thoughtful person but actually thought that I was underestimating the importance of having this pithy phrase that includes [ORG] to accurately label the nature of the threat. And he said, Well, you acknowledge all these truths, but you do it in long paragraphs, and that is not sufficient. And I took the criticism to heart. But I responded to him, saying, I refuse to give in to the notion that the [NORP] people cannot handle complicated information. Because I know the [NORP] people. I have met a lot of them. I have met a lot more of them than any columnist has, or any talking head on TV has. And they are pretty sophisticated. They are not always paying attention, and there is a lot of noise out there, but when they have the time, they are not looking to be spoken down to and there is no requirement to dumb things down. They get it. You think about the race speech that I gave in [GPE] [in [DATE]] when the [PERSON] stuff broke [regarding the [INTERVIEWER]s' [GPE] pastor]. That was a pretty complicated piece of business, but I think people heard me. Now there are filters, there are a lot of filters there, and so sometimes it is hard to get at folks. What I miss is just the fact that there is not a single conversation, but there is just this ... It would have been easier if there were [CARDINAL] television networks. [INTERVIEWED1] Right. So I do not need to go back to [GPE]. If I just had [the benefits of] what [PERSON] had, then the concentrated power of the bully pulpit would be an enormous advantage. I think part of the reason that I have been successful, though, despite maybe not always fitting my message into the pre-packaged formulas, is there is this whole other media ecology out there of the Internet and Instagram and memes and talk shows and comedy, and I am pretty good at that. I [give] maybe the long-winded speeches that not everybody reads, but I can also do a slow jam on [PERSON] better than most. You are proud of that, are not you? [INTERVIEWED1] No, no, no, I mean- I am teasing you. [INTERVIEWED1] I mean, I have fun with it sometimes. But it actually serves a purpose because I can-I think I have a pretty good take on popular culture that maybe makes up for the fact that I am not a sound-bite politician for the [TIME] news. And as a consequence I think I am able to reach a lot of folks, despite the fact that the conventional news media sometimes says, You know, this speech is too long, or It is too complicated, or He needs to have better sound bites, or what have you. Because they are not seeing me on Between Two Ferns [laughter] trying to sell the Affordable Care Act to young people, and the fact that we are getting [CARDINAL] of hits on something that is not on conventional TV. So what do you regret the most that you wish you had done-or that you might have been able to deal better with? [INTERVIEWED1] Oh, look, the list of things I wish I had gotten done is long. I do not mean what you did not get done, but what you might have done differently. [INTERVIEWED1] What I might have done differently. Yes, even that list is perpetually renewing itself because each day I say, Maybe if I had done that just a little bit different or that a little bit better. I know there are problems that I say to myself, If maybe I was a little more gifted I might have been able to solve. But that is not because I believe what I did was a mistake. It is that maybe it required the talents of a [PERSON]. So when I think about the polarization that occurred in [DATE] and [DATE], I have gone back and I have looked at my proposals and my speeches and the steps we took to reach out to [ORG]. And the notion that we were not engaging [ORG], or that we were overly partisan, or we did not schmooze enough, or we did not reach out enough to [NORP]-that whole narrative just is not true. But that narrative took hold, right? [INTERVIEWED1] What I can say is maybe if I had the genius of [PERSON], or the charm of F.D.R. ... Or, like [PERSON], you had them over [TIME] for dinner. [INTERVIEWED1] Or the energy of [PERSON], or the legislative acumen of [PERSON], or all those things wrapped into one, maybe things would have turned out differently. On the other hand, when I read history, I [see] what typically happens to presidents and the other party during tumultuous times and how ... people react when the economy is collapsing and they are losing their homes, losing their pensions-it sort of tracks, what ended up happening, because some of that is human nature. So I guess my point is that there are always things that I think I wish I could have done better. I wish I could have persuaded the public more or my colleagues more, here in [GPE], around a particular course of action. But there are not a lot of situations where I look back and I say, The decision I actually made or the course we actually pursued was the wrong course. That is what [PERSON] used to say: I think of the things that have come before me during [DATE] and the decisions that I have made, I say to myself-well, I have done the best I could and turn over and go to sleep. [INTERVIEWED1] Exactly. Another good example of that is the situation in [GPE], which haunts me constantly. I would say of all the things that have happened during the course of my presidency the knowledge that you have [CARDINAL] of people who have been killed, [CARDINAL] who have been displaced, [makes me] ask myself what might I have done differently along the course of [DATE]. The conventional arguments about what could have been done are wrong. The notion that if we had provided some more modest arms to [NORP] rebels-that somehow that would have led to [[NORP] president [PERSON]'s overthrow more decisively. The notion that if I had taken a pinprick strike when the chemical-weapons issue came out, as opposed to negotiating and getting all those chemical weapons out-that that would have been decisive. All those things I tend to be skeptical about. But I do ask myself, Was there something that we had not thought of? Was there some move that is beyond what was being presented to me that maybe a [PERSON] could have seen, or an [PERSON] might have figured out? So that is the kind of thing that tends to occupy me when I have the time to think about it-mainly because I think that in this job one of the things you realize is there are problems that just end up being really hard and by definition the only problems that come to my desk are the ones that nobody else can solve. Usually, I am pretty good about sorting through the options and then making decisions that I am confident are the best decisions in that moment, given the information we have. But there are times where I think I wish I could have imagined a different level of insight. Was there ever a time, at the beginning of your presidency, when you were haunted? The night [PERSON] was first elected, he told his son [PERSON], All my life I have been afraid of [CARDINAL] thing-fire.... I am just afraid that I may not have the strength to do this job. He was a paralyzed man, so he never locked his door. Did you ever feel that? When confronting the explosion that you came into, with the recession and the difficulty we were facing? [INTERVIEWED1] [Long pause.] Honestly, no. And that is the only time I think F.D.R. felt it, too. And then by [DATE] he was O.K. [INTERVIEWED1] Anybody who gets into bed and turns out the lights [TIME] in [FAC] probably feels a little bit of a start, where you say, Goodness ... This is me, and I am here. [INTERVIEWED1] Right. And I have got to make a bunch of decisions. And so there is a little bit of a jolt that you feel. There was not a time where I felt fearful that I could not make the best decisions possible. The times where I had been anguished almost exclusively had to do with deploying our men and women overseas. The first [NORP] decision to surge additional troops there because the situation was deteriorating. I remember giving a speech at [FAC] and seeing all those amazing young people and knowing that some would be sent and not every one of them would come back. Weighing that-those never get easy. But that is a feeling different than fear. It is a feeling of the weight of the decision. And a different feeling, but related, is the decisions I have had to make to launch strikes. I do not want ever to be a president who is comfortable and at ease with killing people. I do not want my generals or my defense secretary or my national-security team to ever feel deploying weapons to kill people as routine or abstract, even if the targets are bad people. And that weighs on me. So what is it going to be like when this weight is lifted? What are you going to be able to do that you have not been able to do for [DATE]? [INTERVIEWED1] Well, I am hoping I can take a walk. And ... Somewhere else, not just with ... [INTERVIEWED1] Yes, not just around and around the South Lawn with my chief of staff and my team and my dogs. What else? You drove around in a car in that comedy video with [PERSON], right? You had not done it for a while. [INTERVIEWED1] I am looking to negotiate to see maybe if I can take a drive somewhere at least on some open road. You mean before the end of your term? [INTERVIEWED1] Yeah. You know, the other guys could. [PERSON] drove [PERSON] almost to the edge of a cliff, in [GPE]-and [PERSON] was so afraid. [PERSON] had his amphibious car when he was president. He tricked me and took me in his car [DATE], and [ORG] collaborated with him. [PERSON], behind the wheel, warned me, Be careful, we are going toward a lake. The brakes are not working. Well, we go into the lake: the car became a boat. Then he got so mad at me because I did not get scared. I'd figured, He is not going to die. And he said, Do not you [ORG] people have enough sense to be scared? So these earlier presidents could do things like that. It seems like things have tightened. [INTERVIEWED1] Oh, absolutely. I think since the systematic emergence of terrorism and the assassination attempts, everything has tightened. My hope is that it loosens back up once I leave. There are a couple of particular bodysurfing beaches that I have not been to in [GPE] for a long time that I want to go back to. And there are places I want to visit where if I am wearing a baseball cap and some sunglasses I think I can get away with and mingle in a crowd. But, you know, when I leave I will be [DATE], and I will have an entirely new chapter of my life-the work I want to do with a presidential-center library, creating a platform for the next generation of young leaders across disciplines to work together ... [and other] things that in some ways I suspect I am able to do better out of this office. You mean, having had this office. [INTERVIEWED1] Having had this office has given me this incredible perch from which to see how the world works. The power of the office is unique and it is a humbling privilege. With that power, however, also comes a whole host of institutional constraints. There are things I cannot say. There are things that ... You mean now, but you will later. [INTERVIEWED1] ... that I cannot say, not out of any political concerns, but out of prudential concerns of the office. There are institutional obligations I have to carry out that are important for a president of [GPE] to carry out, but may not always align with what I think would move the ball down the field on the issues that I care most deeply about. It must be so freeing, I think-because you now have this foundation to do the stuff you want to do, but also you are going to become more of a human being without this. [INTERVIEWED1] That is the hope. And, look, I have no doubt that there will be moments as the next inauguration approaches where I will feel melancholy or nostalgic. And leaving all these people. [INTERVIEWED1] And the team that you build here, the family that you build here, is powerful. But there is a reason why [PERSON] is always [CARDINAL] of the top [CARDINAL] presidents, and it is not because of his prowess as a military leader; it is not because of the incredible innovations in policy that he introduced. It is because he knew when it was time to go. And he understood that part of the experiment we were setting up was this idea that you serve the nation and then it is over, and then you are a citizen again. And that office of citizen remains important, but your ability to let go is part of the duty that you have. It is as important as taking hold of the office. That is part of our democracy. [INTERVIEWED1] As important as taking hold of the office is letting go of the office. And they are of a piece-it is an expression of our fidelity to the ideals upon which this nation was founded. I agree. There will be perks that you will miss, I am sure. [INTERVIEWED1] I will miss Air Force One. I will miss Marine One. I think I told you the story about [PERSON], that he had not personally dialed a phone call for so long that when he finally was out of the presidency he picked up the phone and he hears this buzz, and he said, What is this buzz? It is the dial tone, [INTERVIEWED1]. [INTERVIEWED1] I will say that, having a couple of teenage daughters, I am a little more plugged into [laughter] technology than maybe [PERSON] was.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwithjackiecalmesandmichaeldshearthenewyorktimes", "text": "So we are here with you, already [DATE] since the recession officially ended. And as your speech sort of laid out, you still have a situation where growth remains slow, income's is unequal, and a lot of [NORP] -- unemployment high -- and a lot of [NORP] start to worry that this is the new normal. Your intentions aside like you stated them out there in the speech, why should not we expect that you are going to leave behind an economy that is fragile, continued income inequality, and a weakened middle class? Well, obviously, what [ORG] does matters. As I said in the speech, the economy is far stronger now than it was [DATE]. Most economists believe that growth will actually pick up [DATE] and [DATE]. And the [CARDINAL] thing that could really screw things up would be if you have a manufactured crisis and [NORP] choose to play brinksmanship all over again. And I am glad to see that there are folks in the [ORG] who I think have already indicated that that is not good policy. We can have debates about fiscal issues without precipitating a crisis. Certainly the idea that we would not pay our bills and plunge not just [GPE] but potentially the world into another financial crisis makes absolutely no sense. But what I also said out there is true that if we stand pat, if we do not do anything, then growth will be slower than it should be. Unemployment will not go down as fast as it should. Income inequality will continue to rise. Wages, incomes, savings rates for middle-class families will continue to be relatively flat. And that is not a future that we should accept. So the entire intention of the speech is to make sure that we are focused on the right thing. It does not mean that I expect [NORP] to agree with all my prescriptions, but it is to say that the central problem we face and the one that we faced now that the immediate crisis is over is how do we build a broad-based prosperity. And I want to make sure that all of us in [GPE] are investing as much time, as much energy, as much debate on how we grow the economy and grow the middle class as we have spent over [DATE] arguing about how we reduce the deficits. But do you worry, [INTERVIEWED1], that that description of that sort of standing pat, what happens if you stand pat and the sort of slower than expected -- do you worry that that could end up being your legacy simply because of the obstruction that -- and the gridlock that does not seem to end? Well, let us separate it from me for [TIME], because I think if I am arguing for entirely different policies and [ORG] ends up pursuing policies that I think do not make sense and we get a bad result, it is hard to argue that'd be my legacy. And so I will worry about my legacy later or I will let historians worry about my legacy. I do worry about what is happening to ordinary families here is [GPE] and all across the country. When we know that rebuilding our infrastructure right now would put people back to work and it is never been cheaper for us to do so, and this is all deferred maintenance that we are going to have to do at some point anyway, I worry that we are not moving faster to seize the moment. When we know that families are getting killed by college costs, for us not to take bold action -- which means that young people are graduating with massive debt, they cannot buy a home as soon as they want, they cannot start that business that they have got a great idea for -- that worries me. So as I suggested in the speech, what I want to make sure everybody in [GPE] is obsessed with is how are we growing the economy, how are we increasing middle-class incomes and middle-class wages, and increasing middle-class security. And if we are not talking about that, then we are talking about the wrong thing. And if our debates around the budget do not have that in mind, then we have got the wrong focus. Well, you said it yourself in the speech that [GPE] has taken its eye off the ball. Do you have any -- are you culpable at all in that? Did you -- it is [DATE] -- it is [DATE] now, it is [DATE]. Do you wish you were giving a speech like this earlier and done it more often? If you look over [DATE], we right away delivered on the promise to make sure that our tax code was more reflective of our values; that middle-class families locked in relief that they needed; folks like me, at the very top, paid a little bit more. That, by the way, was a fundamental shift that was [DATE] in the making. That was a big argument. Immediately after that, obviously, we had the tragedy in [GPE] and the need for a response. And my wish and hope had been that that was a quicker piece of business and that we had gone ahead and moved forward on that. Immigration reform actually squarely fits into what I am discussing right now. As I indicated before, we know the economy will grow faster if we get immigration reform done. We know that [ORG] will be shored up if we get immigration reform done. And the [ORG]'s done the right thing by passing a strong bipartisan bill. So what I will absolutely admit to is that I have been here - I have been in [GPE] long enough now to know that if once a week I am not talking about jobs, the economy, and the middle class, then all manner of distraction fills the void. Is there any part of your agenda moving forward that you think you are willing to move to the backburner so that you can spend more time on the economy? Well, immigration reform we have got to get done, and that right now is just a matter of the [ORG] [NORP] recognizing that both the [NORP] people, businesses, labor, evangelicals -- there is a broad consensus to go ahead and pass that bill, and if that bill was on the floor [DATE] it would pass. Beyond that, though, we are working on a range of other issues -- from climate change to reforming government to reducing the backlog in the [ORG]. So there is a bunch of stuff we are going to be doing. I will be spending my time over [DATE] talking about the issues in more detail that I discussed [DATE] so that by the time [ORG] gets back in [DATE], I want to make sure that the [NORP] people are paying attention and asking themselves, are we doing everything we can to boost middle-class incomes, ladders of opportunity, and middle-class security. And if we are doing that, then ultimately I think that we will not get everything done that I want to see done, but we will have shifted away from what I think has been a bad - a damaging framework in [GPE], which is to constantly think about is there more we can do to cut the deficit without asking are we making the right cuts, the smart cuts that actually help people in their own lives and help us grow over the long term. Well, in contrast with the jobs plan that is now what you are reflecting [DATE], it is [DATE] now, and which would measurably add to employment the studies show. Right. But in contrast with that, the policies that have been in place since the start of your second term, fiscal policies -- Right, because of the sequester. -- that you and [ORG] agreed to -- right -- and some of the laws -- the payroll tax cut, and the increase in upper-end taxes to some extent -- but all of those things are by any economist's measure a drag on the economy. There is not a day goes by I do not get some analyst saying that -- and that the [ORG] is pursuing expansionary policies to offset that. How can you -- how are you going to -- what exactly can you do [DATE] to overcome the [NORP]' opposition and change that, to end sequester? Well, let me back up, [PERSON]. First of all, as the economy got stronger during the course of my presidency, I had always committed to a responsible reduction in the deficit. I think that was the smart thing to do, the right thing to do, and good for our growth. And if we are growing faster, if businesses and the markets have more confidence, then ultimately that benefits middle-class families as well. So I make no apologies for putting forward budgets consistently that, as I had promised, would gradually reduce the deficit. Now, the sequester I did not want to be in place. When you say I agreed to it, what happened, as you will recall, in [DATE] is, is that we had the prospect of either default or a willingness on the part of [NORP] and [NORP] to spend [DATE] trying to come up with a sensible way to reduce the deficit. The sequester was supposed to be something that was so damaging to the economy that both parties would want to avoid it. The fact that [NORP] embraced the sequester as what they consider a win during the course of [DATE], despite all the damage that they said they wanted to avoid, for example, to our military, is different from me agreeing to the sequester. All right? So that is point [CARDINAL]. Point [CARDINAL], every economist will tell you that if we are being smart about growth and we are thinking about jobs and we are thinking about the middle class, but we are also thinking about fiscal responsibility, then what we should be doing is making sure that the drop-off in government spending on vital things like education and infrastructure do not go down too fast, and that rather we look at what the real problem is, which is long-term health care costs. Because of the Affordable Care Act and a lot of changes that are taking place out there among providers, we are starting to see health care costs slow. That is a positive. If we can build on that, then we can capture the same amount of savings that we are capturing through the sequester and use those to make sure that we are not cutting vital investments that I talked about [DATE], and we can help middle-class families. Now, I think there are probably going to be [CARDINAL] different ways for you guys to ask me the same question, which is, But there is [ORG]. [laughter] More specifically, There is the [ORG] [NORP], and what are you going to do about that? Who are still embracing sequestration and who are still willing to use the debt limit to go to the mat. Well, this is what they say. On the other hand, we also have a number of very thoughtful and sensible [NORP] over in the [ORG] who have said that we should not play brinksmanship, that we should come up with a long-term plan. I met with a couple of [ORG] [NORP] over [DATE] who would like to see that happen. They are not the loudest voices in the room at the moment. And part of what I'd like to see over [DATE] is, if we are having a conversation that is framed as how are we growing the economy, how are we strengthening the middle class, how are we putting people back to work, how are we making college more affordable, how are we bringing manufacturing back -- the answer to those questions I think force a different result than if we are constantly asking ourselves how can we cut the deficit more, faster, sooner. Have you yielded anything from your outreach to [NORP]? And do you still have hope for a [DATE] deal by [DATE]? I think it is still possible. There are certainly [NORP] who are deeply concerned about the effects of sequester. It is been interesting -- I have talked to a number of them who are from deeply red states, consider themselves very conservative, who say it does not make sense for us to cut discretionary spending more; it does not make sense for us to cut education further -- because they are seeing the impacts in their districts. Certainly there are a bunch of [NORP] who say for us to hollow out our military as steeply, drastically as we are doing if sequester stays in place for [DATE] makes no sense. So if the [NORP] people have confidence that there is a path that will grow the economy faster, put more people back to work, that does not involve massive new federal spending programs, but instead just make sure that we are investing in the right things, and if we are being attentive to debt and deficits over a [DATE] time horizon, then potentially some of those [NORP] start giving voice to their concerns a little more loudly than they are doing right now. But one of the challenges, as I said in the speech, is that there is almost a kneejerk habit right now that if I am for it, then they have got to be against it. And I think there are a lot of [NORP] who are frustrated by that, because they want to be for something, not just against something. But they have got to work through that pattern that is developed over [DATE]. A couple of slightly different topics. On the economy, the [ORG] is obviously an important player. You have got a big decision ahead of yourself in terms of the chairman. What are you looking for in a chairman? And there were reports [DATE] that you are very close to naming [PERSON] as the new [ORG] chairman. True? I have not made a final decision. I have narrowed it down to some extraordinarily qualified candidates. Do you want to say who? No. [laughter] I tried. And what I am looking for is somebody who understands the [ORG] has a dual mandate, that that is not just lip service; that it is very important to keep inflation in check, to keep our dollar sound, and to ensure stability in the markets. But the idea is not just to promote those things in the abstract. The idea is to promote those things in service of the lives of ordinary [NORP] getting better. And when unemployment is still too high, and long-term unemployment is still too high, and there is still weak demand in a lot of industries, I want a [ORG] chairman that can step back and look at that objectively and say, let us make sure that we are growing the economy, but let us also keep an eye on inflation, and if it starts heating up, if the markets start frothing up, let us make sure that we are not creating new bubbles. And do you have a timeline in mind for announcing that? I think you can anticipate that over [DATE], an announcement will be made. [PERSON], by the way, has done a fine job as [ORG] chairman. And when you look at [PERSON] testimony, not just [DATE] but over [DATE], what he is consistently said is right now, our priority needs to be growing the economy faster and strengthening incomes for ordinary [NORP]. If we do that, our deficits come down because we are bringing in more revenue. If we do that, it becomes easier for us to handle the long-term fiscal challenges. And one of the interesting things that we do not talk about enough is the contrast between what is happened in [GPE] and what is happened in a lot of other developing countries, Europe in particular. It is pretty rare where we have the chance to look at [CARDINAL] policy approaches and follow them over [DATE] and see which one worked. And the fact is there are a lot of [NORP] countries who followed the prescription that [ORG] are calling for right now, and not only have they lagged well below where we have gone in terms of growth, in many cases their debt and their deficits have actually gone up because their economy is still effectively in recession. And although we have not been growing as fast as we would like, we have consistently outperformed those countries that followed the recipe that the [ORG] [NORP] are offering right now. Now, I am more sympathetic to those [NORP] countries because they, in some cases, did not have a choice. They do not have the dominant world currency. They do not have people who want to invest in their countries the way folks around the world still want to invest in ours. But in some ways, we have got evidence here. This is not an abstract argument. We know what is needed to make our economy grow right now. And if we grow our economy, and middle-class families are doing better, and housing prices are stronger, and young people are starting families of their own and they are jobs at good wages, that is the thing that will bring deficits down the fastest. A couple other quick subjects that are economic-related. [FAC] pipeline -- [NORP] especially talk about that as a big job creator. You have said that you would approve it only if you could be assured it would not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon in the atmosphere. Is there anything that [GPE] could do or the oil companies could do to offset that as a way of helping you to reach that decision? Well, first of all, [INTERVIEWER1], [NORP] have said that this would be a big jobs generator. There is no evidence that that is true. And my hope would be that any reporter who is looking at the facts would take the time to confirm that the most realistic estimates are this might create maybe [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] jobs during the construction of the pipeline -- which might take [DATE] or [CARDINAL] -- and then after that we are talking about somewhere between [CARDINAL] and [CARDINAL] [chuckles] jobs in a economy of [CARDINAL] working people. Yet there are a number of unions who want you to approve this. Well, look, they might like to see [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] jobs initially. But that is a blip relative to the need. So what we also know is, is that that oil is going to be piped down to the Gulf to be sold on the world oil markets, so it does not bring down gas prices here in [GPE]. In fact, it might actually cause some gas prices in the Midwest to go up where currently they cannot ship some of that oil to world markets. Now, having said that, there is a potential benefit for us integrating further with a reliable ally to the north our energy supplies. But I meant what I said; I am going to evaluate this based on whether or not this is going to significantly contribute to carbon in our atmosphere. And there is no doubt that [GPE] at the source in those tar sands could potentially be doing more to mitigate carbon release. And if they did, could that offset the concerns about the pipeline itself? We have not seen specific ideas or plans. But all of that will go into the mix in terms of [PERSON] decision or recommendation on this issue. And then -- I will let [PERSON] go -- but on the employer mandate, I do not think you have been asked the question directly why you made the decision to delay it, and whether, given your criticism of President [PERSON] over [DATE] for potentially exceeding his executive authority, there is been a lot of folks out there on the [NORP] side who claim that somehow you have exceeded your authority on this. Is there anything to that? Well, this was a very practical decision that actually does not go to the heart of us implementing the Affordable Care Act. The majority of employers in this country provide health insurance to their employees. And the number of employers who are potentially subject to the employer mandate is relatively small. The way the law was originally written, it did not take into account the fact that we do not necessarily need to load up the vast majority of companies that are already doing the right thing with a bunch of additional paperwork; are there simpler ways for us to allow them to certify that they are providing health insurance? And if they do that, then the purpose, the spirit of the law is met, and we can concentrate on the few bad actors who are unwilling to provide health insurance to their employees even though they can afford it, and they are relatively large employers. And businesses came to us and said, listen, we were supportive of providing health insurance to employees, in fact, we provide health insurance to our employees; we understand you want to get at the bad actors here, but are there ways to provide us some administrative relief? And what we said was, given that that is not critical to standing up the marketplaces where people are going to actually be able to buy lower-cost, high-quality insurance and get the tax credits that make it affordable for them, we thought it made sense to give [DATE] not only for companies to prepare, but also for us to work with [ORG] and others to see if there are just ways we can make this a little bit simpler for companies who are already doing the right thing. This is the kind of routine modifications or tweaks to a large program that is starting off that in normal times in a normal political atmosphere would draw a yawn from everybody. The fact that something like this generates a frenzy on [NORP] is consistent with the fact that they have voted to repeal this thing [CARDINAL] times without offering a alternative that is plausible. And from what I understand, based on recent reporting, they have just given up on offering an alternative. So essentially -- their central economic plan that they are currently presenting involves making sure that [CARDINAL] [NORP] cannot get health insurance; that people with preexisting conditions are potentially locked out of the market; that the rebates that people have received from insurance companies are sent back; that young people who are right now on their parents' plan because they are [DATE] or under, that they suddenly do not have health insurance. I do not understand the argument that that somehow grows the economy or strengthens the middle class. And during the course of implementation, are there going to be some glitches? Are there going to be some complaints from employers who are still trying to figure it out and may not know what subsidies are available to them? Absolutely. Are there some folks who may say, we are going to try to figure out ways not to provide health insurance to our employees? Yes. But that is a small proportion of our overall economy, and the principle that everybody should be able to get health insurance is one that the vast majority of [NORP] agree with. People questioned your legal and constitutional authority to do that unilaterally -- to delay the employer mandate. Did you consult with your lawyer? [PERSON], if you heard me on stage [DATE], what I said was that I will seize any opportunity I can find to work with [ORG] to strengthen the middle class, improve their prospects, improve their security -- No, but specifically - -- but where [ORG] is unwilling to act, I will take whatever administrative steps that I can in order to do right by the [NORP] people. And if [ORG] thinks that what I have done is inappropriate or wrong in some fashion, they are free to make that case. But there is not an action that I take that you do not have some folks in [ORG] who say that I am usurping my authority. Some of those folks think I usurp my authority by having the gall to win the presidency. And I do not think that is a secret. But ultimately, I am not concerned about their opinions -- very few of them, by the way, are lawyers, much less constitutional lawyers. I am concerned about the folks who I spoke to [DATE] who are working really hard, are trying to figure out how they can send their kids to college, are trying to make sure that they can save for their retirement. And if I can take steps on their behalf, then I am going to do so. And I would hope that more and more of [ORG] will say, you know what, since that is our primary focus, we are willing to work with you to advance those ideals. But I am not just going to sit back if the only message from some of these folks is no on everything, and sit around and twiddle my thumbs for [DATE]. Polls [DATE] have shown your health care law has lost support. What are you going to be doing to build support? We are going to implement it. Are you going to be getting out on the road? Here is what will build support, given that we have been outspent [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL] from the other side with all kinds of distortions about health care. Here is what we are going to do to beat back that misinformation. On [DATE], people are going to be able to start signing up. And if right now they are buying insurance on the individual market, they are going to get on those computers or they are going to make a phone call to [CARDINAL] of these call centers and they are going to find out that they can save [PERCENT], [PERCENT], or [PERCENT] on their premiums. And people who have not been able to get insurance before are going to be able to finally get insurance. And people who lose their jobs in the interim and find out that they have got a preexisting condition, it is hard for them to get insurance or they cannot afford [ORG], they are going to have a place to go. And over the course of [DATE], as people sign up, and it works, and lo and behold, the people who already have health insurance are not being impacted at all other than the fact that their insurance is more secure and they are getting free preventive care, and all the nightmare scenarios and the train wrecks and the sky is falling predictions that come from the other side do not happen, then health care will become more popular. But until then, when we are getting outspent [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL] and people are just uncertain about what all this means for them, we are going to continue to have some polls like that. And me just making more speeches explaining it in and of itself will not do it. The test of this is going to be is it working. And if it works, it will be pretty darn popular. [DATE] on [GPE] coming up soon. Are you going to do anything to mark it? Are you planning on being a part of the 50th anniversary? Absolutely. It is obviously a historic, seminal event in the country. It is part of my generation's formative memory and it is a good time for us to do some reflection. Obviously, after the [PERSON] case, a lot of people have been thinking about race, but I always remind people -- and, in fact, I have a copy of the original program in my office, framed -- that that was a march for jobs and justice; that there was a massive economic component to that. When you think about the coalition that brought about civil rights, it was not just folks who believed in racial equality; it was people who believed in working folks having a fair shot. It was [PERSON] and the [ORG] coming down here because they understood that if there are some workers who are not getting a fair deal then ultimately that is going to undercut their ability to get a fair deal. And if there is [CARDINAL] thing that I wanted to try to emphasize [DATE] in this speech, it is that [GPE] has always worked better when everybody has a chance to succeed. I had a conversation [DATE] with a guy named [PERSON], who I have known for a long time. He was my professor actually at [ORG]. Right. I actually knew [PERSON] when I was a state senator and he had put together this seminar to just talk about some of the themes that he had written about in Bowling Alone, the weakening of the community fabric and the impact it is having on people. And the work he is doing right now has to do with this issue of inequality. And it applies to a city like [GPE], where [DATE], anybody in this town who wanted to find a job, they could go get a job. They could go get it at the [GPE] plant. They could go get it with the railroad. It might be hard work, it might be tough work, but they could buy a house with it. The kids here all went to the same school -- the banker's kid and the guy working at the [ORG] plant's going to the same school. They have got the same social support. College is affordable for all of them. They do not have to take out $[MONEY][MONEY] [MONEY] of debt to do it. And there was a sense of not upward mobility in the abstract; it was part and parcel of who we were as [NORP]. And that is what is been eroding over [DATE], well before the financial crisis. Now, the financial crisis made things a lot worse. And so I had to spend [DATE] in my presidency getting us back to ground level. We had to make sure the banking system was not collapsing. We had to make sure the auto industry did not collapse. We had to make sure that we put people back to work short term and boosted demand until the markets got going and consumers got more confident and housing started to recover. And so here we are, having dealt with this massive crisis, but those trends -- that erosion of what a [GPE] or a [GPE], [GPE], where [PERSON] lived -- those trends have continued. And that is what people sense. That is why people are anxious. That is why people are frustrated. That is what they talk to me about and that is what they write to me about: I am doing okay right now, but what I have seen over [DATE] and what I learned profoundly during this crisis is that the ground under my feet just is not as secure, and that the work I am doing may not be rewarded. And everything that I am proposing and everything I will be proposing over [DATE] goes right at that issue. And if that is not what [GPE]'s talking about, then we will be missing the boat. And racial tensions will not get better; they may get worse, because people will feel as if they have got to compete with some other group to get scraps from a shrinking pot. If the economy is growing, everybody feels invested. Everybody feels as if we are rolling in the same direction. And so a lot of the other issues that we are talking about -- whether it is climate change or immigration, or how we manage our trade relations -- all those are eased if we have got our economic act together. But that is not what we talk about. And it is true that [ORG] moves at such a glacial pace [DATE] that sometimes if you start a bill like immigration and you are thinking this should be done by now, it seems to take [DATE] of folks just sitting around spinning their wheels, that can be frustrating. But we should be able to attend to some of these other issues even as we are staying focused on this central issue. That is at least what I am going to be doing. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED1].

Who is staying in the room? we are doing pictures. Oh my gosh. This is pretty cool. This is the place. This is where it happens. I like this man. You do? I do. It is my whole life. But you are like the big cheese now man, you cannot just pretend that you are just- What do you mean? Cannot I go on pretending? -you cannot pretend like your some, you know, low guy in a garage. You are now big time. Should I move? No, you know, this-partly because of the-the knick knacks around here man. Sure it is like the magic box. There is a lot of stuff going on in here. You have got the Give Me Shelter poster... Sure man-yeah I got a weird collection of things. You have got some drawings and pictures that we cannot really discuss. Right? Yeah I got pictures over there. I got [PERSON], I got-theres [PERSON], there is ... I got, yeah, just stuff. A lot of pictures of yourself, I mean it is a little narcissistic. Well I mean, people send them to me and I do not know that I really notice it. That they are all pictures of me. Maybe it is just comforting. [laughter] That is an old [ORG] review of a [CARDINAL] man show I did. There is the yeah... This is great. Well thanks man. It must bring back good memories every time you walk in here. Well do you have that thing where like there is a lot of good memories but then sometimes I am like do I need that thing anymore? Theres a book that I did not read that I have held on to for [DATE]. Do I need to keep that? You never know when you are gonna need it, right? Yeah gotta read that book that I could not understand [DATE]. It could be the book you need in [DATE]. Well you used to live around here. I did. Yeah. I was explaining to folks that, [GPE], these are my old haunts man. And do you- how close is that in your memory? Does it come right back? Absolutely. Yeah? Yeah through somewhat of a haze, it was college so you know. How old were you? Like [DATE] right? [DATE]? I was [DATE]. And you lived right down the street. Right down the street. How far away are you from that guy now? I mean do you-can you lock into that, can you find that in yourself? You know the truth is I am pretty much the same guy in a lot of ways. Yeah? Yeah, I started keeping a journal when I was around [DATE]. Yeah. And you know kept it up until I went to law school. Yeah. So for [DATE]. Sometimes I go back and I read this stuff and I am still the same guy. Which is good. Emotionally? Or obviously not emotionally but are there moments when you can sort of lock in, like what parts of your journal are you like ugh . Like are there still struggles that you were having then that you have now? Well now that is where stuff changed in the sense that stuff that was bugging you-by the time you are [DATE] either you have worked it out, or you just forgiven yourself and said look this is who I am. Oh I got to write that down. So I can just forgive myself? Well you know assuming that- It was not too heinous? - that you are not hurting anybody. But you know what I mean, I think that you, at that age are still trying to figure out- Right. - who are you, how do I live, what is my code- Right. - what is important to me, what is not important to me. And you are sorting through all sorts of contradictions. Yep. And you know by the time you get into [DATE], hopefully a lot of those have been resolved. You have come to terms and come to peace with some stuff and then some stuff you just said Well, you know what that is just who I am. I got some flaws I have got some strengths, and that is ok. Ok well what was-what do you think was the hardest thing for you to come to peace with was? Because I mean- I have read your work, I know the sort of struggles you were going through as a young man that were ongoing. Right. So, you know, what is the difference between being at peace and resolving a struggle and what were those struggles for you from [DATE]? I mean... Well, when I was here in [GPE] right, I had just come from [GPE] from high school. So some of it is just the same stuff that any kid when they are off to college are going through. Right, time to breaking out. You are breaking out, you are trying to figure out how to act right- Yeah. You know, how much fun should I have versus how much work? Yeah. What is my work about? Because now no one is telling you what you have to do. Did you have a vision though? Did you have work that you wanted to do? By, by [DATE] I did, that is why I transferred. Right, yeah. I mean, part of me transferring to [ORG], which is where I was going to school when I was living in Pasadena- Yeah. -was after [DATE] in college I started realizing there were some things that were important to me- having an impact on social justice issues, having something to say about poverty or race or things like that. What sparked that though? Yeah, you know because it seems to me like your identity, your personal identity sort of coincided almost exactly with your political identity. Well these are the kinds of contradictions I had to work out. So yeah you know, my mother was the biggest influence in my life, and this wonderful women. Yeah. But I am raised without a dad, [NORP], but not- Right, yeah. - grounded in a place with a lot of [NORP] culture. And so I am trying to figure out that I am scene, viewed and understood as a [NORP] man in America- Right. -but what does that mean? Yeah. I am absorbing all kinds of stereotypes and ideas from society. Like [PERSON], got that box right there. Like [PERSON] or [PERSON]. Right. Right and so I am trying on a whole bunch of outfits. Sure. Hats. Here is how I should act, here is what it means to be cool- Yeah. -here is what it means to be manly. Is that when you start smoking? Yeah exactly. Yeah me too. That is when you start smoking, drinking coffee, you get a leather jacket. And then you fight that for the rest of your life. Exactly. The worst. And then at a certain point, right around 20- Yeah. - right around [DATE] I started to figure out that a lot of the ideas that I had taken on about being a rebel or being a tough guy- Yeah. or being cool were really not me. They were just things that I was trying on because I was insecure, or I was a kid. Right. And that is an important moment in my life although also a scary one because then you start realizing, well I actually have to figure out what I really do believe and what is important and who am I really. And a lot of that revolved around issues of race and being able to say that I do not have to be one way to be both [NORP], but also someone who affirms the white side of my family. Right. I do not have to push back from the love and values that my mom instilled in me. Did you fight at all? For awhile? You know, she and I never fought because she was as sweet as could be, and she had a good sarcastic humor and she kind of put up with my adolescent rebellion. She was a very progressive person. She was. She was, I always call her she was the last great secular humanists. She was, you know, she thought that all religions had something to say. Right. And she thought all cultures were fascinating. So you were not brought up with that? With that religion thing at all? Yeah, no I mean we'd go to church for [DATE] sometimes Right. But we had a [NORP] temple across the street from the apartment where we were living. When I was in [GPE], that was a [NORP] country. Sure. So we had [NORP], but she instilled in me these core values that for awhile I thought were corny. Yeah. And then right around [DATE] you start realizing you know, honesty, kindness, hard work, responsibility, looking after other people-they are actually pretty good values. They are home spun, you know they come out of my [GPE] roots. But they are the things that ultimately ended up being the most important to me in how I tried to build my life. Well you know I want to, before I feel like we just jumped right into conversation. We did, that was quick. I am honored that you came. It is an amazing privilege for me to talk to you. Listen, I am a big fan and I love conversations like this cause if I thought to myself that when I was in college that I would be in a garage- Yeah -a couple miles away from where I was living doing an interview- As president. -as president with a comedian, I think that is a pretty hard scenario. Could not imagine it! It is not possible to imagine. No. It is not-nobody could imagine it. So that is fun. Well yeah so you know, there was a period you know when I was a little more attentive politically. I ran the country from my couch for [DATE]. [laughter] A lot of people do. Yeah, I hear from them all the time. You idiot! Why are not you doing it this way? Yeah I heard from them [TIME]. I got nothing but emails from people telling me what I gotta say to you. Yeah But I also know given the events of-of [DATE] that you know you had to put a lot in check, you lost someone you knew, and I am sorry for your loss. It was a horrible thing. And I appreciate you making the trip, I know that that must be difficult to compartmentalize that. And this is Friday- and this is going to go up [DATE]-and in terms of that, not to shift the conversation too far away from the candid. I mean, in your mind, what happens now? Because this is going to go up [DATE] and this is [DATE], so in relation to that event... Well look, they have captured the suspect. Yeah We have got a legal system that is going to work the way it is supposed to. Yeah. People are paying a lot of attention to it. The point I made in the immediate aftermath of the killing- On [DATE], yeah. -was that I have done this way too often. Yes. During the course of my presidency it feels as if a couple times a year- Yeah. - I end up having to speak to the country and speak to a particular community about a devastating loss. And you know the grieving that the country feels is real, the sympathy obviously, the prioritizing comforting the families. All that is important. But I think part of the point I wanted to make was that it is not enough to just feel bad. There are actions that could be taken that would make events like this less likely. And one of those actions we could take would be to enhance some basic common sense gun safety laws, that by the way a majority of gun owners support. Mmhm. This is unique to our country. There is no other advanced nation on earth that tolerates multiple shootings on a regular basis and considers it normal. And to some degree that is whats happened in this country. It has become something that we expect. They are framing it as if it is just a crazy person... It is a crazy person you cannot help it, but the truth of the matter is that this does not happen with this kind of frequency in other countries. When [GPE] had a mass killing- Yeah. - I think it was in [GPE] [DATE], it was just so shocking to the system the entire country said Well we are going to completely change our gun laws, and they did. And it has not happened since. Well and also when you came into office-I mean I know gun owners, I grew up in [GPE], my father was a gun owner-that there was this tremendous fear like that they are gonna come for our guns. And that is a common reframe. Well in fact, typically right after Newtown happened for example- Yeah. - gun sales shot up. Yeah. And ammunition shot up. And each time these events occur ironically gun manufacturers make out like bandits. Partly because of this fear thats turned up that the federal government and the black helicopters are all coming to get you guns. Yeah. And part of my argument is, you know it is important for folks to understand how hunting and sportsmen ship around firearms is really important to a lot of people. Mmhm. And it is a part of how they grew up, a part of you know, the bonding they had with their dads. Yep It evokes all kinds of memories and traditions and I think you have to be respectful of that. Mmhm. The question is just is there a way of accommodating that legitimate set of traditions with some common sense stuff that prevents a [DATE] who is angry about something or confused about something or is racist or is you know deranged, from going into a gun store and suddenly is packing- Yeah. -and can do enormous harm. mAnd that is not something that we have ever fully come to terms with, and unfortunately the grip of the [ORG] on [ORG] is extremely strong. I do not foresee any legislative action being taken in this [ORG] and I do not see any reelection happening until the [NORP] public feels a sufficient sense of urgency and tell themselves This is not normal, this is something that we can change and we are going to change it. And if you do not have that kind of public and voter pressure, it is not going to change from the inside. So you still have faith in the [NORP] public and [NORP] democracy and momentum, and just to be clear there are no black helicopters correct? There are. There are black helicopters but we generally do not deploy them. Ok. Ok. Alright. We deploy them against [PERSON] for example, but we generally do not deploy them on [GPE] soil. Right. But cause like I ask myself when I knew I was talking to you and I see somebody who symbolically- that that horrible event, he had an agenda, it was a symbolic event, he knew what he was doing and he knew where he was doing it, he knew what it meant. And now he is confessed by saying he wanted to start a race war. Right In my mind it is like where do you find hope without that ever stopping. And is it in the people? It is in the people and I tell you, people ask me what is -what is the thing you have learned most as president- Right, yeah. -and I tell them I do not know if this is something I have learned but it is something that has been confirmed. The [NORP] people are overwhelmingly good, decent, generous people. And I can say that because I meet with a lot of people and during this journey that you take from the time you start running for president to [DATE] being president, you see folks from all walks of life. Yeah. You do not just talk to your supporters, you meet people who do not like you, did not vote for you. You go to areas that are, you know in [DATE]'s parlance, red states- Right. -and are considered very conservative and you talk to people-and everybody that I meet believes in a lot of the same things. They believe in some of the same virtues I was talking about that my mom taught me. They believe in honesty and family and community and looking out for one another. They very rarely think in terms of that is a [NORP] so I do not like that person or that is a [NORP] so I do not like that person. That-that is not how folks organize their lives. So that always gives me hope and always gives me confidence when I see how [NORP] interact with each other on a day to day basis. The problem is, is that there is this big gap between who we are as a people and how our politics expresses itself. And part of that has to do with gerrymandering and super-packs and lobbyists and a media that is so splintered now, that we are not in a common conversation. And the fact that if you watch [ORG] you inhabit a completely different world with different facts than if you read [ORG]... Right, you can cherry pick facts and information to fit your ideology. And then that becomes self reenforcing and there is a profit, both for politicians and for [ORG] outlets in simplifying and polarizing. And so all of those things have combined to make our political institutions detached from how people live on a day to [DATE] basis. And that is part of why people get so frustrated and they get so cynical, but ironically you get a negative feedback loop right, when people start thinking that what is happening in [GPE] is so distant from how I see things that I am not even going to bother to vote. Or even listen. Or I am not even going to bother to listen. And as a consequence then, the public withdraws and you get an even worse political gridlock and polarization. So the issue is not the [NORP] people, that is where my faith is. The question is how do we build institutions and connections that allow the goodness, decency, and common sense of ordinary folks to express itself in the decisions that are made about how the country moves forward. Well it is interesting that people have lost faith and I think that what your speaking to is-I had this weird experience with a guy, I did a show in [GPE] and in the next theater right over was [PERSON] and [PERSON]. And after the show I was talking to a guy, you know a [GPE] vet, and we were just sitting outside smoking a cigar and he was having a cigarette and he was from the south. He said he just went and saw the show, but I did not tell him who I was, I did not discuss politics at all I just let that go, and I knew that in that moment that if I had brought up politics, there would have been nothing but tension, nothing but fighting. Right. And I did not want to do it, but because I did not I got to know who that guy was. Right So I think some of what you are speaking to is that like I think you are right that most [NORP]'s are decent people with these core values but if you get [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] of them with same ideology feeding a certain amount of hate on either side then the individual does not come through. I think that is right. And that is why I think so many people shy away from politics because they know-look if I am going to my kids soccer game and I am just with a bunch of dads- Yeah - and we are talking about sports- Yeah -and we are talking about housing prices and we are just talking about how we are living our lives, then everybody is finding all kinds of commonalities. And yet the minute you introduce [NORP], [NORP], [INTERVIEWED1]- Yeah - [PERSON], suddenly people start breaking apart. And then the question then becomes how do you break out of that pattern and that is something I have spent a lot of time with over [DATE]. I have spent a lot of time just on policy and trying to get stuff right. You know, how do we make sure that we create more jobs, how do we make sure that when I first came in, how do I prevent another Great Depression. How do I make sure folks have healthcare. But increasingly I have spent my time thinking about how do I try to break out of these old patterns- Yeah -that our politics has fallen into. Which is part of the reason why I am here, I mean I will be honest with you. One of the things that I have had conversations with my communications team about is-is how do we talk to folks who are not already so dug in into a particular way of thinking about politics that we can create more space for people to have a normal ordinary conversation. And one in which the lines are not as clearly drawn black and white, and it is not this, you know, battling in a steel cage- Right. - between one side and another. Well I became sort of disillusioned. I mean I used to do you know left wing talk radio and I realized that there was a lot of things I was naive about. You know, about just exactly how the government worked. Yeah. And then there are certain trajectories around war- Yeah -and around education and around you know the sort of corporate occupation of the [NORP] government. Right. You know, you start to have those conversations and it becomes very hard to deny that some of that is true. Yeah And you know I imagine from what I see in thinking about your presidency and thinking about you is there is an element-and I do not know if this will be insulting to you-there is an element to the presidency that is sort of middle management. Yeah. And that it seems to me that you knew going in what you were up against. Because I have read your early work and you knew how it laid out. Right. You knew how capitalism worked. Right. You knew how-you knew that there was no-you cannot go in like you know we cannot live in a white man's world. Those color lines had to be scraped. Right. But also you knew the realities of business. Right. So it seems to me that in thinking about that middle management frame that you knew the game you had to play but you knew that you had to, I think left to its own devices, sadly the government is only going to ceed so much to poor people. Well, you know what, here is another way of putting it. Ok. But-but I think you are on to something. You know when I ran in [DATE], Yeah. Right. there were those posters out there-hope. And change- and those are capturing aspirations about where we should be going. Yeah A society that is more just, a society that is more equal, a society in which the dignity of every individual is respected. A society of tolerance- Yeah. - a society of opportunity. And the question then is how do the operation lines those abstract concepts into something really concrete. You know how do we get someone a job, how do we improve a school, how do we make sure that everybody gets decent healthcare. As soon as you start specifics then the world's complicated. Yeah. And there are choices that you have got to make and it turns out that the trajectory of progress always happens in fits and starts. You have got these big legacy systems that you have got to wrestle with- Yeah - and you have to balance what you want and where you are going with what is and what has been. And [CARDINAL] of the interesting things is that the conversations I have with supporters who will say to me You know we think you are a great guy, you have done some great things, but I am so disappointed with X, cause X did not happen exactly the way I wanted it. And what I have to explain to them is that progress in a democracy- Yeah -is never instantaneous and it is always partial and you cannot get cynical or frustrated just because you did not get all the way there immediately. So during the healthcare debate there were a lot of people who just wanted a single payer plan. Right. Right. And as I said before, if I were designing the system from scratch, that would probably make more sense. We are the only country on earth-not the only country on earth but we are one of the few countries that has this weird amalgam of private sector and medicare and sort of a patchwork system, hugely inefficient. We spend more than any of the other advanced countries, our outcomes are not necessarily better. But the notion that we were just going to scrap the existing healthcare system which is a sixth of our economy, it employs [CARDINAL] of people and-that was not going to happen. Right. So the question is alright, given where we are starting now, how do we move as best we can in the right direction? [DATE], we have got [CARDINAL] of people who have healthcare who did not have it before we have the lowest uninsured rate that has ever been recorded. But for a lot of people they are looking at it and saying Well, we did not get everything we wanted. For me, what I say to myself is, for those [CARDINAL] of people, many of whom write to me and say You saved my life, that is democracy working, that is government working. The same is true when it comes to how we think about the fight against terrorism. You know, we ended [CARDINAL] wars but I always said from the start that there really are people out there who would have no compunction about just blowing up an entire neighborhood of [NORP], innocent men women and children- Yeah. -for ideological reasons. We have to deal with that. And that then means that we do have to be able to identify those networks. We do have to, when we can find those folks- Yeah. -try to prevent them from doing what they are doing. And so for [DATE] I have tried to do is to build up a legal structure that is consistent with our values and due process build up a intelligence system that is consistent with our civil liberties. Yeah. And sometimes my supporters will write and say, You know there is some stuff that you are doing that is just like [PERSON]. And what I explain to them is the problems with the excesses of our counter terrorism approach after 9/11 were real. And waterboarding and torture and renditions- Right. -we stopped but that does not mean that we do not have real problems are not there and there are not balances that we have got to strike and figure out. And it is complicated and we have got to be mindful that whatever abstract views you have about drones or that you have about intelligence gathering, that if you were sitting there in the situation room you'd realize that you have got some responsibilities and you have got some choices to make. And it is not all you know- Clearcut - clearcut the way often times it gets presented. So I guess to go to the point you were making earlier, that is where you know yeah it is like middle management. Sometimes your job is just to make stuff work. Sometimes the task of government is to make incremental improvements or try to steer the ocean liner [CARDINAL] degrees- Right. -north or south so that [DATE] suddenly we are in a very different place than we were, but at the time-but at the moment, people may feel that we need a [QUANTITY] turn, not a [QUANTITY] turn. And you say well, if I turn [QUANTITY] the whole ship turns. They were not going to let you turn [QUANTITY]. And you cannot turn [QUANTITY]. Right And not- Shock to the system. -and its not just because of corporate lobbyists, it is not just because of big money. It is because societies do not turn [QUANTITY]. Democracies certainly do not turn [QUANTITY]. And that is been true on issues of race, that is been true on issues of the environment, it is true on issues of discrimination. As long as they are turing in the right direction- Right. that we are making progress- Right -then government is working sort of the way it is supposed to. But it is very optimistic of you. I am an optimistic guy. [laughter] I am. I mean like just the way you are -cause I do not know how you deal from day to day, I was panicking [TIME]. I do not imagine you were flying in here on the chopper thinking you know like I am nervous about [PERSON]. No I was not . Ok well that is good. That makes...[laughter] That would be a problem. That would be a problem! If the president was feeling stressed about- About coming to my garage -coming to your garage. But you deal with that stuff- For a podcast.. -all the time I mean like you are saying it is incremental progress but I mean you had a congress that was dead set on not giving you anything. Right. And then you know then it got to a point where even if they wanted to work with you they could not because their constituents... That is exactly right. They had their constituencies all stirred up. They thought you were [PERSON]. Right So you had that obstacle. Right And then you are coming into a country that was depleted. Right. And it is fascinating to me that you are even able to maintain this hope. And then again on [DATE] when this post [ORG]'s gonna make a decision about your bill-the healthcare bill. I mean that is a huge thing, this is a slightly very crazy case... That should not have been taken in my view. But it could dismantle your-your big thing. The thing that you gave everybody. Well a couple things I will observe. Number [CARDINAL]: not to get into the weeds on this- Well, yeah. - but first of all, I am confident we will win because the law is clearly on our side. Number [CARDINAL]: the case at issue is not whether the entire Affordable Care Act is legal. Right. It is a very narrow statutory interpretation about whether those states that did not set up state exchanges but who is people are benefiting from subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, whether they still get those subsidies. If [ORG] were to decide against us, [CARDINAL] people could lose their health insurance. Immediately. Well, they- who knows what they said. But people in [GPE] where there is a state exchange, or [GPE], they would not lose it. Right. All the benefits that have happened for people who already had health insurance-not being discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition, making sure that women are not having to pay more than men then insurance- those things would not go away. Right. But look, are there frustrations in my job? Yes. On the other hand I can say unequivocally I can answer [PERSON] question unequivocally Are you better off now than you were [DATE]? Right. And the answer is on every economic measure just about we are. Right. So when I take an unemployment rate from [PERCENT] down to [PERCENT], when I drive the uninsured rate to the lowest it is ever been, when I restore people's poor 01 case, when I make sure that we are doubling clean energy and we are reducing our carbon footprint and high school graduation is the highest it is ever been and college attendance is the highest they have ever been- And civil rights elements too. -and LGBT rights have been recognized and solidified in ways that we could not even imagine [DATE]. When I look at those things, I can say that in terms of not just managing the government but moving the country forward, we have had a lot more hits than misses. And we have made a difference in people's lives. And that is ultimately what you are looking for. You know when you wake up [DATE] you say to yourself, Are things a little bit better? Yeah. And if you take that long view, than you are less nervous or stressed about the day to day ups and downs and what is in politico [DATE] or what are my poll numbers doing or what did such and such say about me. And you kind of start to just block that stuff out because you are staying focused on your ultimate destination. You can just walk it out, obviously. You have to. I have learned not to worry about the day to [DATE] and to stay focused on what I need to do for the [NORP] people long term. And look, some of it is temperament. You know, I always say part of this is just being born in [GPE], it is really nice. I was just there, in [GPE]. Yeah, you feel better. Yeah! So I feel like that fortified me. I just, you know, there is a certain element of chill. You got a little [NORP] in the mind You got a little [NORP] in the mind. And that is part of it. But do not you get furious? I mean I saw you on TV [DATE] and I could see the anger and you are not a boil over kind of guy- No - but I could feel it. Yeah. There are times-I will tell you right after Sandy Hook in [GPE] when [DATE] are gunned down, and [ORG] literally does nothing...yeah that-that is the closest I came to feeling disgusted. I was pretty disgusted. But-but the that is the exception rather than the rule. In the sense that on most fronts I have been able to find ways to make progress even in the face of obstruction, even in the face of resistance, even in the face of gridlock. So on climate change for example- Right. -Congress has not acted. Right On the other hand, just through rule making we were able to double fuel efficiency standards on cars. We met right in the middle of putting together a rule to reduce carbon pollution from power plants and we will get that stuff done. And it would be a lot better, it'd be a lot more helpful if we had some cooperation from [ORG] and if I did not have the chairman of [ORG] in the [ORG] holding up a snowball as if that was proof that climate change was not happening. Right. [laughter] That would be useful. So that kind of-but does, cause you are a smart guy, you are a results oriented guy. Yeah. and you see yourself as a practical person which you are and that the stuff that you are talking about should make sense to everybody. Yeah. And that is the way you approach these guys who are like No! Yeah I am a-look some of the mythology about me of being being very professorial and removed, that stuff is actually, I think it has to do with me not schmoozing enough in [GPE] cause I got [CARDINAL] kids. Right And it is true that I do not do the cocktail circuit and some of the... You do not play the game in that way. But the truth is though, it is accurate to say that I believe in reason. Ok. And I believe in facts. Right. And I believe in looking at something and having a debate and an argument, but trying to drive it towards some agreed upon set of assumptions about what works and what does not . So if you want to argue with me that it is better off if we cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires- I do not mind you putting that forward as an argument but if I then present to you a set of facts that shows that that does not result in higher economic growth, but in fact when we have a more equitable tax system, that is when everybody's benefiting and that is when we grow. And I can show you charts decade by decade of when we grew fastest and what worked. And the fact that your theories have generally have not worked- Yeah -my expectation is that at some point- Yeah. - you say Ok... Yeah. That makes sense. ...that makes sense to me. Right And that is where there are times where it is frustrating because the public has-look, it is hard for the public to follow this stuff- Yeah. -not because they do not get it. but because they have their lives to lead. They are working, you are trying to get your kids to school. They just want to be ok. They want things to be ok. And they are not going to be able to follow the intricacies of the healthcare debate so if someone is going around saying death panels- Yeah. -they start to think, I do not like the idea of death panels, that does not sound good. And so [CARDINAL] of the challenges that I have had to adapt to, and this is where hopefully I have gotten better as president- Yeah. - cause you know, you learn as you go along, is to recognize that it is not enough to be right or to get policy right, it is also important to be able to communicate in a way that is digestible, easily enough for the public that you can move the needle of public opinion and sometimes it is just a matter of you being able to get enough folks in [ORG] who share your views to have the votes to get stuff done. Yeah And you can talk all you want- Right - but you are not going to change the other side's mind, you just have to go ahead and see if you can move forward because they are resistant to, in some cases, rational fact-based arguments. So-alright you have got an amazing amount of stuff done and in time in [DATE] you had a lot of stuff done there were people who were thinking you were not getting anything done, and now this horrible thing happens [DATE] and you have you know these police actions in [GPE] and [GPE]. I mean where-coming from where you came from and you know trying to define yourself in terms of the [NORP] community- Right. -in terms of racial relations, where are we with that in term of when you came in in your mind? Well first of all, I always tell young people in particular, do not say that nothing's changed when it comes to race in [GPE] unless you have lived through being a black man in [DATE] or [DATE] or [DATE]. It is incontrovertible that race relations have improved significantly during my life time and yours. And that opportunities have opened up and that attitudes have changed. Yeah. That is a fact. What is also true is that the legacy of slavery, [PERSON], discrimination, in almost every institution in our lives-you know that casts a long shadow and that is still part of our DNA that is past on. We are not cured of it. Racism. Racism, we are not cured of. Clearly. And-and it is not just a matter of, it not being polite to say nigger in public, that is not the measure of whether racism still exists or not. It is not just a matter of overt discrimination. We have to-societies do not over [TIME] completely erase everything that happen [DATE]. And so what I tried to describe in the Selma speech that I gave commemorating Yeah. - the march there was again a notion that progress is real and we have to take hope from that progress, but what is also real is that the march is not over, and the work is not yet completed. And then our job is to try in very concrete ways to figure out what more can we do. So let us take the example of police practices; cops have a really tough job. Yep. And part of the reason cops have a tough job particularly in big cities is that there are communities that are poor, are systematically locked out of opportunity, that suffer from legacies of discrimination that have been built up over generations and we send cops in there basically to say keep those folks from making too much trouble. But how do we fix what you just said? Right well, I am going to get to that. So the point is though, that we can break it out into these component parts and we can say number [CARDINAL], there is specific ways that we can make police-community relations better and make police more accountable. Right, yeah. And so we put together a task force with police officers and young people, including some of the people who lead the Ferguson marches, and surprisingly they came up with a consensus of things that could be done that would make things better. Alright, so lets implement those. Now, in the mean time what are we doing to help those lowest income communities? We know that, for example, early childhood education works. That is [CARDINAL] way to break the legacy of racism and poverty. If a [DATE], [DATE] kid is in an environment of love and is getting a good meal- Right - and has a teacher that is trained in early childhood development and is hearing enough words and is being engaged enough, they can get to where a middle class kid is pretty quickly. Is that happening? It is but the problem is is that it happens spottily. Right? It happens in this community or this school district or this neighborhood or this outstanding principal is making something happen. Or this philanthropist has decided- decided to do something. But what has not happened is us making a collective commitment to do it. So the point I am making is that when you look at how to deal with racism- Mmhm - how to deal with issues of some of the police shootings that have been involved, I am less interested in having an ideological conversation than I am looking at what has worked in the past- Mmhm - and applying it and scaling up. What is required is a sense on the part of all of us that what happens to those kids matters to me even if I never meet them because my society is going to be better off. I am going to feel better about the [GPE] I live in and overtime I am confident that my children and my grandchildren are going to live a better life if those kids also have opportunity. That is where we have to feel hopeful, rather than just say nothing's changed, we have to say Wow we have actually made significant progress over [DATE], if we made as much progress over [DATE] as we have over [DATE], things would be better. And that is within our grasp it is available to us. Yeah And this is where again you want to get to those decent, well meaning [NORP] who would agree with that but when it gets translated into politics, it gets all confused. And trying to bridge that gap I think between the good impulses of the overwhelming majority of [NORP] and how our politics expresses itself continues to be the biggest challenge. What do you do to have fun? I mean like I cannot imagine what it is like to raise a family in this situation that you are in as president, it must feel sort of insulated. You know the biggest fun I have had is watching my girls grow up. Yeah And they are-they are magnificent. Look, hopefully every parent feels the way I feel about my daughters. Yeah. But I think they are spectacular and when [PERSON] and I came into office, the biggest worry we had was is this going to be some weird thing for them and are they gonna grow up with an attitude or are they going to think everybody eats off of [GPE]? Right. Right And... Are they? [laughter] And you know it turns out that they just become-they are kind, they are thoughtful, they treat everybody with respect, they do not have any kind of airs They are confident but without being cocky. Mmhm. They have got great friends. They have been able to-you know they are not stuck in the bubble the same way I am. Mmhm. You know they go to the mall, they have sleep overs, they go to prom. [PERSON] is starting to drive. You know they are doing great. So my biggest fun has been watching them grow up. Now unfortunately they are now hitting the age where they still love me, but they think I am completely boring. Yeah. And so they will come in, pat me on the head, talk to me for [TIME] and then they are gone [DATE]. And they break my heart. So now I have got to start thinking, well what is going to replace that fun? Right, well the [CARDINAL] thing you do not have to worry about, is like I hope they do not get lost. That never happens. Right. I mean what is true you know is sometimes, [PERSON] for example- Yeah. - she got older and was starting to chafe a little bit about secret service and I had to explain to her, [PERSON], let me tell you something. If you think that you'd be over at your friend's house until [TIME], and then I'd be coming to pick you up, you are crazy. Right So the only reason you are out is because you have a detail, otherwise you'd be home, because I would not be chauffeuring you around. So there is a balance of that stuff. You know I have been trying to work out pretty hard just to stay in shape that is useful. But it is not-you know I used to play basketball more but [DATE] I- I have gotten to the point to where it is not as much fun because I am not as good as I used to be and I get frustrated. You get-because you play for real. Yeah I used to be. I was never great but I was a good player and I could play seriously and now I am one of those old guys who is running around... you know the guys who I'd play with who are a lot younger, they sort of pity me and sympathize with me. They tolerate me but, you know, we all know I am the weak link- Yeah - on the court and I do not like being the weak link. Right Yeah And psychologically in terms of-of where you come from and your family, you know the revelations that you grew to have about your father overtime, and you know, did you find yourself confronting in yourself the same challenges that your father did you know with-with stubbornness, you know with dealing with you know alcohol and that kind of stuff? You know, I was lucky in that sense. For those who are listening who have not read my book, my dad was a tragic figure in a lot of ways. A brilliant man by all accounts- Uh huh -who sort of took a leap from a tiny village in the back waters of [GPE] to suddenly [GPE], getting a degree, attending [ORG]. And he never managed that leap as well as he could have. And I-and part of the process of me writing the book was to figure out what happened to him and how did he become who he was. You know he ended up becoming an alcoholic and abusive towards his several wives and to some degree a neglectful father. In some ways because I did not grow up with him- Yeah. - he was an abstraction to me. Right. That stuff did not steep into me. You know, my mother and my grandparents who did raise me, fortified me. Although, [CARDINAL] thing that they always did that I thought was wise- Yeah. -was they never portrayed a negative picture of him. They actually accentuated what was good about him rather than bad. Which is an interesting thing. And you had to do your own homework. [laughter] I had to do my own homework but the point is though is that I did not end up... It was a good myth. Yeah it was a good myth. And I did not internalize a bunch of negative attitudes about who he was and thereby did not think that that was who I had to be. So, you know I had the adolescent rebellion, screw up period that has been well chronicled. Yeah But it turned out that a lot of his craziness, I did not end up internalizing it. You know one of the things I always say-I have said this to [PERSON]-one of our biggest jobs as parents, cause we are all a little bit crazy, is lets see if we can not pass on any of our craziness to any of our kids. Right. That is the challenge, right. Yeah. And let us see if we can break the cycle. How are you crazy? Well, for example, I think that having grown up the way I did without a dad, moving around a lot, my mom sometimes gone- Yeah -because of the nature of her work, it was very important to me to be a good dad. And part of, I think, the attraction to [PERSON] originally, in addition to her being really good looking and smart and tough and funny, was she had this opposite experience growing up. I mean it was really Leave It to Beaver. You know, dad, mom, brother, living in the same place for her entire childhood, family everywhere. And so-so she helped ground me in a way that allowed my kids to have this base for themselves that I never had. Conversely, I think [PERSON] would be the first to admit that part probably of her attraction to me was that her living in the same place all her life in this very traditional sense sometimes made her less adventurous and less open to doing new things. Mmhm And so she has seen me as a way to instill in our kids this willingness to take a flyer on something. Try it out. Sure Do something new. You know, in that sense each of us I think had been really mindful about trying to make sure that whatever limitations or gaps we have got that we are having the other person help fill those gaps at least for our children. And [CARDINAL], I know we have got to finish up here in a [TIME] or [CARDINAL], but you know when [PERSON] says would you stop that please, what is she talking about? [crosstalk] Well, I mean there is being late... Do you isolate-like for some reason I see you as a guy that is sort of like in your head and just sort of like, will detach a little bit. No, no I am very engaged, that is not-she will say stop that when we first started dating. And I'd always give myself kind of a [TIME] leeway- Right - in terms of showing up. Ok. And getting to stuff. Partly because [PERSON]'s dad had Multiple Sclerosis. It is really interesting, I used to say Why are you stressing me about being late? I am [TIME] or [TIME] late, what is the big deal? Right And then, I do not remember how long we were in the relationship when she described how her dad had to wake up [TIME] than everybody else, because he had Multiple Sclerosis, just to put on his shirt and button his own shirt was a big task. Right. And if the family wanted to go see [PERSON]'s brother play basketball, this is before the ADA-the American Disability Act, you know they'd have to get there early so that her dad on crutches could hobble his way up the stairs to their seat. And that mentality of not wanting to stand out and not wanting to, you know, miss something had been instilled in her. So it was very emotional thing. It was loaded, it was not just about being late. It was not just about being late. So, that is one of the beauties of marriage. If it works, that is when you start figuring out-you know the fights you have are never about the fights. It is never about the thing you are fighting about. It is always about something else. It is about a story, it is about respect, recognition. Something deep. Yeah something deep. Yeah. Yeah, and you know... So ok, so I think we did good here. Yeah I thought it was a pretty good conversation. What could I have done better? What did I not do? Were you expecting something a little lighter? No, no we-its just that we sort of dove in, it did not have that sort of nice, ease into it. Suddenly we were just... In it? That is sort of just the way I am. You know, intense. That is what I figured. So I went with it. I rolled with it. How do you do this, you know you just say well-I saw you in [GPE] [DATE] after your grandmother passed [DATE] before the election, and you just turned it on. They-you know, you were just doing gigs [TIME]. You are going to [PERSON] and [PERSON] doing the thing. You are touring, doing that part of the job. You know [TIME] of-you know I am a comic-so the night that you knew they were going to shoot [PERSON] you are doing comedy. I was pretty funny too. Yeah. Yeah. But you know, is there some trick that you can share with us all on how you just sort of focus in on that? Is everything that immediate to you that you can compartmentalize that quickly, or do you just know that you have to show up and do the job? Yeah, look because you are a performer you know this is true and you are friends with a lot of comics... You like comedy? I love comedy. Who are your guys? Well [PERSON] was an early one. [PERSON] when he was really you know on the edge. Yeah But you know what, I love all-Seinfeld's a whole other different type. Yeah. [PERSON] I know is a buddy of yours. Yeah [PERSON]. Yeah I think [PERSON]'s terrific. Oh boy you just made his life. You made his life. No, he is wonderful in such a self deprecating- Yeah - but edgy kind of way and basically good hearted even when he is saying stuff that is pretty, you know- Wrong. -wrong yeah. But you can-there is a goodness about him that comes through. But look I think that, I think at the end, what all those guys understand is the more you do something and the more you practice it, at a certain point it becomes second nature. Sure. And-and what I have always been impressed about by when I have listened to comics talk about comedy is how much of it is a craft. Right Right? And they are thinking it through. They have a sense of when it works and when it does not and that the longer you do it the better you are instincts are. Same with the president. Yeah, same with And also-I guess the last thing is you lose-you lose fear. That is right. I was talking to somebody [DATE] about why I actually think I am -I am a better president and would be a better candidate if I were running again than I ever have been. It is sort of like an athlete, you might slow down a little bit , you might not jump as high- Right. - as you used to, but I know what I am doing and I am fearless. For real, you are not pretending to be fearless. Right, yeah you are not pretending to be fearless. That is exactly it, right. And when you get to that point... Freedom. Then yeah, you know- and also part of that fearlessness is because you have screwed up enough times- Sure -that you know, that... It is all happened. It is all happened. I have been through this. Right I have screwed up. Right I have been in the barrel tumbling down Niagra Falls. Yeah. And I emerged and I lived. And that is always-that is such a liberating feeling. Absolutely. Right? Yeah. It is one of the benefits of-of age. It almost compensates for the fact that I cannot play basketball anymore. Well good, thank you. It was great to talk to you. Very good, we are good? That was fun. I appreciate it [INTERVIEWED1], it was great. Alright [PERSON].", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsnygovandrewcuomopressconferencetranscriptjanuary4", "text": "Hi, [INTERVIEWED1], a couple things here. [CARDINAL] on vaccines. On the [CARDINAL] hand you are telling hospitals to use their lot by [DATE] or face a fine, but on the other hand, you are telling them if they mess up the prioritization, they can also face a fine. Are those competing principles there? And is that in any way, slowing down the vaccination process? And then my second question is about the Finger Lakes and the Mohawk Valley. You are telling them to take extra precautions, but why are not you imposing any additional restrictions in those areas if they are being hit harder than the rest of the state? Yeah. [PERSON], just stay with me. I did not hear the second part of the first question. You have [CARDINAL] fine for hospitals that do not use up their allotment [DATE]. You have another fine for people who- [DATE], you have another fine for people who mess up the prioritization or administered to people who are not supposed to be getting the vaccine right now. Are those competing principles? And is that slowing down the vaccination process at all? I got it, I am sorry, I got it. First, the hospitals have been given the vaccines for expeditious administration. If you have been given an allocation and you have only used [CARDINAL] of the allocation, then you should not have the allocation. We have options, [PERSON], you have some hospitals that are doing [PERCENT] of the allocation. [PERCENT] of the allocation. They are much better at administering. I want to get needles in the arms and I want to get that done as quickly as possible. If there are some hospitals that are better at doing that, then they should be doing that. If you cannot do that within [DATE], then just raise your hand and say, I cannot do this. Fine, we will go to a different hospital. We know what hospitals are better at administering it. I'd rather have the faster hospitals administering it. The fine, and if you can administer it, if your hospital does not have the capacity, then just say that. But do not say as a hospital, I can administer it, but then do not . That is why you would be fined. You would be fined for accepting an allocation that you cannot administer or will not administer. You should just say, I do not want to participate in the program, which is fine, and then we will give it to a different hospital. The second, Fine, that is not a mistake, [PERSON]. I want to pass a criminal law to that effect. Criminal law is intent. It is not a mistake. It is not that you were defrauded. It is you engaged knowingly in a criminal act. You sold the vaccines because you could make money. I came to you and I said, Look, I am not eligible, but I want to skip ahead to the line. And I am willing to pay you for that. That is a crime. I am talking about criminal conduct, not a mistake or not that you were defrauded. If a hospital said, Look, they gave me a phony driver's license. And they told me they were [DATE], but they were not . I was defrauded, fine. I am talking about the opposite. I am talking about an affirmative fraud using this vaccine. You will, mark my words, you are going to see fraud in this vaccine. You are going to see people selling the vaccine. We are already investigating cases of fraud. It is valuable, it is money, and you will see fraud. And before it even starts, I want to say to people, I understand the possibility of this. And I understand this is a valuable commodity. And by the way, it is going to become more valuable when people say, I really want it and I want to get ahead of the line. So that would be criminal. The main spread is now coming from social gatherings. I have said everything that I can say, we have closed and regulated every outlet that we can regulate. Some people mocked me, made a little picture of me looking in the window of a house that I was so intrusive that I was looking into your home to see how many people you had at a social gathering. The [ORG] has said no more than your immediate household. The state has said no more than [CARDINAL]. I talk about it every time I am here, [PERSON], but over [PERCENT] of the spread is coming from people's social activities. And everything short of that, we have regulated. The only place to go over that is a hospital capacity becomes problematic. Then we go to full shut down and that is a red zone. And the Finger Lakes, Mohawk Valley, you see that number [PERCENT] availability. If that infection rate does not come down, you will see the hospital capacity diminishing, and then you will see the region shut down. That number keeps going up at that level, you will see the hospital capacity number come down, you will see the region shutdown. That is what they are looking at. It is math. You can predict the future here because it is just the extrapolation of an equation. You continue at that hospitalization rate. You will reduce the hospital capacity and you will go to a red zone. That is what the Finger Lakes in Mohawk Valley are looking at. Next question, operator. [INTERVIEWED1], your next question comes from [INTERVIWER2] from spectrum news. [PERSON], your line is now open. Please unmute your microphone. How are you [INTERVIWER2]? Good [TIME] [INTERVIEWED1], how are you? Good [TIME]. I was wondering what is the refusal rate right now with the vaccine among healthcare workers and nursing home residents and staff? Do you know how many people have refused right now to take the vaccine? We do not know. I will ask [INTERVIEWED2] and Dr Not doctor, well, he is technically a doctor, he is a lawyer, he is technically doctor, but I do not call him doctor. Because then I would be a doctor too. [INTERVIEWED3]. We know the percent, the successful percent that most hospitals have administered of their allocation. We do not have a definitive breakdown of staff who did not get it versus staff who would not take it. We have anecdotal, we do not have hard numbers, but I would ask [INTERVIEWED2] and [PERSON], we will call him [INTERVIEWED3], [INTERVIEWED3] if he knows anything beyond that. Thank thank you [INTERVIEWED1]. And as the [INTERVIEWED1] mentioned, we have some anecdotal evidence from the hospitals, but primarily with our nursing homes, we were saying we have some more data on that. It is [PERCENT] of the residents and [PERCENT] of the staff. The healthcare workers were pushing very hard and they are also pushing to get everyone vaccinated. That is the critical thing to do for them, but I do not have a specific number for the whole healthcare system unless [PERSON] does. I have nothing more to add, that is good. Nothing else, [INTERVIEWED3]? Next question, [SPEAKER]. [INTERVIEWED1], your next question comes from [INTERVIEWER3] from [ORG] in [GPE]. [INTERVIEWER3], your line is now open. Please unmute your microphone. Hi [INTERVIEWED1], how are you? [DATE]. [DATE], [PERSON]. How are you doing? Good, thank you, sir. Could you help me understand better, the release from the press office [DATE] said the percent of hospital beds available in the central [GPE] region is [PERCENT]. Your slide obviously [DATE] said that that central [GPE] was at [PERCENT]. So is there a difference I am not understanding there? Because [PERCENT] has a lot of us concerned that more restrictions are coming. The number you saw [DATE] and I asked [INTERVIEWED3] to comment on this, the number you saw [DATE] is what that hospital could surge to in [DATE]. So you have It is a little complicated, but it is a good question. I want to make sure we all understand it. You have, what is your availability [DATE], hospital? What is your surge capacity for staffed beds within [DATE]? Meaning you could have [PERCENT] [DATE]. What can you add within [DATE] and what would your capacity be? What would your capacity be in [DATE]? We even asked what could your capacity be in [DATE]? So you can have a [CARDINAL] bed hospital and I can have [CARDINAL] people in those beds, so I have a [PERCENT] capacity, but I also have an ambulatory center and I can close the ambulatory center and I can make those hospital beds, but that would take me [DATE]. So then I could give you [CARDINAL] number for [DATE], but I have capacity to make some changes and add beds. And that is the [DATE] surge. You give me a little more time as a hospital, I could hire more staff and I'd have a [DATE] surge capacity that is a little greater. So you have capacity [DATE], your ability to surge and add, which is either beds or staff, or sometimes both, in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. But [PERSON], do you want to comment on that? Yes, the [INTERVIEWED1] is exactly right. The information the hospital gives the state [DATE], this number of staff to acute care beds that are currently available. It is a number we watch very, very closely. We have watched the rate of hospital admissions, what the growth rate is, and we can project that out. And then what can you build within [DATE]? Again, acute care, staffed beds. It is an important metric to be able to know that these hospitals can provide the type of care to a certain number of patients over a period of time. So the [INTERVIEWED1] is exactly right in the way he described it. Okay, [SPEAKER], next question. Anyone want to add anything? Correct anything? Misstatements, misfacts, miscues, misinterpretation? [SPEAKER]. [INTERVIEWED1], your next question comes from [INTERVIEWER4] from [ORG]. [PERSON], your line is now open. Please unmute your microphone. Hey [INTERVIEWED1], can you hear me? Yes, sir [INTERVIEWER4] happy [DATE]. [DATE] to you as well. So you said something sort of ominous that [DATE] will be the start of the state of the state. Can you give us any more details? Are we looking at [CARDINAL] speech? Will it be done virtually? Just because obviously you do not want to have a super spreader event. What are we looking at for state of the state? [INTERVIEWED1] is super spreader, now that would be a story. [INTERVIEWED1] super spreader state of the state. It should not be ominous, first of all, [PERSON]. It should be intriguing. Look this is [DATE] and there will be no crowd. So virtual, whatever you call this, but obviously you cannot bring a together. There is no crowd, so you do not have a convention center, you do not have [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] people in the convention center, but actually you have many more people paying attention to these types of communications than we ever did before for the state of the state. We have [CARDINAL] of viewers on this, but it will be different. And this is also a different kind of state, not just in the mechanism, but this is going to be a different state of the state because it is [DATE] for the state and we have more to do so I will leave it at that for now because I want to have a little suspense, not ominous. It is going to be good. I know you love to listen to my speeches and remarks, [PERSON]. So it is going to be very good. Question please, operator. Your next question comes from [INTERVIEWER5] from [ORG]. [INTERVIEWER5], your line is now open. Please unmute your microphone. How are you [INTERVIEWER5]? Yeah, hi [INTERVIEWED1], given what you were just saying to [PERSON] earlier on the zones, how should we think about the micro cluster zones going forward? There has not really been much change over [DATE], either in terms of taking zones away or shrinking them or adding new ones. I know here in [GPE], we are hearing from a lot of restaurant owners and other business owners that are affected by the restrictions that are wondering where things are going, when things might be lifted, or whether more restrictions are coming. I guess I am just curious for an update on how we should think about that at the moment. Well, [INTERVIEWER5], think about it this way. The question [CARDINAL], reduced restrictions. To reduce restrictions, you would have to see a reduced rate. Why would you reduce See a reduced rate. Why would you reduce restrictions when you see the rate increasing? What you are seeing is despite the restrictions, the rate is increasing. Experts will tell you, and I believe, without the restrictions, it would be increasing faster. If the rate continues to increase, you are going to run into a hospital capacity issue. That is a function of math. When you run into a hospital capacity issue, then we have to close down the economy. And [INTERVIEWER5], Well, we do not want to close down the economy. That is terrible. It is terrible. It is. And yes, that is the last resort, but that is a function of our behavior. You know, the Finger Lakes, you see for [DATE] the numbers going up. You see the positivity rate go up. You see the hospitalization rate go up. You see the hospital capacity go down. That is going to lead you to a close-down. There is no alternative. So people are in control of their own destiny. This is not government. This is social behavior. [NORP] brought the COVID rate down. And if [NORP] are not careful, the COVID rate will go up. And we restricted everything we could. I am not going to reduce any restrictions in a region where it is still going up. And if it keeps going up and social gatherings are [PERCENT] of the cause, and they have pictures of me looking in the window and into people's homes, if the rate keeps going up, then you are going to reduce hospital capacity and it is going to be a red zone. [SPEAKER], let us take [CARDINAL] more question. [INTERVIEWED1], your last question comes from [INTERVIEWER6] from [ORG]. [INTERVIEWER6], your line is now open. Please unmute your microphone. Hi, [INTERVIEWED1]. Happy New Year. Happy New Year, [INTERVIEWER6]. So just wanted to get a little bit more details on sort of what the issue is right now with the hospitals in reaching the vaccination levels that you would like to see. Has it been the priority issue? Has it been people refusing to get the vaccines, or has it been sort of a supply chain cooling issue? And then how many vaccines have been administered in the state as of [DATE]? Okay. [CARDINAL], 000 vaccines have been administered. I have spoken to [CARDINAL] of hospitals. I may go to medical school after this experience. It is all of the above [INTERVIEWER6]. There is no one cause, but let us just remember what we are doing here. The federal government set guidance on prioritization of who should receive the first vaccines. We agreed with the federal prioritization on the top priority, what they call priority [CARDINAL], hence top priority. Priority [CARDINAL] is inarguable. It is all healthcare workers who come in contact with the public. Why? Because they are most likely to be infected because they are coming in contact with the public, and they are most likely to spread the infection because they come in contact with the public. And I am going to ask [INTERVIEWED2] to comment on this. Look, you are going to have a lot of people who I could argue are top priority. Police are top priority, bus drivers, subway operators, firefighters, right? But healthcare workers on the numbers come into contact with people and are most in a setting where they could get infected. The hospitals get the vaccines. They can store these vaccines, both the [ORG] and the [ORG], and they are responsible for administering. This is to their staff, to their staff. How are some hospitals at [PERCENT] and some hospitals at [PERCENT]? I have heard nothing besides the urgency and the management capacity and efficiency. They all have the storage capacity. Some are at [PERCENT]. Now, while some people will refuse to take it, some healthcare workers will refuse to take it, but that cannot be the issue because they are at [PERCENT]. They have healthcare workers who they have not reached yet. So even if you want to say a small percentage of healthcare workers will not take the vaccine, that is not where they are at. Now, it is [DATE] [DATE] and you could argue that, well, I am being very aggressive in trying to get the vaccine out the door quickly. I am. I am. I do not want the vaccine in a freezer. I want it in somebody's arm. So yes, I am being aggressive, but if some hospitals can get [PERCENT] out, you cannot explain the deviation [CARDINAL]. And I have not heard a good explanation that is anything other than within their own bureaucracy and their own administration within their own bureaucracy. Now, they will say to me, It is only been [DATE]. And for some hospitals, it depends on your calibration. You could argue that [DATE] is a short period of time. I think [DATE] is a long period of time. And also, [INTERVIEWER6], the hospital does not have to participate. If they do not want the pressure of doing it, I understand. Fine. Then just say, I do not want to participate, and then we will send it to another hospital in that area that will participate and can do the employees of that hospital plus their own employees. I do not have any problem with that. I do have a problem with a hospital saying they are going to participate, receiving a scarce vaccine, and not administering it. But I have not heard any explanation other than it is only been [DATE] and not everybody comes in [DATE] and people have different shifts. It is all the bureaucracy. It is bureaucracy. But [INTERVIEWED2], who happens to be a doctor and probably is more sympathetic to the hospitals and the bureaucracy than I am. See, I operate by the doctrine of constructive impatience, [INTERVIEWER6], constructive impatience. There is always reasons to go slow. There is always reasons why it has not gotten done, especially in government. Constructive impatience is I am impatient, but it is constructive. I am impatient that it has been [DATE] and the vaccines have not been administered. I am impatient. Well, that is a negative. No, I think it is constructive impatience. This is a matter of life and death. So yes, I am impatient, but I think it is constructive. [INTERVIEWED2]? Thank you, [INTERVIEWED1]. So I think part of this also is a sense of urgency, as the [INTERVIEWED1] mentioned. The hospitals that are sitting at [PERCENT], there is a sense of urgency within the hospital to move things forward. And having worked in the hospitals, when you feel there is a priority, you push and you move it forward. So those at the top end, obviously there is a sense of urgency there. On the other end of the spectrum, if you look there is [PERCENT], there is [PERCENT], [PERCENT]. So for example, in the [ORG] system, the Mayor runs an [ORG] system, the health and hospitals system. So they have [CARDINAL] 000 eligible employees. [CARDINAL] of them have been vaccinated. They have received [CARDINAL] 000, sorry, [CARDINAL] vaccines. So those other [CARDINAL] employees need to get vaccinated. There needs to be a sense of urgency there. And as the [INTERVIEWED1] mentioned, the issue is that those employees, whether it is in the system, the [ORG] system, or any of the other hospitals, they are the front-facing healthcare workers. They are sitting right opposite a patient who has a medical condition who, if they get COVID, are more likely to get ill, end up in the hospital, or stay in the hospital and unfortunately, potentially die. So there is this sense of urgency and I urge everyone to recognize that this is a high priority in the hospital system all across the state. And [INTERVIEWER6], let me just double down on the constructive inpatients. We are doing healthcare workers as the first traunch. First, we want those healthcare workers vaccinated for their safety and the safety of the public. If you are a nurse who was doing COVID testing, nasal swabs, if you are infected, you could come in contact with [CARDINAL] of people in [DATE]. They have the greatest probability of being a super spreader. So yes, constructive impatience to protect the healthcare worker and to protect the public who the healthcare worker is dealing with. That is why healthcare workers are the first priority. And constructive impatience because we want to get through the healthcare workers so we can get to the next traunch, which are the police and the bus drivers and the train operators and people with comorbidities and older people who are most vulnerable. We have to get down that list to get to people who are very vulnerable [DATE]. So yes, constructive impatience. Thank you very much.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingscottmcclellan63", "text": "And with that, I will be glad to go to your questions. Does the President know about, and approve of, this probe that is being announced by the [ORG] and [ORG] of the leak of the story about the [ORG] secret prisons -- I just saw the announcement on that. That was a decision made by the Speaker and the Majority Leader. I want to know what the President thinks about it. Well, we just found out about it not long ago. Well, does he think that is a good idea? Well, I think that you have heard him express his views. The leaking of classified information is a serious matter and ought to be taken seriously. But this is a congressional prerogative, and it was a decision that was made by those leaders, and that is the way I would describe it. I just wondered whether [ORG] basically endorses this under the circumstances. It was their decision, [INTERVIEWER1], is the way I would describe it. You might want to ask them questions about their decisions. There were the briefings that began, the ethics briefings that began [DATE]. Can you describe in some fashion what the presentation is that [ORG] staffers are hearing for [TIME], and what you are trying to accomplish? Sure. First let me step back and just talk about these so everybody in the room is familiar with what we are doing. The President takes the issue of the handling of classified information very seriously. And [DATE], or [DATE], at [FAC], he visited with his Chief of Staff, [PERSON], and his Counsel, [PERSON], about some steps that we should take here at [FAC]. And the President directed that action be taken to provide refresher briefings for all [ORG] staff -- that includes staff within [ORG], as well as staff within [ORG] of the President; that would include agencies that operate within [ORG], such as [ORG] and [ORG] and a number of others. The [ORG] staff knows very well what is expected of them. They are expected to focus on the people's business and they are expected to adhere to the highest ethical standards. The President has made that clear for quite some time. And he directed [PERSON] and [PERSON] to do these refresher briefings for all [ORG] staff. And they focus on general ethics rules, including rules governing the handling of classified information. So [DATE] there will be [TIME]-long sessions that will be conducted for all [ORG] staff that has security clearances of any level, whether that -- well, all staff that has any sort of security clearance. And so there will be -- in these briefings, which started [TIME], they are organized in an alphabetical way -- there will be a general overview of ethics issues, such as the standards of ethical conduct that are expected. There will be a discussion about classified information and the proper handling of classified national security information, how that material is classified, by whom, for how long, who has access to it, how the material is declassified, the badges that people wear to show their security clearances and so forth. The briefings discuss the security precautions that are in place for handling classified information such as the use of safes, or the use of specific locations to view classified information like [FAC] here at [ORG]. It will talk about the proper disposal of classified information. It will talk about the handling of classified information when you are transporting that classified information. And the briefings will include the rules and laws relating to classified information and what is expected of people. So that is kind of a general overview of these briefings. Is there underlying concern that the highest ethical standards have not been observed by everyone? Well, this was -- the President made this decision in light of recent circumstances, that we should take this action. And that is why he directed [ORG] to proceed with these refresher briefings. Every [ORG] staffer has to go through ethics briefings when they come on to the staff. You also have to go through detailed briefings when you are provided security clearances -- before you are provided those security clearances you go through very detailed briefings. And [DATE] there will be briefings conducted for remaining employees that do not have security clearances. So we thought that -- the President thought that this was an appropriate time to move ahead with these refresher briefings, and that is why he directed this course of action be taken. This is [DATE]. Where are the briefings held? And how many, like, typically in a class? They are held over in [FAC], or [FAC]. There is an auditorium over there. Is this all we should expect from the President, the ethics refresher courses, the extent of his reaction to the indictment? Well, as you are aware, if you are asking a question about an ongoing investigation, we are not going to have further say at this point while it continues. It is a very serious matter, and we are going to continue to cooperate. That is what the President directed us to do and that is what we are doing. I asked you a different question. Is this the full extent of what the President deems necessary, in light of circumstances? The President is always free to take the action that he feels is appropriate. Does the President think that [PERSON] lived up to the highest ethical standards -- Again, that is a question relating to an ongoing investigation. The President was asked about it [DATE]; he reiterated what we have previously said. This is a serious matter, it continues, and what we are going to do is continue to cooperate with that investigation. And that is why I made the point, too, that all of us here at [ORG] understand what the expectations are. We understand that we are expected to adhere to the highest standards. We understand that we are expected to focus on the work of the [NORP] people, and that is what we do. Do you think that while [PERSON] is under investigation that he should retain his security clearance? I am just not going to talk about an ongoing investigation. You are asking that question in the light of an ongoing investigation; it is something that continues at this point. [CARDINAL] last one on this. It just -- it strikes me as odd that, given the fact that [PERSON] has not been charged with any crime, he is merely under investigation, so far as we know, that the President's language about him and his confidence in him has been so distant, that he simply refuses to comment on his standing within [ORG] because of a pending matter. No, I do not agree with that. I mean, [PERSON] is continuing to perform his duties as Deputy Chief of Staff and Senior Advisor. We appreciate all that he is doing. So the President stands by [PERSON] [PERCENT]? Well, I have made it clear to you that everybody who works here at [ORG] has the confidence of the President. That is not exactly a direct answer, though. Well, you are asking a question relating to an ongoing investigation and -- Does he stand by [PERSON] [PERCENT]? -- the investigation relating to him is something that is ongoing, and the President has addressed that. -- forward-leaning as that, to say the President stands behind [PERSON] [PERCENT]? I just made the President's views known. I'd like you to clear up, once and for all, the ambiguity about torture. Can we get a straight answer? The President says we do not do torture, but [PERSON] -- That is about as straight as it can be. Yes, but [PERSON] has gone to the [ORG] and asked for an exemption on -- No, he has not. Are you claiming he is asked for an exemption on torture? No, that is -- He did not ask for that? -- that is inaccurate. Are you denying everything that came from the [ORG], in terms of torture? No, you are mischaracterizing things. And I am not going to get into discussions we have -- Can you give me a straight answer for once? Let me give it to you, just like the President has. We do not torture. He does not condone torture and he would never -- I am asking about exemptions. Let me respond. And he would never authorize the use of torture. We have an obligation to do all that we can to protect the [NORP] people. We are engaged -- That is not the answer I am asking for -- It is an answer -- because the [NORP] people want to know that we are doing all within our power to prevent terrorist attacks from happening. There are people in this world who want to spread a hateful ideology that is based on killing innocent men, women and children. We saw what they can do on [DATE] -- He did not ask for an exemption -- -- and we are going to -- -- answer that [CARDINAL] question. I am asking, is the administration asking for an exemption? I am answering your question. The President has made it very clear that we are going to do -- You are not answering -- yes or no? No, you do not want the [NORP] people to hear what the facts are, [INTERVIEWER1], and I am going to tell them the facts. -- the [NORP] people [DATE]. I am asking you, yes or no, did we ask for an exemption? And let me respond. You have had your opportunity to ask the question. Now I am going to respond to it. If you could answer in a straight way. And I am going to answer it, just like the President -- I just did, and the President has answered it numerous times. -- yes or no -- Our most important responsibility is to protect the [NORP] people. We are engaged in a global war against [NORP] radicals who are intent on spreading a hateful ideology, and intent on killing innocent men, women and children. Did we ask for an exemption? We are going to do what is necessary to protect the [NORP] people. Is that the answer? We are also going to do so in a way that adheres to our laws and to our values. We have made that very clear. The President directed everybody within this government that we do not engage in torture. We will not torture. He made that very clear. Are you denying we asked for an exemption? [INTERVIEWER1], we will continue to work with the [ORG] on the issue that you brought up. The way you characterize it, that we are asking for exemption from torture, is just flat-out false, because there are laws that are on the books that prohibit the use of torture. And we adhere to those laws. We did ask for an exemption; is that right? I mean, be simple -- this is a very simple question. I just answered your question. The President answered it [DATE]. What are we asking for? Would you characterize what we are asking for? We are asking to do what is necessary to protect the [NORP] people in a way that is consistent with our laws and our treaty obligations. And that is what we -- Why does the [ORG] need an exemption from the military? [PERSON], let us talk about people that you are talking about who have been brought to justice and captured. You are talking about people like [PERSON]; people like [PERSON]. I am asking you -- No, this is facts about what you are talking about. Why does the [ORG] need an exemption from rules that would govern the conduct of our military in interrogation practices? There are already laws and rules that are on the books, and we follow those laws and rules. What we need to make sure is that we are able to carry out the war on terrorism as effectively as possible, not only -- What does that mean -- What I am telling you right now -- not only to protect [NORP] from an attack, but to prevent an attack from happening in the first place. And, you bet, when we capture terrorist leaders, we are going to seek to find out information that will protect -- that prevent attacks from happening in the first place. But we have an obligation to do so. Our military knows this; all people within [GPE] government know this. We have an obligation to do so in a way that is consistent with our laws and values. Now, the people that you are bringing up -- you are talking about in the context, and I think it is important for the [NORP] people to know, are people like [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON] -- these are -- these are dangerous killers. So they are all killers -- Did you ask for an exemption on torture? That is a simple question, yes or no. No. And we have not. That is what I told you at the beginning. You want to reserve the ability to use tougher tactics with those individuals who you mentioned. Well, obviously, you have a different view from the [NORP] people. I think the [NORP] people understand the importance of doing everything within our power and within our laws to protect the [NORP] people. [INTERVIEWED1], are you saying that [PERSON] did not ask -- What is it that you want the -- what is it that you want the [ORG] to be able to do that [ORG] are not allowed to do? I am not going to get into talking about national security matters, [INTERVIEWER1]. I do not do that, because this involves -- This would be the exemption, in other words. This involves information that relates to doing all we can to protect the [NORP] people. And if you have a different view -- obviously, some of you on this room -- in this room have a different view, some of you on the front row have a different view. We simply are asking a question. What is the Vice President -- what is the Vice President asking for? It is spelled out in our statement of administration policy in terms of what our views are. That is very public information. In terms of our discussions with members of [ORG] -- -- no, it is not -- In terms of our members -- like I said, there are already laws on the books that we have to adhere to and abide by, and we do. And we believe that those laws and those obligations address these issues. So then why is the Vice President continuing to lobby on this issue? If you are very happy with the laws on the books, what needs change? Again, you asked me -- you want to ask questions of the Vice President's office, feel free to do that. We have made our position very clear, and it is spelled out on our website for everybody to see. We do not need a website, we need you from the podium. And what I just told you is what our view is. But [INTERVIEWED1], do you see the contradiction -- [PERSON], go ahead. Will the President pledge not to pardon [PERSON]? I am not going to discuss an ongoing legal proceeding, and I am not going to -- Can you just -- No, I am not going to speculate about any matters relating to it. This is something that is just beginning. There will be a hearing process that is going on right now, and we need to let that legal proceeding continue. I was asked this question [DATE], and that is -- I am just not going to speculate about things at this point. So if he is interested in seeing the legal process continue, that means he will not pardon him, is that correct? There is a legal proceeding -- That would interrupt the legal proceeding. -- that is going on relating to that individual. Under our system, there is a presumption of innocence. And we are not going to comment on it while it is continuing. And I am not going to -- certainly not going to speculate about it, as well. Should we take that to mean it remains a possibility? It should mean exactly what I said. Go ahead, [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWED1], before my question, I would like to thank the President and Mr. [PERSON] for -- at [FAC] -- --. My question is that we do not know when the immigration law pending in the [ORG] will be through, but at this time, trafficking problem is a big one, especially the -- Trafficking in persons? Yes. That is a high priority for this President to stop the trafficking in persons. -- especially from South Asia, and now [ORG] is working a story on a woman from [GPE]. They bring them here, and then they will not give them a green card and citizenship and work. And then they exploit them and rape them and use them. And then these women have nowhere to go, and they seek help from -- what they should do because there is no one to help them out. And then [ORG] have them deported -- they said you have no legal citizen here. What the President is going to do -- Well, the President has made preventing the trafficking in persons a high priority, particularly trafficking that is involving sex crimes. That is something that he has talked about at [ORG]. It is an issue -- the trafficking in persons is an issue that he talked about just the other day when we were in [GPE], and the President was participating in a roundtable with some young professionals. And one of those persons was someone who worked for an organization that was committed to doing what they can to stop the trafficking in persons. It is not only the sex trafficking, it is also the trafficking in persons that are seeking to come to our country illegally, simply to provide a better way of life for their families back home, their children, because they know that they might be able to provide a better opportunity for their families back home by coming here to [GPE]. And you have these coyotes, as the President has talked about, who illegally smuggle people into this country. That is something that we are focused on when it comes to enforcing our borders. That is why [CARDINAL] of the President's top priorities on his agenda is taking steps to strengthen our border enforcement and to move forward on comprehensive immigration reform, because people have lost their lives needlessly and we have got to do more to enforce our borders, as well as to move forward on other initiatives to improve our immigration system. We need a more practical and realistic immigration system to address these problems. At that meeting at [FAC], the President, [PERSON] and [PERSON] talked about steps that would be taken -- does that mean there is going to be something in addition to the ethics -- No, he was -- thank you for the opportunity to talk further about that. What the President directed them to do at [FAC] was to move forward on the action that is taking place [DATE] and [DATE], as well. But, I mean, the steps being taken -- so that is it, just the classes? If you are asking me to limit the President's ability to make decisions that he deems are appropriate, I am not going to do that. But this is the action that directed to be taken [DATE] at [FAC]. [INTERVIEWED1], is anyone in [ORG] exempt from participating in these and -- No, it is a mandatory session. Would the Vice President have to attend? It is mandatory for all [ORG] staff. That is who it is for. And he is considered staff? No, he is considered the Vice President. So he does not have to attend? All [ORG] staff is required to participate in these sessions. [INTERVIEWED1], if that is a refresher course, the initial time that they took this class, was there any kind of statement that people had to sign saying they understood what they had been trained or taught -- Well, when you go through the clearance process to receive classified clearances, or security clearances, you have to sign information and you go through detailed briefings. And is there a portion in this training that says there are consequences if you do not follow the rules, if you do not follow these procedures -- As I indicated at the beginning, everybody at [ORG] understands what is expected of them. And they acknowledge that in a statement? Is that true? No, I am not going to get into talking about everything that has to be signed when you go through a classified briefing on security clearances. But you do have to sign forms when you attend those briefings. Saying that you understand the rules and the regulations, and that type of thing, and the training -- that you have taken this training and you understand the consequences? Well, this is relating to classified security clearances, and that is all I will say on it, and it is what I just said. [INTERVIEWED1], [CARDINAL] on [GPE] and [GPE]. First of all, on the [NORP] arrests, has the [GPE] coordinated with them, and is this as a result of [GPE]'s cooperation with [GPE]? That is something that you ought to direct to [NORP] authorities. They have talked about it and you can check with our law enforcement authorities to see if there is any additional information. I will be glad to check on that, as well. Are you pleased with [GPE]'s actions? Do you have any comment? Well, they are a good partner in the global war on terrorism, and they have been pursuing individuals who seek to do harm to their citizens. And they have announced some of the steps that they have taken and some of the results of those steps. I do not have any additional information on it at this point, other than what they have said publicly, [PERSON]. On the [NORP] riots, do you have any message for the [NORP], and for Europe, in general, in light of these riots? And should [NORP] be encouraged to go to [GPE] and other countries which might -- Well, [NORP] should always look to the guidance put out by [ORG] in terms of travel, wherever they are traveling. It provides information regarding any security precautions or warnings that they should heed. And beyond that, you ought to talk to [GPE] about the steps they are taking to address that. Go ahead, [DATE]. [INTERVIEWED1], the President was asked about an apology to the [PERSON] family, and he did not answer it. And if -- I am wondering if that non-answer goes to the fact that an apology would be under review right now from the administration. It goes to the fact that there is an ongoing investigation and legal proceeding, and we are not going to have any further discussion of it while it is ongoing. So are you saying an apology would compromise the investigation? I do not know how I could make it more clear, in terms of our response to questions relating to an ongoing investigation. You said that Chief of Staff and the [ORG] Counsel were involved in planning the ethics classes. [PERSON] is a pretty hands-on guy; how involved was he in the planning -- It was the Counsel's Office. The Counsel's Office is the one that is responsible for conducting these ethics briefings. [PERSON] is our ethics counsel, and he is the one that conducts these briefings. So he was not involved at all in setting it up, as [PERSON] was? No, this was the President talking with [PERSON] and [PERSON] at [FAC], not [DATE], but [DATE]. So then you talk about having them in light of circumstances, is that a tacit acknowledgment that classified information has, in fact, been leaked? It was the way I described it. Okay, [CARDINAL] other quick one on the Vice President's lobbying. You said that we can direct questions to [ORG] and, presumably, the Vice President is operating with the full knowledge of the President, in terms of lobbying to get an exemption for the [ORG]. Are you saying that the Vice President's Office is operating independently? What [INTERVIEWER1] was asking earlier was the exemption for torture, and that is just a flat-out false characterization. And no one is asking for that because the President has already made -- -- the question was -- -- the President has already made it clear that we do not torture and we do not tolerate torture. In fact, if you look at -- let us go back and just step back from this and let us look at some of what has happened that has put a stain on the image of [GPE] abroad. And that was what happened at [FAC]. Well, what our military has done is acted to hold people accountable for their conduct, and to take steps to prevent something like that from happening again. They went through [CARDINAL] major investigations or reviews and looked at these issues. And now they have been implementing steps to prevent something like that from ever happening again. Now, I welcome an opportunity to talk about this -- uninterrupted, I might add -- to talk about the importance of what we are working to do in the global war on terrorism. And the [NORP] people I think ought to hear what we are working to do, because the President takes very seriously his responsibility to do all that he can to protect them. We saw what happened on -- -- -- Hang on, I am coming to your question. We saw what happened on [DATE], when [CARDINAL] 000 innocent men, women and children were killed in [GPE], in [GPE] and in the fields of [GPE]. The President made a decision on [DATE] that we were going to go on the offensive, that we were going to use all available tools to bring to justice those who seek to do us harm before they could carry out their attacks. And he also made a commitment to work to change the status quo in the Middle East by spreading freedom. For too long we thought we had stability and peace in the Middle East, and we got neither. It became a breeding ground for terrorism. And that is why it is so important what we are working to achieve in the broader Middle East. That is why it is so important that we succeed in [GPE], because [GPE] will be an example to the rest of the Middle East, just like [GPE] is, in terms of that. And in terms of what [ORG] is considering -- or, at least the [ORG], in terms of this amendment -- the President answered this question just [DATE]. He talked about how we would continue to work with members of [ORG] to address this issue. But there are already -- What is [ORG] -- -- there are already laws on the books, but not only laws, they are also values that we very much adhere to. But we have an obligation to the [NORP] people -- How do values blend with what you said earlier, which is what is necessary ? If what is necessary needs to be done, does that -- does what is necessary necessarily fit in with our values? What is necessary within our laws and within our values. So that means not torture -- You bet, the President is going to act to do what he can to prevent an attack from happening on the [NORP] people. That is what the [NORP] people expect. But we are going to do so consistent with our laws and values, and we have made that repeatedly clear. So what is the Vice President lobbying for? And is he doing it on behalf of [ORG], or is he operating independently? Again, I just said we are going to continue to work with [ORG]. Go ahead. Why do not you answer the [CARDINAL] question on exemption? I just did, [INTERVIEWER1]. Does [ORG] have -- I mean, you blanket -- covered [ORG]. [ORG] is under [ORG]. Why cannot you just -- why cannot you answer? I am not going to get into all the discussions we have with members of [ORG]. If they want to add additional information, you are welcome to contact their office, as well. Well, they do not answer like you do. You are at that podium. We need to hear from you. You -- And I just made it clear -- -- are the Press Secretary for all -- There is a statement of administration policy that has been put out. And -- but let us talk about what this issue is relating to. This issue is relating to the protection of the [NORP] people and making sure that the President of [GPE] has the tools he needs to be able to prevent attacks from happening, and to be able to stop those terrorists who still seek to do us harm from carrying out their attacks in the first place. -- the Vice President wants torture? Which -- Wrong. That is absolutely false. Well, then tell us -- The President has made it very clear that we do not torture. What is the Vice President doing? I just told you. You have not. I am not trying to be -- I am not going to let you -- you are mischaracterizing what this is about. [INTERVIEWED1], no, we want to know -- It is clearly in the statement of administration policy. [DATE], look, you can keep showboating for the cameras, but we have made clear what our views are. Thank you -- I showboat well, thank you -- Well, you are. Let us be honest about it. I am being honest. I want an honest answer from you. And you got it in the statement of administration policy. -- in the website. That is not -- that is not -- You got it in the statement of administration policy. There are already laws on the books that cover these issues. -- this issue -- Yes, and that is what it is. Well, give it to us then. Go look on our website. I will be glad to provide it to you. -- which website? And I just told you what it is. Are you not listening? I just told you what it is. [INTERVIEWED1], [ORG] is revising -- I think you need to calm down a little bit and let me respond. Go ahead. [INTERVIEWED1], [ORG] is revising its policy guidelines for the treatment of detainees for the war on terror -- Yes. Vice President [PERSON]'s office, his senior staff, had advised the uniform military lawyers working on this document that [ORG] is opposed to including any reference to Geneva Convention terms for humane treatment of detainees. Vice President [PERSON]'s spokeswoman told us [DATE] that that -- that the Vice President is pursuing the President's policy in holding that -- I do not think -- who told you the first part of this? Let us talk about where that came from, first of all. Well, the -- what are you talking about? The Vice President's office I do not think told you that first part of that, and you made it sound like the first part of that was from the Vice President's office. I do not think they told you that. No, I am not trying to make it sound like they did. There is -- Well, you are declaring that as fact. -- published reports in [ORG] and [ORG] -- we are reporting, as well. So the question is, what is the President's view with respect to this [ORG] policy guideline on the treatment of -- We have great confidence in Secretary [PERSON] and [ORG] to move forward on steps to prevent something like what happened at [FAC] from happening again. And that is what this comes out of, because, as I pointed out earlier, [ORG] undertook [CARDINAL] major investigations and reviews -- and/or reviews. They also pursued a number of cases against individuals who were responsible for these abuses, and they pursued people and held them to account. That is what [GPE] does. And that is the way we show the world what we are all about. We are about values and laws, and about adhering to those values and laws. And that is what we will continue to do. So they have taken steps, and are continuing to take steps, to put in place some policy directives that will build upon what they already had in place. Is the President opposed to any reference to Geneva Convention or adherence to the Geneva Convention, directly, in this [ORG] policy guideline? Well, in terms of the guidelines, those are guidelines that [ORG] will issue. And so I'd encourage you to talk further with them about that. Anytime there is something like this, there is an interagency process that goes on, and a number of people are involved in providing input into that process. That is part of the interagency process; that is a healthy part of being able to come to these decisions. And so that is what you are talking about. The President has no view? We support the action that [ORG] has taken, and have great confidence in the steps that they are taking to address these matters. In terms of views that we express, we do that through the interagency process. [INTERVIEWED1], [CARDINAL]-part. [ORG], [ORG], and [ORG] all reported [DATE] that the [ORG] has threatened to revoke the tax-exempt status of [ORG] in [GPE], [GPE], because its retired rector, [PERSON], implied to parishioners before the [DATE] election that [PERSON] would not have voted for [PERSON]. And my question: Is it possible that the President supports any such attempt to muzzle the pulpit? I do not think the President gets involved in decisions that are made by churches. And my second. Since President [PERSON] supports the creation of a separate [NORP] state to halt [NORP] violence in [GPE], will he now back the creation of an autonomous [GPE]-stinian state to quell violence in [GPE]? The President has made very clear what his view is when it comes to the Middle East peace process. And he was the first President to articulate a policy of [CARDINAL] states living side-by-side in peace and security. We are making great progress there. In terms of what is going on in [GPE], you need to talk to the [NORP] government on how they are working to address those matters. That is a matter -- internal matter to [GPE]. Senator [PERSON] has come up with the idea that even though the administration is opposed to windfall profit tax, that major oil corporations voluntarily hand over [PERCENT] of their vast oil profits to help pay for -- to help direct this money toward low-income housing, or home fuel heating expenses. Does [ORG] have any objection to this, if it is done voluntarily, for helping those -- -- there are some congressional leaders who have talked about the importance of investing in our energy infrastructure. That is a goal that the President shares. We all have a responsibility to do our part. That means the federal government, it means businesses, and it means consumers. We need to do more to invest in our energy infrastructure and address the root causes of high energy prices. Now, energy prices have come down some in [DATE], but there is action that we need to continue to take. That is why we acted with [ORG] to pass a comprehensive national energy strategy. That is why we are working with [ORG] to look at ways we might be able to expand refining capacity. And the private sector has a role to play in all this, too. And all of us need to do our part. That is the message the President would say. Would that include the private sector having some responsibility in helping to alleviate the cost of home heating? What you are talking about -- in terms of the goal that members of [ORG] are talking about, which is that we need to do more to invest in our energy infrastructure, that is a goal we share. And we are going to continue to work with them, and we are going to continue to urge all people, in the private sector and in government, to do their part to help address this issue. And Secretary [PERSON] spoke some about this [DATE]. Go ahead. I am going to keep going. Go ahead. With respect to the ethics classes that are being conducted, do they address the grounds for dismissal? And the reason I ask that is because, as you know, the President changed the ground rules on the grounds of dismissal by saying initially that those involved will be dismissed, and then later saying, only those that are convicted will be dismissed. Does that mean that -- Everybody at [ORG] serves at the pleasure of the President. And I have made that very clear to you. So I would not agree with your characterization. Go ahead. Do you ever say to yourself, I have had enough of this, [GPE] is really nice [DATE]? I am glad to help the President implement his optimistic agenda for the [NORP] people. And I enjoy working with the people in this room most of the time. And I look forward to continuing to -- How about [DATE]? -- look forward to continuing to do it. Sure, I enjoy it because -- an important topic was raised at the beginning of this briefing, and I am glad to talk about it. Some were intent on trying to jump in and not let me respond fully. And I understand that. They are just trying to do their job. But there are important -- there are important points that need to be made to the [NORP] people. There is a reminder that we will continue to make to the [NORP] people. We remain a country that is engaged in a global war on terrorism. And it is important that we do everything within our power to go after those who seek to do us harm and to prevent attacks from happening in the first place. And this President will do that. But he will do so in a way that is consistent with our laws and our values. And that is an important point to remember. But when we are talking about this issue, let us have an open discussion about it, and let us talk about the type of people that we are talking about who have been brought to justice, people like [PERSON], people like [PERSON]. These are people that were operational planners involved in carrying out attacks that led to the death of [CARDINAL] 000 [NORP]. And the President is determined to prevent something like that from ever happening again. And he is going to do his part to make sure he fulfills the obligation he has to the [NORP] people, which is to do everything he can to protect them. So I welcome the discussion. Go ahead. [INTERVIEWED1], who would be the highest ranking staffer whose attendance is required at these briefings? Assistants to the President. Would the Chief of Staff -- Yes. -- go? He is an assistant to the President. Yes. He participated in the meeting [TIME], absolutely. In fact, I think a number of assistants to the President participated in the first meeting, even though it was for A through B. And I think C through D was later, and E and F later, and then more over [DATE]. So they cut [CARDINAL]? But all the assistants to the President were ones -- Would you make [PERSON] available to us? I am sorry? Would you make [PERSON] available to us? Well, he is conducting these briefings for staff. This is relating to classified information, so you can understand the nature of the briefings, and I do not think you have security clearance. But he could tell us what the guidelines are for what people are -- He is not talking about classified information in the briefing. Well, we will be glad to provide you public information that is on general information guidelines. But information related to classified security briefings, some of that information, by nature, is involved just for people with security clearances. And I am not aware that you have one at this point. He is not talking about classified information in the briefing. He is talking about the guidelines. He is talking about guidelines. No, it involves talking about classified matters -- [INTERVIEWER1], you are wrong. Go ahead. You may have noticed that [ORG], [ORG] -- I am sorry, could you speak up just a little bit? You may have noticed that [ORG], [ORG] have had reports about a human rights lawyer in [GPE] whose office was forced to close down because he wrote an open letter to the [NORP] leader asking them to stop the persecution of [ORG] spiritual movement in [GPE]. Since President [PERSON] is going to Asia [DATE], do you think this is some issue he will address? Well, the President had some interviews [TIME]. I would encourage you to look at those interviews because one of the topics he talked about was human rights. That is something we talk about publicly and privately as a high priority for this President. We have always made the promotion of human rights and human dignity at the top -- always put it at the top of our agenda. And that is what we will continue to do. And, yes, the President will continue to talk openly and candidly with leaders he meets with, including when he goes to [GPE], about the importance of freedom of religion for instance. [DATE] the President and Mrs. [PERSON] look forward to welcoming His Holiness the Dalai Lama to [FAC]. He is met with him on a number of occasions before, and they will talk about issues relating to [GPE]. And you bet when the President goes to Asia [DATE], he will continue to talk about the importance of promoting human rights and human dignity for all. We have an obligation -- all of us in the world have an obligation to speak out about human rights. And where those human rights are being undermined, we have a right to speak out about them in places that the -- in countries that the President has talked about before. [CARDINAL] question he got [TIME] was relating to [GPE] and the treatment of people in [GPE]. And he talked about that at length. Go ahead. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED1]. There are negotiations underway [DATE] to further liberalize the Open Skies agreement between [GPE] and [GPE], essentially the fifth freedom which would allow, in this case, [NORP] airlines to compete for the lucrative domestic international market. Considering the state of the [NORP] airlines, [CARDINAL] now seeking bankruptcy protection, does the President believe that this is the right time to open up this market to -- That is something we continue to discuss with [GPE]. I do not have the latest update on any of those discussions. We have been in South America for [DATE] focused on some other matters. But I am sure that if you direct those questions to the appropriate agency, they can provide you an update, in terms of that. Understood. But in general terms, considering the state of the [NORP] airline industry right now, does the President believe that it is a good time to start changing -- Well, the [NORP] airline industry is going through a transition. They have been going through that transition for some time because of the changing economy that we live in, and the changing nature of their business. All right, thank you.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "pelosihousegovnewspressreleasestranscriptofpelosiweeklypressconferencetoday6", "text": "[INTERVIEWED1], [PERSON], a lawyer in [ORG] who gave President [PERSON] some powers through a legal memo that [ORG] interpreted back then to combat terrorism and the role of Commander-In-Chief without necessary congressional approval, said: [PERSON] has adopted the same view of war powers as [ORG]. Do you share that view? No, I do believe that when we passed the authorization in [DATE] following [GPE], it was to narrow the war powers then. When our country is - when someone strikes our country as was on 9/11, it enables, it triggers any and all powers of the Commander-In-Chief. What we did with that resolution was to narrow it to the purposes. I have it right here, but if you read it, you will see that it is a narrower interpretation. What [ORG], how they interpreted it and for how long is another issue. But he is not relevant to right now. What we are talking about right now is: [ORG] is a threat. We have to work together to destroy them, and that is the subject at hand. I did not approve of anything [[PERSON]] said or did when he was in office, much less care about his opinion right now. But you do not think that President [PERSON] is following his opinion right now? I mean I think the President is following the law. Yes, ma'am. Given the threat the President outlined that [ORG] posed and you mentioning it, does not [ORG] have a bigger role beyond just voting on the narrow authorization for Title X? Is not it shirking its responsibility by just focussing on that issue alone? Well, Title X is really an important part of this and among the initiatives that the President talked about [TIME], the idea of our training [NORP] moderates to fight [ORG] in [GPE] is an important part of it and it is very timely. That is why we are talking about that now. I would hope that it would be in the CR because that is the train leaving the station, and that is- the President needs this to happen now. There is talk of people doing it separately, but that takes longer than just putting it on, again, the [FAC] that is leaving the station. But that is by no means to say that that is the limitation on our involvement in this. In factthere is a presidential request for [MONEY] for meeting needs in Eastern Europe related to [GPE], [GPE], and other concerns in the Middle East. But in terms of this authorization, this is a big debate. We are having a brief right now. As I leave here, I will go to another briefing on the subject. And again, yes, I do believe [ORG] has a role. What I did say, though, was what the President is doing now, I think he has the legal authority to do. I know he does. I have studied this issue for a very long time. Yes, sir? You have been in the Intelligence here for a very, very long time. How far do your concerns go as we take new steps to confront [ORG] about the aftermath - the potential aftermath of the [NORP] arming their [NORP] assets in [GPE]? The [NORP] arming the [NORP] militias anew? Us arming the factions in [GPE], all that come at [ORG] sort of in a triangle here? And eventually, there will be a lot more armed people in [GPE], not only weapons but battle hardened people with - have their incentives changed at all? What is your vision of the aftermath after we do this? Well, I started my comments in praise of the President about the establishment of a different government in [GPE], which I think, if that had not happened - so then the situation that you are describing, I believe, would be exacerbated - although your concerns go beyond [GPE], I understand. It goes into [GPE]. So, to have a government that understands its responsibilities - that it is not just about who the [NORP] in charge, the [NORP] rule and we do not pay any attention to the needs of [NORP] or the [NORP] - that provides fertile territory for some, especially the [NORP], to be responsive to [ORG] when they were originally coming through. When you are arming people, you are always concerned. And also, [ORG], I am concerned, is a mutating thing, you know, what is it that it becomes and what emerges out of all of this. So that is why it has to be comprehensive. The [NORP] are very interested because they have [CARDINAL]. We may have [CARDINAL] foreign fighters from the [GPE] who have gone there. The [NORP] have [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL] maybe, who have passports from their countries, who are citizens of their countries who have joined the fighting force. So the concern goes beyond our concern about our homeland; that is our primary responsibility. But this is a very big deal and we have to deal with it in a way that is not just- and [PERSON] talked about it- the use of violence. Yet people think [CARDINAL] more act of violence is going to end it, but it is just an endless flywheel. No, we have to be smart about it as to how we go forward so that we are having not just military initiatives but political initiatives and diplomatic initiatives, too, so that we reduce the fertile territory for more recruitment of terrorists. Then what level of confidence has been transmitted to you, [INTERVIEWED1], from the [ORG] that [NORP] coalition [CARDINAL] or whatever we are on now is actually going to work this time? Well, we have to support it. And [CARDINAL] other part that I did not mention was continuing the humanitarian assistance in some of those regions. As you see what the [GPE] did to help those people on the mountain was lifesaving, but it was also helpful in having people understand that we are there to help the people. We are not there to help the government. But to have a government that is there for all of the people is essential for us to be putting in resources because your question is exactly the right one. This, the government has to work or otherwise the investments that we are making otherwise - diplomatically, politically, intelligence wise, militarily - fall into a chaotic situation; so we cannot have that. It is challenging and it is complicated. That is why I think the President's deliberativeness in how he has dealt with this step by step to put us in a place now where we can go to the next step, because the first, initial - not everything has been done as far as the government is concerned, but a great deal has been done. Yes, sir? On the Continuing Resolution, [CARDINAL] questions. [CARDINAL]: how do you feel about setting the end date for the reauthorization date to [ORG] separate from the [DATE] end date for the CR? And then the [ORG]: there is some talk of trying to set that end date for the CR actually in [DATE]. How do you feel about those and how do those affect the [NORP] support for a CR here? Well, CRs are never something to be very, very proud of because it means that we have not been able to get all of our work done in a timely fashion. Sometimes they are a convenience and sometimes they are an excuse not to - well, let us just do a CR, and I say that as one who has had to use CRs myself. But the CR end date for [DATE] is very appropriate. That is what the CR does: to get us past the [DATE] beginning of a new fiscal year. So the end date in [DATE] is an appropriate one so that we will pass something, an omnibus, a better deal, a more responsible way to advance our appropriations for [DATE]. I do not think we should delay it any longer. What are the choices? I mean, we know what the decisions are that need to be made. If they do not think that they can be made within [DATE], then they should be made within [DATE]. In terms of the expiration date for [ORG], I am totally opposed to that. I think that [ORG] is a formidable instrument for competitiveness for the [GPE] businesses, large and small. I think that it affects every region of the country in terms of job creation and stability. I think that it has already having an impact on contracts because of there is uncertainty about the longevity of the bank and even its existence and that if you put the date to [DATE], you are effectively putting a marker as to the demise of [ORG]. So, let us just go forward. I like the [PERSON] bill that has a long term authorization for [ORG], and I would hope that those forces outside the [ORG] - communities that are affected, businesses that are affected and the rest - that this is about job creation; this is about keeping [GPE] number [CARDINAL]; it is about facilitating our exports. To play with this is really damaging, because you are dealing with a bank and you are talking about [DATE] and [DATE] and [DATE], you are not talking about the stability and the certainty that businesses need. And some of these are very big contracts. So again, as far as the forces outside the [ORG], I do not know why they are not more active with their [NORP] friends to say: this is not something to mess with, because I do not believe that it is good. Yes, sir? [INTERVIEWED1], there never really has been much hope for peace dividend following the, you know, 9/11 mindset and foreign policy, et cetera, as we wound down the wars in [GPE] and [GPE]. Do some of your [ORG] members, though, worry that as this fight against [ORG] gets expanded, we will siphon off a lot of dollars for social programs? Yes. That they may favor? Yes. Well, there is some necessities that honor our responsibilities to meet the needs of the [NORP] people. I do not think we are getting - I do not think with the evidence that I see before me, I judge, that what we are talking about is by no means of the scale of where we had been before. This is focused, targeted, discreet, and it is not engaging in [CARDINAL] of troops being deployed. In fact, it is exactly the opposite of that. But certainly, every time we talk about an initiative or the use of force or initiation of hostilities, it is a question of resources, and we have so many unmet needs in our own country. It is really, what is more of concern to Members when we were building roads and schools and hospitals and all the rest in [GPE] and [GPE], when we had unmet needs in our own country, but actually that part of the diplomacy is important to security as well. But in answer to your question: yes, there is a concern, and it has been brought up at our meetings, but we have a first responsibility to protect and defend. That is the oath we uphold. I think I only have time for [CARDINAL] more question. Yes, ma'am? [INTERVIEWED1], has there been a concern raised in [ORG] in voting for this authorization and ending up in a situation potentially in the future where you have sort of a political pushback much like you did with the authorization for [GPE]? Well, we did not vote for the authorization for [GPE], so we did not get to take - well, and [ORG] [NORP] overwhelmingly voted against the [GPE] initiative in [DATE]. [DATE] initiation was in [DATE], of hostilities. But right now we are watching, observing, and judging. The President made- we have briefed. The President made his speech [TIME] which was very strong and convincing. Our Members are proud and support the President. We are being briefed right now, once again. And so the question is: what is the challenge? What are our resources? How do we engage other countries? What is the country that we are dealing with in terms of having a new government? And what is, you know, what is our definition of success? But it is not about, you know, whether we take a vote or not. We are not at that point because we believe the President has the authority. And so it is deliberative; it is open to new information - that is what our [ORG] is about - and I am very proud of the thoughtful way that they have approached it. I will go back to where I began on this subject, and that is, that a matter of [DATE] we did vote and we got an amendment on the floor. And I think I have it right here and what it says: The President shall not deploy or maintain [GPE] armed forces in a sustained combat role in [GPE] without specific statutory authorization for such use, and that is after the date of the enactment of this concurrent resolution. So, hopefully we do not have to go beyond what the President is doing now and we will not need that vote, but we stand ready to have that discussion. Thank you all very much. I have to go back to work.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "pelosihousegovnewspressreleasestranscriptofpelosipressconferencetoday131", "text": "Did you get the impression during this discussion in [FAC] that the President seemed to be more inclined to negotiate with you and Leader [PERSON] than he did with [PERSON] and [PERSON]? No. I think the President when we went into the meeting, there are [CARDINAL] of us and [CARDINAL] of them, the President, the Vice President, [[ORG]] [NORP] Leader [[PERSON]], the Speaker [[PERSON]], the Majority Leader [[PERSON]] and Secretary of the [ORG] [[PERSON]] participated in those conversations. So, no, I think that they all came in, the Vice President said, 'you know, you put out your number before we had this meeting.' We put out our number after you put out your number, because they had put out the number earlier. No, I think, frankly, as I said, and maybe I will make it clear, when it was clear that we could not go for a longer CR from their standpoint because the [ORG] needs the resources in a fuller way - a CR, they do not even like a CR, period. They would rather we just pass the bills right now. And hopefully, we will do it soon. But we have issues. You know, we want parity. If you are going to lift caps on [ORG], then you are going to lift caps on discretionary domestic investments as well. So it was kind of - it became persuasive when [PERSON] - the Majority Leader in the [ORG] [[PERSON]] said 'I want to do - I am going to put the CR, ' and that is really what actually strengthened our hand for [DATE]. Were you surprised the President came around so quickly? No, it was not quick. I think maybe that is one of the reasons I decided to share so much with you [TIME], because I was reading on TV we went in there, we put it on the table, boom, out the door. No, it was not like that at all. It was a very long, intense conversation. Now, I am an appropriator, so I had a little bit of an advantage, in my view - as I said to the President, left to our own devices, the appropriators, [NORP] and [NORP], can work together to have a compromise on what we should do. It is when the poison pill comes from on high that there is a problem of legislating on an appropriations bill. So we had those kind of, shall we say, clarifications as we went along. But it was a long meeting. And I was very proud of [ORG] [NORP] Leader [PERSON]. He could speak [GPE] to the President. [INTERVIEWED1], the President sided with you [DATE] against his [NORP] colleagues. [TIME] you spoke on the phone. You asked him to tweet something. He did it. Are we seeing some kind of renaissance in your relationship, a new era of cooperation? Well, renaissance would indicate something went before and now it is a renaissance, reborn. Here is the thing. The President - I am hoping and I am praying, and I do not say that as a clich, I am praying that the President really cares about the DREAMers, or knows that he should care about the DREAMers, and that we are going to pass this bill. And we want to do it as soon as possible, to strike while the iron is hot because public opinion is so much in favor. And the churches, the faith-based community, the business community; people who care about [GPE] are all weighing in on this. But [CARDINAL] of the - maybe not [CARDINAL], but some of the concerns that people have when it came out is - 'you said [DATE], ' and these people are being fearful that 'pack up because you are out of here in [DATE], ' not 'we have [DATE] and we are going to pass a bill, so take comfort.' So that is what I said to him. He called [TIME]. I said thanks for calling, this is what we need. The people really need a reassurance from you, Mr. President, that the [DATE] period is not a period of roundup, but it is just the [ORG] is frozen and that these people will not be vulnerable. Is that why he called or did he want to discuss other issues? Well, you know, I am not famous for going into details of conversations with Presidents. We did talk about some other issues. But that was because he then put out this. And I was reporting to my colleagues, I said, 'this is what I asked [him] to do, ' and boom, boom, boom, the tweet appeared. But you know, again, this is when you are dealing on something that relates to immigration and the past experience, you have to build as much trust as possible because there is so much fear. And we are hoping that they will not be rounding up people, that their only violation of the law in some people's view is status. And this was not even a violation of law that they did, because they came as children. So it is about the children, it is about young people, and we have to pass a bill. And that might mean on whatever vehicle is leaving the station, or maybe we can just do the DREAM Act free and clear. We are collecting - what we are doing right now, we are asking others to do, is collecting co-sponsorships for Congresswoman [PERSON]'s bill, the DREAM Act. As you know, we passed it in the [NORP] [ORG] in [DATE]. It could not get [CARDINAL] votes in the [ORG]. But it did get a majority of votes in the [ORG]. So a majority of people in [ORG] at that time voted for it. We think we have a stronger hand now. I know we have a lot on the [DATE] docket here that we are talking about, but another issue that is been kind of in the weeds and we have not talked about much lately is an AUMF [Authorized Use of Military Force]. And lay out to the average person why this is such a nettlesome issue when you have both [NORP] and [NORP] support, this is not a partisan issue, and why this is so challenging? The authorization of the use of military force, as we call the AUMF, is something that [PERSON], our Congresswoman on [ORG] won, actually, in committee. It disappeared in [ORG]. I have seen a lot around here, but I have never seen anything disappear. I have seen people remove it or vote it down, but disappear is new. It is thought that the authorization for the use of force that was passed at the time of our initiation of hostilities into [GPE] was such that it is time for something new. The impression I have from the [ORG] is they think that what they are doing now is covered by the AUMF of [DATE], in [DATE]. As you know, the aspects of an AUMF are about timing. How long does it last? Geography. What does this cover? Scope. What does it allow you to do? Boots on the ground, whatever. So in terms of reviewing those aspects of for how long and for how wide an area and what the scope of the military involvement would be, it is always - I think it would be really important for us to revisit. Now, it was all predicated on [ORG], and then it was justified in terms of [ORG] being a continuation of [ORG]. And now geographically, it is in East Africa, you know, it is a broader area than what the original bill was about. So I would hope that we always would revisit something that is what, now [DATE], and in a whole different world. But they are saying that they have it. Now, when President [PERSON] was President and we wanted to have one, Speaker [PERSON] at the time said we want to see an AUMF proposal from [ORG]. [ORG] made - that is not really necessary. The AUMF is about our role in the use of force. But nonetheless, the President sent over his proposal. I think that they probably would want to give and then we never acted upon it. But I think that they would probably give President [PERSON] even more authority than was in the original. So I am not - I think we should revisit it. But I do not see that happening? How is this exacerbated now concerning the President's [DATE] message about recommitting to [GPE]? Doing what? He said - you know - there was a question about what he was doing about [GPE]. He recommitted, said we are going to put in more troops, he was not going to draw back, and the fact that changes the equation here a little bit and the concern of some with an AUMF. I think it begs the question that we should revisit the AUMF. [INTERVIEWED1] - just a quick change of subjects here. You called for the idea of the [NORP] statues in the [FAC], at least for the [GPE] that deal with these statues, to perhaps have them removed. This whole debate, I mean your father dedicated the [NORP] statues over in [GPE], I think, in [DATE] [PERSON], [PERSON]. These statues were vandalized. I think it was the [PERSON] statue over in [GPE]. What is the question? I am just wondering, is there any concern that now this has been expanded to perhaps maybe rewrite history a bit, maybe a revisionist history? What is the question? Okay? Do you have concerns that there has been - There is concern; you have seen Congresswoman [PERSON], I think, is introducing a measure [DATE]. Senator [[PERSON] said he is going to be introducing legislation. All I was suggesting was when I was Speaker - what I did was, I tried to, shall we say, mix it up in the [FAC]. We put [PERSON], we put [PERSON], more women, more minorities, and in significant places. My suggestion was just to the Speaker to review that. I do not know what will happen with any legislation. [INTERVIEWED1] - You have had your hand up for a while. I tried. Are you simply optimistic that President [PERSON] would sign the DREAM Act, or have you been given a direct indication from him that he would do that? The latter. Do you want to say it more proactively? I thought I spoke about that a lot. The President, both [DATE] in the meeting and [DATE], made it very clear he wants [ORG] to act to get this done. Now, just kind of in the back and forth of all of this, what was interesting to me is that the President well, the Attorney General's statement was something that was the equivalent of the worst statue you could ever think of. It was about white people in [GPE]. And it was a terrible, terrible statement. It was consistent with what the [PERSON] folks talk about when they want the purification of [GPE]. They sort of want to export - they want to deport the [CARDINAL] people in the country. So in that, shall we say, concern that we have, when the President said [DATE] and [ORG] should act, and if they do not I will revisit it, well, if you are saying that the action that President [PERSON] took was not legal, how are you going to revisit it? It is going to be legal for you but it was not legal for President [PERSON], and that is why you have to overturn it now? So I think we all came to a good place. [ORG] should act. We should remove all doubt. There should be statutory protection for the DREAMers. And quite the fact is that we need comprehensive immigration reform. And that would cover a lot more than just the DREAMers. But for right now, we have to strike while the iron is hot, the iron being what President [PERSON] talked about that I quote all the time, public sentiment is everything. And public sentiment is with the DREAMers. A clarification on that? So is this free and independent of any consideration of border enforcement? He said he would sign a standalone bill? I think he probably wants some border enforcement. And we have a responsibility to secure our borders. I have talked to him about, we specifically talked about drugs coming into the country, and the biggest protector of that for us, that has been [ORG]. They have been the biggest interdictor of drugs coming into our country. But it does not include a wall, no. [INTERVIEWED1]? Yes, ma'am. Following up on [PERSON]'s question, more broadly than DREAMers, is this a new day of cooperation you think you have with the President? [TIME] he tweeted that he is looking forward to working with [NORP] and [NORP]. Do you think that you are entering a new era of bipartisanship? I do not know that. What I do know is that the world we live in is a giant kaleidoscope. One day certain factors are in the design. Say this side of the room is opposed to what is happening on this side of the room. [DATE] it could be the front of the room versus the back of the room. You never know. So everybody you work with is a resource to you, or can be. So you want to have your debate and your engagement in a way that always recognizes that this person can be a resource in the next debate. A great woman who served here, [PERSON], she would say to me sometimes when I would get, shall we say, exuberant on the floor, 'darling, darling' she always said darling; she was from [GPE] '[PERSON] [[PERSON]], ' who was the Whip, '[PERSON] used to always say, do not fight every fight as if it is your last fight.' So let us hope that this is a sign of something to come. But you never know where your shared interests might be. The [CARDINAL] thing that is for sure, we will not in terms of what they are proposing on the tax cuts is severely detrimental to everything that we would care about in a budget in a bipartisan way. So we have some clear lines and others where we want to work together on reforming the tax code, simplifying it, make it more fair, making it more - supplying what we need to meet the needs of the [NORP] people. So we have some things that we know are bigger problems than others, but are always hopeful that we can find common ground, which we have a responsibility to do. If we cannot find it, we stand our ground. So, hopefully, always. Yes, sir. I have got to go. I have got a [DATE] job, you know? [NORP] frequently warn of the dangers of uncertainty in the economy, uncertainty if [ORG] does not act upon the government and there is a threat of a shutdown or does not raise the debt ceiling; there is a threat of a government default. [DATE], here the [NORP] are offering an [DATE] debt limit extension, which would have offered certainty for [DATE]. [NORP] step in and say, no, let us do it for [DATE]. And [TIME] you said you did it solely for the purpose of political leverage in [DATE]. No, no, I did not say that. I did not say that. I said they said that about us. They said 'you are just doing this for political leverage.' I am saying we need leverage to do what we need to do. But I do not - if your question is 'why do not we just - why do not we just do away with it?' Now that is something we can talk about. Why do not we just do away with [ORG] voting to lift the debt ceiling? The Constitution says that the full faith and credit of [GPE] shall not be questioned, is not in doubt. The [PERSON] rule that we lived under for a long time, named for a former Leader [PERSON], was that it was contained in the budget bill, and when the budget passed, the debt ceiling was lifted. The President even suggested, has anybody ever thought about eliminating this vote? And we said we will take it back to our caucus. We will take it back to our caucus. So I do not see that at all. No. I thought you said earlier that you had met with the caucus before going to [ORG], and that the consensus was that you cannot do anything longer term than the CR because then you lose leverage. And that was the argument that you took to [ORG]. No, all I said to them is this is what we are going to present. This is what we are going to present. But does a short term debt limit increase not increase the uncertainty in the economy? Now you have to vote on it twice in [DATE] versus twice in [DATE]. No. In fact, what creates uncertainty is what the [NORP] did [DATE], where they said they were not going to lift the debt ceiling, and that that took our credit rating from [ORG] to AA, just the suggestion. We said to them, most of our Members have signed a letter to lift the debt ceiling, and we will revisit that when we finish with the appropriations bills and the rest of it. So we have not , we have said we are not going to let the government default. We are not going to let the government default. They have not said that. They do not have the votes. That is why [DATE]. You see? He said that was the last question. Thank you all very much.", "discourse_type": 1}

And when he is looking down, I want to make sure [TIME] he sees his bridge lit up blue. And I think it'll put a smile on his face. Questions, comments? In terms of having concerns about people coming here from other states, are there anything, sort of protocols, you can put in place? Temperature checks at the airport, et cetera. I know it is much harder to do by people traveling by car, but is there anything the state can do to really make sure there is not- Yeah, we are not there yet, [INTERVIEWER1]. What other states did, if you remember in the beginning, when they were afraid of [NORP] going there, they did a mandatory quarantine. That if [NORP] traveled to their state, they had to quarantine for [DATE]. We are not there yet, but it is just a great point of irony that when we start this situation, the other states said, No, we do not want [NORP] coming here. Federal government was talking about blockading [GPE] and not allowing [NORP] to leave. Right? That is what they were talking about. Now, it would have been illegal, unconstitutional, and it would have started a civil war, but I do not know that any of those things is ever stopped the federal government before. But that is where we were. They wanted to blockade [GPE]. The other states wanted to make sure [NORP] went to their state. Fast forward [DATE]. We have the lowest infection rate. And my health officials are saying, We hope people from [GPE] do not come here. [INTERVIEWED1]? [INTERVIEWER4]. Business owners. How many businesses did you call and what kind of reception did you get? I am sorry, a little louder, [INTERVIEWER4], please. What kind of reception did you get from business owners that you called about shutting down and staying shut down? Oh. People send me texts and videos and pictures. And they were sending me texts and videos of particular restaurants and bars at particular times. We got [CARDINAL], 000 complaints from people, which is a very interesting phenomenon, by the way. We have never gotten [CARDINAL] 000 complaints. Sometimes when I say something really absurd, but not even [CARDINAL]. People are concerned, people are scared. So now they see a business doing the wrong thing, they snap a picture, right? Everybody has a phone and a camera. They snap a picture. They are doing complaints, [CARDINAL] complaints. Some of them actually text them to me. So I made a few phone calls and said to restaurant owners, bar owners, What are you doing? We have the guidelines. I am looking at a picture of your establishment taken [TIME]. I am looking at a picture of your establishment, taken [TIME], and people are violating everything. Everything. No masks, no social distancing. You are violating the rules. What are you doing? And look, the state is going to enforce the rules, the state licenses bars and restaurants for a liquor license, state liquor authority. You can lose your liquor license. You lose your liquor license, that is serious. So I just wanted to make sure they knew the laws and the rules. I wanted to make sure they knew that the state was going to be sending out inspectors. And this was a very serious sanction. And even their patrons do not respect it. That is what is interesting here. The people of the state know what they did. They know the sacrifice they made over [DATE] to get that virus down. And they do not want anyone's irresponsibility to jeopardize that. The reciprocity is real. I have been with people, somebody walks by does not have a mask, they are outraged. I think that is why there were so many complaints. There are a lot of conscientious people who paid a very high price, did the right thing and they do not want other people ruining it for them. What kind of response did you get from business owners? Little disbelief, little shock that this would have communicated that quickly. And frankly, that I would have called, but no denial. They would say, We told people. Was their best response, but what does that mean? We told people? They are your patrons, in your establishment, you are responsible. [INTERVIEWED1], how would social distancing be enforced on the bike path? Like any other path, like any other park, stay [QUANTITY] apart when you cannot wear a mask. [INTERVIEWED1], any barricades separating direction from [GPE] and [GPE] or with bikers and pedestrians? Do you want to answer, [INTERVIEWED2]? Yeah, no, there are not. As an example [DATE], when we opened the path, we are going to have staff all across the shared use path to make sure reinforcing that people need to stay socially distancing. We also have signage out there as well. I am sorry. That is the way that is already staffed, that is monitoring? Yeah. Okay, thank you. [INTERVIEWED1], [PERSON] confirmed to us that several private schools have reopened under the phase [CARDINAL] religious gathering allowance. We have also have videos of [CARDINAL] of kids going in, buses with backpacks and masks. There is also another video we got a huge wedding at [ORG] [DATE] with [CARDINAL] in attendance. [GPE] says [PERSON] is in state's police's jurisdiction, why is not state police enforcing your executive order? Well, first, local governments have the primary responsibility for enforcement. That is the law. And I have said a number of times, local governments have to do their job. My father's advice to me, Take responsibility, own it. I have taken responsibility for every bad decision and every unpopular decision, right? I am the one who closed down. I am the one who sets all these rules. Everybody's angry at me. Fine. The [CARDINAL] thing I need the local government to do is actually enforce them. Now, they do not want to enforce them because they are not popular. Nobody wants to go to the bar and say, you guys have to wear a mask. You guys, guys being gender neutral, are violating the social distancing. I get it. But they have to do their job. Any religious group, any community, they have to do their job. If they need backup help by the state police because they cannot handle it, then we will provide state police backup help, but they have to do their job. I cannot use the state police everywhere in this state. We do not have enough state police. I need the local governments to do their job. [CARDINAL] more then we are going to cut a ribbon. Hey, [INTERVIEWED1], in chatting with any of the restaurant owners or bar owners about lack of social distancing and not wearing masks, did any of them counter to you by saying, Well, where is your call on your request to the protestors who had been gathering and not really social distancing and in some cases wearing masks? Should not the rules be the same for the protestors as they are for the bar owners and restaurant owners? They did not say that because they listened to my briefings. And because I have said to the protestors on a number of occasions, you should be wearing masks. And by the way, I said to the police, you should be wearing masks, even on a symbolic level. You want other people to comply with the law, you are going to enforce the law, adhere to the law. Wear a mask police officer and protester. Just kidding you. [INTERVIEWED1], can you give us your impression of the bridge path. And do you think it will have an impact on the black [inaudible [TIME]] [GPE] economy? I think, and I will ask [INTERVIEWED2] to chime in because he sees it more closely. I think the bridge has had a tremendous positive impact on the entire regional economy. People, the commute is shorter. It is better for the environment. It is saving money. The bridge is beautiful. People are coming to restaurants, et cetera, just to see the bridge, especially before this COVID situation. And I think that pedestrian path is going to be a home run. There are other pedestrian passes on the Hudson that attract people just to walk over the Hudson. They are just a pedestrian path and people, by the [CARDINAL], go just to walk over the Hudson. Here, you can walk over the Hudson on a beautiful bridge, you can see [GPE] to the South, the Hudson Valley to the North. Yeah, I think you are going to get [CARDINAL] of people who come and they will stop and local shops and they will stop in restaurants and they will stop in bars. [INTERVIEWED2]. Yeah, I think the [INTERVIEWED1] nailed it. There is been a tremendous amount of interest in the opening of this path, from beyond the people that live in this region. So in addition to what the [INTERVIEWED1] pointed out, one of the things that we have in our kiosks that are at each of the [FAC], information related to local shopping dining, et cetera, because we want to help support the local tourism industry as well. But there is no question that this will have a positive impact on the economy here in this region. Thank you guys. Thank you. We are going to cut a ribbon. Speaker [CARDINAL]: Can you respond to Mayor [PERSON]'s assertion that you need to calm down regarding [DATE] violations of social distancing? That I Sorry who said that? Speaker [CARDINAL]: Mayor [PERSON] [PERSON] asserted that you should calm down regarding [DATE] violations of social distancing. What you were just referring to. I do not know what he said. I know Look at the facts. Look at our viral infection rate. Look at the other [CARDINAL] states and you do not want to be [CARDINAL] of those [CARDINAL] states. Do your job local governments. Masks up. Okay. On [CARDINAL]. [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL], [CARDINAL]. Good job. Well done.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentspressbriefingpresssecretaryjaycarney241", "text": "Good [TIME], everyone. Thanks for being here. I will go straight to questions as I have no announcements. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED1]. I am sure you saw [TIME] that the [ORG] voted for the filibuster on gun legislation. Any reaction to that? Well, as you saw on the President's statement [DATE] and as you have seen [DATE] from the President and the rest of us, we have been encouraged by bipartisan progress on this very important package of proposals. There is still work to be done. This was simply -- while very important -- a first stage in an effort to get sensible, common-sense legislation that would reduce gun violence in [GPE] while protecting [NORP]' Second Amendment rights signed into law. But we certainly welcome this development. And now that everybody has their cards out on the table in terms of the budget, is there going to be -- do you think that there will be some kind of push for negotiations in the short term on a grand bargain? Or will this kind of linger until [DATE] when we have to raise the debt ceiling again? Well, the President is interested in reaching a bipartisan compromise built around the principles that are clear in his budget proposal as soon as possible. There is regular order at work now. The [ORG] has passed a budget. The [ORG] has passed a budget. The President has presented a budget. And there is an opportunity to move forward and find common ground. The President has been engaged in a process of having conversations with lawmakers of both parties; in this case, reaching out directly to [NORP] lawmakers to find out if they are open to the general principle that we should approach our deficit challenges in a balanced way so that we can protect seniors, secure the middle class, allow our economy to grow, and reduce the deficit in a responsible way. That is the President's approach that is embodied in the budget that he presented [DATE]. So whose court is the ball in now? Is it incumbent upon [NORP] to -- he said in [FAC] [DATE] that he wants to see [NORP] in [DATE] show that they are serious about deficit reduction. So do they have to take some action now to get things going? I would refer you to what the President said. We believe that the President's budget proposal, which incorporates the offer that he made to Speaker [PERSON] at [DATE] -- which by any definition represents a good faith effort that meets the [NORP] at least halfway -- that therefore the [NORP] ought to examine that and let the [NORP] people know whether or not they are too interested in finding common ground rather than embracing ideological purity. I mean, there is [CARDINAL] way to do this in a responsible way that protects the middle class, protects seniors, that makes the necessary investments in our economy that will allow it to grow now and in the future, and that is represented by the President's budget -- a budget that I think you have seen in commentary has been recognized as a compromise proposition. It is not his ideal budget. It is not a wish list. It is an attempt to find common ground so that we can deal with our fiscal challenges on behalf of the whole country and move forward. And the immigration [ORG] has agreed that before anybody that is here illegally can be on a path to a green card, that we need to have [PERCENT] surveillance of our border in [GPE], and I think it is [PERCENT] apprehension rate, which seems like a pretty high bar to meet. Is that requirement in line with the President's vision for what a real path to citizenship is? Well, the President believes, as he made clear in his blueprint that has been available publicly for a long time now, that there has to be a clear pathway to citizenship available; that comprehensive immigration reform must include both that and must continue the focus that he is placed on border security. I would note that there are a variety of ways to measure improvements and progress when it comes to security. And we can point you to a number of facts, which are that apprehensions are down by [PERCENT] since [DATE] and down [PERCENT] since [DATE]. And, at the same time, we have increased boots on the ground along the border to [CARDINAL] 000 personnel. That is more than at any time in our history. This is progress that has been broadly recognized by [NORP] and [NORP], and demonstrates the President's commitment to border security. When it comes to the actual legislation, we wait for that legislation to be produced, and we will assess it when it is. We absolutely commend the progress that has been made, but the President remains committed to the proposition that the result has to be a bill that can earn bipartisan support as well as his signature. And we hope that process moves forward. [INTERVIEWED1], you saw the reaction [DATE], probably from many reporters, on the chained CPI inclusion in the budget. Even [CARDINAL] [NORP] congressman called it an attack on seniors. Is there any concern at [ORG] that this is something that will make it -- that [NORP] will use to avoid the grand bargain and even to hurt [NORP] politically? The President's budget represents a compromise. The inclusion of entitlement reform, specifically chained CPI and means testing of [ORG], comes at the specific behest and request of [NORP] leaders, as you know. Back in [DATE], Speaker of the [ORG] [PERSON] said that he wants to use a new method of calculating benefits for entitlement programs known as chained CPI. Again, a [NORP] congressionalist is citing another news source, [ORG]. A [NORP] congressional aide said that [PERSON] is pressing harder for the CPI revision than for other entitlement changes. [PERSON], [ORG] Minority Leader -- this is quoting [ORG] -- said bipartisan agreement on higher [ORG] premiums for the wealthy and increase in the [ORG] eligibility age, and slowing cost-of-living increases for [ORG] could move both parties closer to a budget deal. And by that, a budget deal he meant and everyone meant in [DATE] of [DATE], a budget deal that would be balanced and include revenues, which obviously was part of the President's approach. [PERSON] said again that chained CPI was something that he wanted as part of a broader deal. So this is a [NORP] proposal. And cynical attempts to make it otherwise by some represent I think dissonance within [ORG], and we have seen plenty of condemnation from conservatives and [NORP] of that sort of flagrantly ridiculous and cynical attempt to disown a proposal that emanated from [NORP] leaders. It is the responsible thing to do to try to find common ground. To find common ground you need to meet the other side halfway. You need to accept you are not going to get everything you want. You need to accept things that the other side wants. The [CARDINAL] proposals I mentioned that [NORP] leaders said they wanted as part of a bipartisan deal that would include revenue as well as entitlement reforms -- of those [CARDINAL], the President has included [CARDINAL] in his budget. By definition, [CARDINAL] out of [CARDINAL] is [CARDINAL]. So the President expects and hopes that members of the common-sense caucus will recognize the common-sense nature of his proposal, how it demonstrates as a seriousness of purpose that should infuse everyone's efforts here in [GPE] when it comes to addressing our budget challenges, and that we can move forward. This is the spirit in which the President had dinner with [CARDINAL] [NORP] senators [TIME], the second such dinner in [DATE]. And it is the spirit in which he will approach his conversations with [NORP] going forward. Let me throw [CARDINAL] other quick issues at you. Why isthe President meeting with CEOs from the banking industry [DATE]? And what is the purpose of their meeting? Well, there is a meeting, a roundtable, that is being held with other members of the administration, and that is part of our ongoing engagement with the financial sector and with the business community. This is a regular occurrence. As you know, we engage with the business community all the time. Any particular agenda, though, for that meeting? I would have to take the question. Not that I am aware of. All right, and last quick issue. The President met [DATE] with the head of [ORG], who [DATE] expressed their opposition to the forced feeding of hunger strike inmates in [FAC]. What reaction did the President give to that opposition in their meeting [DATE]? First of all, what I can tell you is that you know our commitment to close [FAC]. It is a commitment shared by the former President, by military leaders, and other [NORP], including Senator [PERSON]. And we continue to be committed to closing that facility in our national security interests. I do not have any specific response to what is happening now, except to say that the President remains committed to closing [FAC] for national security reasons. But is he aware of this hunger strike? Is he following it? The President obviously is updated on a number of issues. I have not had a specific conversation with him about this. In the [DATE] campaign, the President, then-candidate [PERSON], issued a statement saying, I will not touch [ORG]. So a number of [NORP] are now accusing the President of breaking his word. They feel betrayed. You just said it was a [NORP] proposal, so why is a [NORP] President issuing a [NORP] budget? Because he is President of the whole country, and he believes we need to reach a budget compromise that is balanced, that allows the economy to grow, that secures a rising and thriving middle class, and invests in the economy of the future while reducing our deficits in a responsible way. His budget is proof that you can do that; that you do not need to take the path embodied by the [ORG] [NORP] budget, which would dramatically slice investments in education; would block grant [ORG], cut it dramatically, harming families who have children with disabilities; would voucherize [ORG], shifting costs onto seniors at an average of [MONEY] per year, all the while giving a massive tax break to wealthy individuals and the most well-connected. But is it getting the nation anywhere closer to a deal? Well, he believes he is because it represents compromise and an attempt to find common ground. It is incumbent upon [NORP] to do the same -- to, in the spirit of compromise and a desire for progress, to meet the President halfway and to accept that they will not get what they want, that the document they passed in the [ORG] is maybe satisfying in an ideological way, but it is not in any way representative of either what the [NORP] people broadly support or what could ever become law here in [GPE], and that instead, they ought to embrace the idea of balance. It is not the President's ideal approach. There is no -- But is this who he really is, and progressives are misunderstanding what he truly believes in? The President believes that it is in the overall interest of the nation's economy and middle class that we reach a budget deal of the kind the he presented [DATE]. And the reason that is, is because we need to continue to grow the economy and create jobs. That is the best thing we can do for middle-class families and for the people he fights for [DATE]. In order to achieve that deal, he recognizes he will have to make some tough choices and that [NORP] will have to accept things that they would not otherwise want to do; but so, too, will [NORP]. [NORP] who suggest that the only way to move forward in deficit reduction is to put the burden entirely on seniors and the middle class are wrong, and it will not be accepted and it is not an approach that this President will accept. And it is an approach that, by the way, was the center of debate for [DATE] in a presidential election and the [NORP] people roundly rejected it. So it is not his ideal budget. He has accepted as part of his offer to the Speaker of the [ORG], which is included in his budget proposal, a compromise position and entitlement reforms that he can accept as part of a broader deal that asks everybody to participate in the effort and that invests in our economy, and secures and enhances the middle class. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED1]. The cloture was invoked with a pretty strong margin. Does the President have any sense of whether the voices from [GPE], whether public attitudes really did make any impact on the [ORG]? Did he raise it with the senators [TIME]? And is it premature to think that the [ORG]'s voice in [ORG] is not as strong as it used to be? I would say a couple of things. The President has no doubt whatsoever that the voices of the Newtown families and the voices of [NORP] across the country that were raised [DATE] as part of an effort to urge the [ORG] to move forward, and not block procedurally the progress on this legislation, had a positive effect and may well have been decisive. The President has said all along, and you heard him in [GPE] on [DATE], that [ORG] will do the right thing if the [NORP] people speak up, if they raise their voices, if they make their views known. And as he said then, it is not about him; it is about the [NORP] people and what the right, common-sense thing is to do when it comes to taking action to reduce gun violence. On the second part, as I said to [PERSON], this is an important milestone, but it is an early milestone. And there is no question that challenges will continue to be placed in the way of making progress on passing common-sense legislation that would reduce gun violence. But we are obviously very pleased with [DATE]'s vote. Does the President have real concerns about the assault weapons ban, the size of ammunition clips, as being things that will not be able to move forward? The President believes that those are common-sense proposals. Reinstatement of the assault weapons ban makes eminent sense. Making sure that military-style assault weapons are not available on the streets of [GPE] is a common-sense approach. It does not infringe upon [NORP]' Second Amendment rights. Limiting the size of ammunition clips will save lives, and it is not an infringement on the Second Amendment rights of the [NORP] people. The President strongly supports Second Amendment rights. So he insists -- as the [NORP] people insist, as the families of the victims of [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] and [GPE] and [ORG], and so many other places across the country insist -- that [ORG] on each of these holds itself to account, that senators vote on these aspects of the legislation, that they do not filibuster or use other procedural measures to avoid being held to account. And if they have to vote no, they should vote no and explain why, rather than hide behind procedure and other parliamentary tricks to obscure what is really happening. On the question that [PERSON] asked about immigration, do you want to state a position on this apparent agreement [ORG] has come up on border security? Well, there is an apparent agreement that -- I mean, if you have the bill to show me, I'd be interested to take it with me and bring it back here. But we will await legislation and we will evaluate it when it emerges. We are encouraged by the process. The President's commitment to border security is evident not just in his blueprint, which makes clear that border security -- So you do not want to weigh in [CARDINAL] way or the other, whether they should include it or not? Again, border security absolutely must be part of comprehensive immigration. But I mean, this particular metric. If you have legislation that demonstrates what is in it, I'd be interested in seeing it. My understanding is that legislation has not been produced. They are still working on it. When it emerges, we will evaluate it. What is a take-away from the dinner [TIME]? A different group of senators -- do you think this is something that is gaining momentum? The President feels like it is a worthwhile exercise and it is not just a sort of for-show thing? Well, it is certainly not for show in the President's mind. The President believes that both dinners and all of his engagements with [NORP] have been constructive and useful. He is very much of the mind that exploring the possibility of finding common ground is in the interest of the [NORP] people and the [NORP] economy, and it is in the interest of trying to find bipartisan solutions to a whole range of issues, not just our budget and fiscal challenges -- but immigration reform, reducing gun violence, taking steps to enhance [GPE]'s energy independence and security, making sure that we continue to invest in education and research and development. So there are a variety of arenas here where the possibility of bipartisan compromise exists. In spite of the polarization that does pertain here in [GPE], it is also the case that whether it is on gun violence and the vote that we have talked about that happened [DATE], or on immigration reform, or within the context of at least the discussions that the President has been having, there is at least evidence of the potential for bipartisan cooperation. And the President believes that is important. Did either [CARDINAL] of the dinners in of themselves propel what we saw on the [ORG] floor [DATE] on gun control or the progress being made on immigration? I would not presume, on the President's behalf, to suggest that any single meal he had with lawmakers led to a specific result. The work that is been done on reducing gun violence in the [ORG] is to the credit of those who have been engaged in that work on [ORG]. We have obviously been engaged with them in that work. The same holds for progress being made on immigration reform. As the President made clear when he talked about it from the beginning after the election, he wanted to see progress emerge from the [ORG] through the [ORG] process because he believed that would produce the best opportunity for bipartisan legislation that reflected his principles and that he could sign. And that progress is being made. So the credit is widespread, but we should not be assigning credit yet. We are not at the finish line in any of these areas yet. We need to keep pressing so that [ORG] keeps moving and hopefully produces legislation that the [NORP] people will support, that [ORG] will vote for, and that the President can sign. I want to talk to you about [GPE] before I let you go. Has it been the President's intention -- because we have not heard him speak to this issue directly for [DATE] -- to not, by staying out of public eye and staying out of this in an audible sense, avoid anything that can be either misinterpreted or just not engaged to suggest to [NORP] that he is rising to their level? I mean, even analysts who are very accustomed to this cycle of provocation and rhetoric do feel that this looks, sounds, and appears different than other cases. And the average [NORP], they are hearing a lot of things that may unnerve them, and yet they have not heard from the President of [GPE]. Is he intentionally staying out of this for some strategic communication reason? The President has been directing his national security team to take necessary precautionary measures that will ensure that we can both defend ourself and our allies -- defend ourselves and our allies, defend the homeland. And I think that represents the fact that he is concerned about the stepped-up rhetoric and the provocative behavior by the [NORP] regime. It is also the case that what we have seen of late from [GPE] represents a familiar pattern of behavior. And as you refer to it as cycles, and I think that is an appropriate way to describe it, we have seen this kind of cycle in the past. It is always unhelpful. It is always destabilizing, and it is never in the interest of the [NORP] people. It only serves to further isolate [GPE] and to undermine any hope the [NORP] regime has of reentering the community of nations and assuring the international community that it intends to abide by the obligations that it has made. So we are taking necessary steps -- But is it in the interest of the President not to talk about it and talk to the country about it? I think the President has made clear through the actions of his administration and this government, through the variety of means that have been reported on and the steps that we have taken, the seriousness with which we take this. It is also important to note, as I said, that we have seen a pattern of -- this is reflective of a pattern of behavior that has been going on for quite some time from [GPE]. Is this a top issue with [PERSON] [TIME] [DATE]? I believe there will be a number of issues discussed with the [ORG] Secretary General. This is certainly one of them. It is an issue that [ORG] took up not very long ago, passing a resolution condemning [NORP] behavior and sanctioning [GPE] that was unanimous, that included affirmative votes from both the [NORP] and the [NORP]. And we are working with our allies in [GPE] and [GPE], as well as with [GPE] and [GPE] to try to bring about a change in behavior from [NORP], asking especially the [NORP] and the [NORP] to use the influence they have, the unique influence they have with [NORP] to prevail upon [GPE] to ratchet down the rhetoric and the behavior, because it is in the interest of every nation in the region that there be stability in the region, and that there ultimately be a Korean Peninsula that is denuclearized. Following on the [PERSON] meeting -- Sure. On another topic, [GPE], which obviously is likely to come up -- been a lot of reports [DATE] suggesting that the [GPE] is increasing its aid to the rebels. And obviously, there is an important distinction about nonlethal aid, lethal aid. Can you be direct with us about how significant you see this increase in aid? And what does it mean? I appreciate the question. The President himself has said that we are constantly reviewing possible options that could help end the violence and accelerate a political transition in [GPE]. We have provided [MONEY] in nonlethal assistance to the [NORP] opposition thus far and have been steadily increasing that assistance to help the opposition become stronger, more cohesive, and more organized. And as Secretary [PERSON] announced in [GPE], soon we will be providing food rations and medical kits to both the coalition and to the opposition's supreme military council in order to feed the hungry and tend to the sick and wounded. The President has directed his national security team to identify additional measures to continue increasing nonlethal assistance to assist the operation -- the opposition, rather. So I think that addresses your question. The President -- we have continued to ratchet up. We are on an upward trajectory with our assistance, both humanitarian assistance to the [NORP] people and direct assistance --nonlethal assistance -- to the [NORP] opposition. And we will continue to step up that assistance. The President has directed his team to identify additional measures that we can take to increase that assistance, and we will have a decision to announce in the future. I do not have an announcement to make [DATE]. Quick related question on that. DNI [PERSON] was on the [FAC] [DATE], and in some important testimony he said directly that if [PERSON] falls, he said, it is a tough call whether or not the chemical weapons stockpile can be secured. How worried are you about that? It sounds like a pretty dramatic statement from the [ORG]. Well, there is no question, as we have stated all along, that the disposition of chemical weapons in [GPE] is a matter of concern to [GPE] and our allies and partners -- a matter of great concern obviously to countries in the region. And we have made clear, as the President did I believe from this podium, that the use or proliferation of chemical weapons is a red line as far as he is concerned when it comes to the [NORP] regime. I would point you to what Director [PERSON] said. I will not engage in hypotheticals about [DATE] when [PERSON] is finally -- or when [GPE] is finally rid of [PERSON] and what will happen. But you can be sure that the disposition of those weapons will be a matter of focus and concern for this nation, as well as many others. [CARDINAL] other quick topics. [ORG] has released some documents that they obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request with the [ORG], where [ORG] agents claim they can go through people's emails and text messages without a warrant. Is [ORG] concerned about the IRA making that claim in terms of people's privacy? I would have to take the question. I am not aware of the story or the documents that were obtained, and I would certainly refer you to the [ORG] as a starting point. Last thing -- and this may be in the same boat on. There is a [NORP] family, came to [GPE] in [DATE] seeking asylum because they did not like [NORP] public schools. The reason why it relates to [ORG] is they got asylum, it was then overturned, and there is a chance they are going to be deported. And there is a petition at whitehouse.gov, an online petition, and it is gotten [CARDINAL] signatures saying they want the President to intervene so that this family does not have to go back to [GPE]. They think the public schools -- they have been home-schooling their kids here in [GPE], and they do not like the [NORP] public schools. It is reached [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] signatures. What is the process for reacting to something like that? And are you aware of this specific case? I am not aware of it. I will certainly take the question. We do have a threshold beyond which we respond to We the People= petitions, and if that threshold is crossed, I am sure we will respond. But I do not have a specific comment on this case. [INTERVIEWED1], thanks. [ORG] Secretary [PERSON] said of [GPE] that it is skating very close to a dangerous line. Does the President share that assessment? And has he identified a red line, a line by which [GPE] crossing that would be unacceptable? Well, I will not engage in hypotheticals about what red lines there are. It is unacceptable to flagrantly violate your international commitments, as [GPE] continues to do. And the result of that behavior has been increasing international consensus around the proposition that [GPE] flagrant violations of its obligations must stop. That has resulted in increased isolation and sanctions. It has resulted in all the range of actions that we have taken in response to the recent series of provocative acts and statements. There is no question that [GPE] -- because of its development of a nuclear weapon, because of its violation of its commitments, its development of missile technology -- represents a danger and a threat. And that is why we address it the way that we do. So I think that the words of Secretary [PERSON] are reflective of the administration's view of this problem. It is why we have taken the actions that we have taken to ensure that we can enhance both the security of both the homeland and our allies. And we will continue to take necessary, prudent measures as the situation demands. Well, I guess getting at it from a different angle, the President has identified a clear red line when it comes to [GPE], for example. So why not lay down a similar marker in this instance, given the provocations? I am not sure what you are asking, because the President identified a clear red line about chemical weapons -- the use of or proliferation of the chemical weapons that the [NORP] regime possesses. [GPE] is already in flagrant violation of its international obligations. It is engaged in the development of nuclear weapons. It is engaged in development of missile technology that is in contradiction to its commitments. And that is why you see the international response that you have seen. And we will continue to work with our allies in [GPE] and [GPE], as well as with partners in the region and around the world, to attempt to prevail upon [GPE] to choose a different path. That path, by the way, is open to [GPE]. There is an opportunity for [GPE] to give up a path that has resulted in isolation and impoverishment for [GPE], and rather to abide by its obligations and therefore enter the international community or rejoin it, and improve the lot of its people. And we hope that [GPE] takes that path. Going back to the budget -- if the budget is a first offer of sorts and the President has already put chained CPI on the table, where does he go in negotiations? Is he willing to offer anything more when it comes to entitlements? It has been asked in the past whether this is a starting point. It is not a starting point. It is a sticking point. The President's budget represents a fair-minded, serious offer at trying to find common ground with [NORP]. The [NORP] people expect and support a balanced approach to deficit reduction. The [NORP] people expect their leaders in [GPE] to protect senior citizens, to protect the middle class. They certainly do not expect or support an approach that would put the burden of deficit reduction on seniors and the middle class. They support investments in education and innovation, in infrastructure that the President has within his budget. They support universal access to pre-K for [GPE]'s children, because that is good for the children now and it is good for the development of our economy in the future. The President's budget is a common-sense document that represents a sincere attempt to compromise with [NORP] on behalf of the whole country. The fact is it is not an la carte menu, as I think [PERSON] said [DATE] in our briefing. When the [NORP] leadership said during fiscal cliff negotiations that when it came to entitlement reforms, that they wanted the President to go along with chained CPI and means testing of [ORG] as part of an agreement that would include revenues, the as part of part is very important. That is what the President believes. It has to be not just revenues on the [CARDINAL] hand and entitlement reforms on the other, but the whole approach has to be embraced -- a balanced approach that allows for investments so that our economy can grow, that allows for the kind of security for the middle class and seniors that is so essential. And it allows for the guarantee that those programs represent to our seniors to continue into the future. So the [NORP] have to decide -- and there are rank-and-file [NORP] who believe this already, but [NORP] including leadership has to decide whether they want to find compromise or they would rather stick to positions that are at odds with where most of [GPE] is, and are certainly at odds with where the President is. Is the President confident he can get his own party on board with this, given the backlash? Does he need to start having dinner with them? The President is confident that -- as he was during the fiscal cliff negotiations, as he was in previous negotiations with the Speaker of the [ORG] -- that [NORP] will support a bipartisan compromise that ensures that our assistance programs to our seniors are safeguarded, and that that guarantee is provided; that ensure that investments in education are made, and investments in innovation and research and development and infrastructure are made. So the answer is yes. The budget represents tough choices, there is no question. But it also expects from the other side that they make tough choices. Back to the CEO meeting [TIME] -- I know [INTERVIEWER2] had asked a question -- but I was wondering, did the President plan to bring up unemployment with the executives, and did he talk up his budget a bit with them? Do you know? I was not in the meeting. I do not have a readout of it. We have a strategy of engagement with the business sector that is ongoing and this is part of that strategy. I certainly would not be surprised if some of these matters came up. The need to deal with growing the economy and creating jobs is his [CARDINAL] priority. So I am going to go out on a limb and say that this is something that he would want to talk about. And it is certainly his belief, as you saw embodied in his budget document, that we need to reduce our deficit, but do it in a way that allows our economy to grow and secure the middle class. A readout on that? I will take the question and we will see. Yes, [PERSON]. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED1]. Just staying with the business meeting for a moment, can you talk about why it is important for the President -- or if the President believes it is important to do this outreach to business? And also, do you think that the outreach in the second term has stepped up or we are seeing more of it than we did in the first term? I think the outreach that we have seen has been ongoing. And our outreach includes not just obviously to business, but to a whole range of sectors of the [NORP] economy and a variety of groups with different interests. And that is as it should be and continues. I think what you have seen from [ORG] is an engagement with business around the simple proposition that we need to take steps to reform our immigration system because that is good for the economy and good for the middle class. We need to take steps to reduce gun violence, and there are some business leaders who are very much interested in that effort. And we need to take common-sense steps to grow our economy and reduce our deficit, and that is obviously of interest to the business sector. Thanks. [INTERVIEWED1], on drone strikes, I wanted to ask you about -- the President has said that the only targets of drone strikes are senior operational leaders of [ORG] and associated forces whom you know are involved somehow in some plotting of attacks against the [GPE] Can you explain why classified [GPE] intelligence documents that [ORG] has reviewed suggest otherwise? I, as you would expect, am not going to talk about classified documents that others would have obtained. I can tell you that our strategy in dealing with counterterrorism is to utilize the tools available to us. When it comes to the means with which we do that, the President has addressed it and we have been, as an administration, very transparent through a series of speeches by [PERSON], the Attorney General and by others, as well as comments by the President, about the approach that we take in that effort. But can you explain -- some of the documents suggested that there -- Again, [INTERVIEWER8], you are not going to get me to comment on classified information. Any legal justification, though, for strikes that suggest you have been working with [GPE] and targeting their insurgents -- Again, I do not have any comment on what you are representing as classified information. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED1]. Returning to [PERSON] and [PERSON] -- [PERSON] released a rap [DATE]. I know [DATE] you said that [ORG] was the one that cleared their trip. He suggested that he got [ORG] clearance and that he personally spoke with the President. I will just quote: I turned [GPE] into Atlanta/ Boy from the hood got [ORG] clearance/ [PERSON] said, '[PERSON], you gonna get me impeached'/ You do not need this [expletive] anyway/ Chill with me on the beach. I guess nothing rhymes with [ORG]. Because [ORG] offers and gives licenses for travel, as you know, and [ORG] has nothing to do with it. So are you saying that he did not -- the President did not have a conversation with [PERSON]? I am absolutely saying that [ORG], from the President on down, had nothing to do with anybody's personal -- anybody's travel to [GPE]. That is something that [ORG] handles. You cannot rhyme that? [ORG], [ORG] -- these are tough words to rhyme. Did he communicate with -- It is a song, [PERSON]. The President did not communicate with [PERSON] over this trip. [INTERVIEWED1]? Yes.[INTERVIEWER4], do you have something? Oh, good. Let me read this while I have it, which is in answer -- or part answer about our response to the cloture vote. I wanted to let you know that following the [ORG]'s cloture vote, President [PERSON] spoke by phone with family members of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy who are here in [GPE], [GPE] to ask [ORG] to pass common-sense measures to reduce gun violence. The President congratulated the families on this important step forward, noting that the bipartisan progress would not have been possible without their efforts. He reiterated that much work remains, and pledged to continue fighting for the votes they deserve. Just to follow up on [GPE], [ORG] in [GPE] released on [DATE] a statement saying they were joining in [GPE] some opposition groups. What is your reaction? And how can you make sure that the money you are going to provide to some opposition groups are not going to end up in those [ORG] supporters? Well, we work with [ORG], and we obviously are interested in helping and assisting in their consolidation and organization and their overall efforts -- the opposition in [GPE] that is committed to democratic principles and that is committed to a brighter and more democratic future for [GPE]. There is no question, and this is a concern around the region, that extremist elements try to take advantage of, in a variety of areas, including [GPE], the kind of upheaval that you have seen in a tragedy like [GPE]. And that is obviously of concern to us, and we monitor it regularly. But we are focused on assisting the opposition, [ORG], and the members of the broader [NORP] opposition that are committed to a more democratic future for [GPE]. And I just have another question related to huge breaking news in [GPE] and Europe at this moment. The budget minister of [PERSON] lied to the people in [GPE] about a hidden [NORP] account when he was trying to do something about the tax evasion. What is your reaction to that? And what will you say for public officials in terms of probity? Well, I am not aware of that and I will not comment on what seems to be an internal matter in [GPE]. So I really do not have a response. [INTERVIEWED1]? Yes, [INTERVIEWER1]. I have [CARDINAL] questions. Thank you, sir. [CARDINAL], [DATE], [CARDINAL] of minorities from [GPE], including [NORP], [NORP] and [NORP], were demonstrating outside [FAC]. What they were saying, a message for the President that it should read that they are being targeted in [GPE] because of their race and religion and their beliefs. And whenever there is a problem in [GPE] and minorities are under attack by the extremists and groups. Any comments on their -- I do not have a specific response to the demonstration. Obviously, the administration and the President support the civil rights of peoples around the world, but I am just not aware of the specific demonstration or the issues in terms of a presidential response. And as far as guns are concerned, [DATE] [CARDINAL] of [NORP] were at [FAC] celebrating the Vaisakhi, their national holiday. And talking to them, what they are saying that among them were the families of the victims from [GPE], [GPE]. What they are saying is that guns kill -- it does not matter how many rounds, and it should be banned at all completely, because as long as guns are in the wrong hands of the people, there will be -- people will be killed. And that is the message they were telling me to send to the President and to the [ORG]. The President's approach is one that embraces common-sense measures to reduce gun violence that do not infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of the [NORP] people, Second Amendment rights that the President supports. And you have seen that reflected in the legislation that he supports up on [ORG] and in the set of proposals that he made and announced together with the Vice President [DATE]. Sorry, let me move on. Just a question on the Middle East. You were asked [DATE] about the series of leaders coming to visit and talk with the President. Can you talk about the importance the President attaches to having President [PERSON] here? Will that happen possibly before the G8? He is a major Arab Spring leader. Just, generally, the importance of that? I know you are not going to read out any visit plans. Well, I have no announcements to make beyond -- about visits beyond the ones that we already have announced, and which you made note of, and that is that the President will be hosting his counterparts from the [GPE], from [GPE], [GPE] and [GPE] in [GPE] over [DATE]. There will be a variety of topics. [GPE] will certainly be [CARDINAL] of them. Our relationship with [GPE] is and has been very important, and we continue to engage with the [NORP] government. I just do not have any particular next engagement to announce to you at the presidential level. The information also of the [MONEY] in aid for [GPE] that was announced in [GPE], can you take that question and get it to us? Well, I have to take it. I am sure [ORG] would be a good place to go for more details about it. All the way back, yes. Back to the budget, if the President's deficit reduction plan is enacted, how many jobs would be lost under his plan as opposed to sequestration? The President's budget will increase job growth in [GPE]. It includes, in stark contrast to alternatives, investments that will create jobs. It includes tax cuts targeted to small businesses, for example, who hire veterans or small businesses who increase the size of their payroll, for example. It includes investments in infrastructure that will lead to immediate job creation as well as future economic growth and job creation because of the improvements in our roads, bridges, ports, and airports. So the President's -- it is an excellent question because the President's budget proposal, which contains within it his deficit reduction offer to the Speaker, has to be looked at as a whole because it is the President's [CARDINAL] priority to take measures that help the economy grow, that help it create jobs, that secure and grow the middle class, and reduce our deficit in a responsible way. And the whole point that he was trying to make, and I think he made very well in [FAC], is that you can do that. You can, if you go about it in a responsible way -- and responsible is certainly not what the sequester represents -- but if you go about deficit reduction in a responsible way, you can do it and also invest in our economy in a way that allows it to grow and create jobs. But do you have a number? Because I do not see how you can cut [MONEY] and it not cost some jobs despite the infrastructure. The fact is you can, as we have seen, reduce the deficit in a responsible way. If you do it in a responsible way and do not embrace extremist positions or absolutist positions that would do harm to economic growth and job creation, as well as compound that harm by slashing investments that the middle class depends on, or voucherizing [ORG] in a way that harms seniors, you can reduce our deficit in a responsible way that ensures that the economy will continue to grow and create jobs. And if you do it in a balanced way, in a responsible way, if you build on the [MONEY] in deficit reduction the President has already signed into law, and you add to it the [MONEY] that his deficit reduction plan represents, you will have cleared the [MONEY] threshold of deficit reduction that economists say is key to getting our fiscal situation stabilized and reducing the deficit-to-GDP ratio by [CARDINAL] to below [PERCENT]. You can do that and continue to grow the economy. And the President made clear that it is much harder and in some cases impossible to reduce our deficit if the economy is not growing. That is why we cannot take action that would do the kind of harm to the economy that, for example, the sequester does because the sequester's negative impact is due in part to its arbitrary nature, that it was written in a way that was designed purposely never to become law. You need instead to do it the way that the President has presented in his budget. Thanks, [INTERVIEWED1]. Thanks, everybody.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "trumpwhitehousearchivesgovbriefingsstatementsremarkspresidenttrumppresidentrebelodesousaportugueserepublicbilateralmeetingutmsourcelinkutmmediumheader", "text": "Thank you very much. It is a great honor to have the President - and highly respected, I must say - President of [GPE] with us. We have a tremendous relationship with [GPE] for a long time, and I would say it is never been better than it is right now. So I just want to welcome you and your delegation. It is a country of great beauty and great people. And so thank you. And if you do not mind, I will just make a quick statement of a man I also have great respect for, Justice [PERSON] - you know who I am talking about. Justice [PERSON] will be retiring. And he is a man that I have known for a long time and a man that I have respected for a long time. He is been a great justice of [ORG]. He is a man who is displaying great vision. He is displayed tremendous vision and tremendous heart. And he will be missed, but he will be retiring. And we will begin our search for a new justice of [ORG]. That will begin immediately. And hopefully we are going to pick somebody who will be as outstanding. So I just want thank Justice [PERSON] for [DATE] of tremendous service. He is a very spectacular man. Really, a spectacular man. And I know that he will be around, hopefully for a long time, to advise. And I believe he is going to be teaching and doing other things. So thank you to Justice [PERSON]. Okay? Thank you. Who will you pick to replace him, sir? Well, we have, obviously, numerous people. We have a list of [CARDINAL] people that I actually had during my election. I had [CARDINAL], and as you know, I added [CARDINAL] a little while ago. We have a very excellent list of great talented, highly educated, highly intelligent - hopefully, tremendous - people. I think the list is very outstanding. When I was running, I put down a list of [CARDINAL] people. Because not being a politician, I think people wanted to hear what some of my choices may be, and it was pretty effective. And I think you see the kind of quality that we are looking at when you look at that list. But I did add - I added [CARDINAL] additional people to the list. So it will be somebody from that list. So we have now boiled it down to [CARDINAL] people. [INTERVIEWED], to the World Cup with President [PERSON], the final? Yes - And who are you supporting in the World Cup? No, I will tell you, we fought very hard to get it here. I think they are doing a fantastic job with the World Cup right now. It is in [GPE], and I will tell you that it is exciting. My son loves soccer, and he loves watching the World Cup. And they have really done a fantastic job with the World Cup. It is exciting even if you are a non-soccer fan. I am a soccer fan a little bit, but I do not have much time. Who are you rooting for? But - well, I am rooting for everybody to do well. But I think the venue has been fantastic. They really have shown something very special. I fought very hard to get it to [GPE], [GPE], and [GPE], as you probably have heard. And we were honored to be chosen. And this is a great gentleman and a great soccer fan too. But we were very honored to be chosen for the World Cup. So we look forward to that. [INTERVIEWED], will you meet with President [PERSON], sir? And where? Most likely. [PERSON] is over there now. He is over in [GPE] right now. I just saw, watching media, that he is met with President [PERSON]. I have not gotten the full report yet. But it would look like we will probably be meeting sometime in the not-too-distant future. And I have said it from [DATE]: Getting along with [GPE] and with [GPE] and with everybody is a very good thing. It is good for the world, it is good for us, it is good for everybody. So we will probably be meeting sometime around my trip to Europe. Do you know where? No, it has not been determined yet. Probably, I will know within [TIME]. And what about the injunction on immigration? Will you fight that - the [GPE] judge who says reunited families must be put together within [DATE]? Well, we are going to see. But we believe that families should be together also. So there is not a lot to fight. But we believe families have to be together. But what we really do is we believe in very strong borders, no crime. And the [NORP] believe in open borders and plenty of crime, because that is what you get with the open borders. I would like to introduce, however, the President of [GPE]. And I am sorry to bother you, but in our country, the selection of a justice of [ORG] is considered, I think we can all say, one of the most important events - one of the most important things for our country. I mean, you see the decisions that just came down, how big they are, how vital they are. And they can swing different ways depending on who it might - whom there might be in the courts. So it is always been considered a tremendous - a tremendously important thing. Some people think outside of, obviously, war and peace, it is the most important thing that you could have. But another very important thing is introducing the [INTERVIEWED2] - the highly respected, I must say - [INTERVIEWED2]. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, [INTERVIEWED]. Well, as a constitutional law professor - Oh, very good. - I know how important it is when a justice in your [ORG] retires, because it is a key institution for your country. So I just heard the news, and I imagine how important it is for you and for any [GPE] President. Anyway, I'd like to tell you that we have a very long-lasting friendship and partnership - Yes. - that started the moment we recognized you. We were the first neutral country to recognize [GPE] independence, although we had as our oldest ally, [GPE]. So it was courageous at that time. That is right. And, I do not know if you know it, but your Founding Fathers celebrated independence with our wine - with Madeira wine. They made a toast - Good taste. - with our wine, Madeira wine. It is a long, long story, this one, of our friendship and partnership based on common values, democracy and freedom and rule of law and human rights, but also of a very strong community, of fellow citizens that are both [NORP] and [NORP] and they love [GPE] and they love [GPE]. There are [CARDINAL] [NORP] living here. They are very important. So it is not just a military, a political, and an economic alliance. It is more than that. It is something very human, because we are speaking of [CARDINAL], 000 people that they live their love for [CARDINAL] countries at the same time. As you spoke of soccer, let me then ask you something - well, make you a suggestion. Go ahead. If you are going to meet Mr. [PERSON] - well, I was with him [DATE]. Good. Yes. And he asked me to greet you. So, of course, he was expecting your visit. But anyway, do not forget that [GPE] has the best player in the world that is called [PERSON]. Oh, okay. I am sure your son knows it and - He knows all about him. And so - and so, do not forget if you ever go to [GPE] during the championship, do not forget [GPE] is still there and wanting to win the championship. That is right. They are doing very well. Yes. And they say he is doing - - and doing very, very, very well. That is very good. And so tell me, how good a player is he? Are you impressed? I am very much impressed. He is the best player in the world, [PERSON]. So in a sense - well, I think, has been a success. I do agree with you - the championship Yeah. Yeah, great. No. No. I think - I think - No doubt about it for the world - for the world. So will [PERSON] ever run for President against you? He would not win. You know he will not President, you know - you know something - I must tell you, [GPE] is not just [GPE]. That is right. That is right. It is a little different. Yes, go ahead. [INTERVIEWED], when did you learn that Justice [PERSON] would be retiring? [TIME]. Were you surprised? He came to [FAC]. We had a wonderful discussion just prior to meeting the President and really had a very deep discussion. I got his ideas on things, including - I asked him if he had certain people that he had great respect for that potentially could take his seat - which is a very hard seat to fill. So we talked about different things. And he was here for [TIME]. I do not think you folks saw him come in and out, did you? I am shocked. Boy, they have done a great job. That is a shocker. That is a shocker. But, yeah, we had a - he just left a little while ago, just prior to meeting the President. Will you tell us who he recommended? Will you give us any sense of - No, I will not do that. But he has - you know, there are certain names that are just outstanding - names that you already know, to be honest with you. I mean, there are names that you know that are outstanding, highly respected - names that you would know, President. And we will be looking at them; we will be looking at some others. But they will come from the list of [CARDINAL] people. Okay? [INTERVIEWED], it is [DATE]. Would you give consideration to holding that spot open until the makeup of [ORG] is determined come [DATE]? I have not really thought about that. I think you want to go as quickly as possible. It is a process, but have not really thought of that. But we had [DATE] [DATE], very big. We had a great decision [DATE], in terms of what was just released by [ORG]. [DATE], obviously, with the travel ban was extremely big. And we had some tremendous elections. [GPE], from my own standpoint, [GPE] - the governor, [PERSON] - It was a big win. And as you know, I was very much involved in [GPE] with the Congressman, [PERSON]. So we are very happy. We are - this was [DATE], and now I get to cap it off by meeting with the President of [GPE]. And [GPE] has been actually very important to our nation. And you are right, we have [CARDINAL] people from [GPE] here. So that is very important. Do you have a message to [ORG] [NORP] who have failed to pass the immigration bill earlier? No, I want them to do what they wanted. You know, the problem we have - and I told them [TIME], I said, Hey, pass it, if you can. But I also want them to do what they want. We have a big immigration bill, like everybody does - like you are talking and everybody talks about immigration now, I think, more than ever before. I told them - [TIME], I said, Look, pass something or come back with something that would be a derivation, but get something you want. The problem we have is we need [NORP] votes in the [ORG], and that is why I do not get overly excited with the [ORG] bill right now, because it is not going to pass in the [ORG]. You are not going to get the [NORP] to vote for anything. If we gave them [PERCENT] of what they wanted, and then doubled it, they still would not pass it because they think it is a good election point. I think it is good for us because I think strong borders - I do not even know how you feel about that, but I think strong borders and no crime is - that is us. And I think that is going to be a great election point for us. So I told them [TIME], I said, You know, do what you want, and ultimately we will come to something. And perhaps it'll be after the election, maybe it'll be before. But as of this moment, [NORP] are not going to vote for anything, because they really are resisting or obstructing. Okay? Thank you very much. [PERSON] said he does not expect a specific outcome from your meeting with President [PERSON]. Do you expect an outcome? Well, I think we will be talking about [GPE]. I think we will be talking about [GPE]. I think we will be talking about many other subjects. And we will see what happens. So you never know. Election meddling? You never know about meetings, what happens. Right? But I think a lot of good things can come with meetings with people. We had great meetings with President [PERSON] of [GPE]. We have - every place I have been, we have had great meetings. So maybe something positive will come out of it. [INTERVIEWED], what about the progressive challenger that beat [PERSON], that young woman from [GPE]? Are you worried about a blue wave? Does that - Well, that was a shocker. Losing - for [PERSON] to lose that election, that was a shocker. I was surprised. Everybody was surprised. We had somebody that is been in there for [DATE], [INTERVIEWED], and I think he probably took it for granted. And I cannot say that I am disappointed because I was never a big fan, but he lost his election. Probably should not have lost his election. Maybe you get a little complacent, you know? That does happen; you get complacent. And he lost. That is a big loss. I tell you what, that is an amazing - that was a shocking loss. But it is what it is. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Sir, [INTERVIEWED], are you worried your tariffs are backfiring? No, they are doing great. By the way, the steel industry is absolutely doing great. The tariffs have been incredible. And the steel industry is doing great, and our country is doing great. You are seeing the results. The numbers coming out from the companies are far beyond what anybody ever thought possible. We are doing really good. But we have to have fair trade deals, and we working on really fair trade deals. We are working with your representatives on fair trade deals. So - Oh, I heard you are going to receive President . That is good news. Yes. Yes. Yes. That is good news. Must speak with . Thank you everybody. They are working - it is going to be very good. It is going be good. And, [INTERVIEWED], as far as when you might meet with [PERSON], will it be after [ORG]? Probably after. Right after [ORG], you think? Probably after. Thank you, sir. Thank you everybody. Thank you very much. [GPE]? Could be. Or [GPE]. Or [GPE]? It will be announced very soon.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "abcnewsgocomPoliticsweektranscriptobamasenioradviserdavidplouffestoryid18241822", "text": "Good to see you, [INTERVIEWED1]. Good to see you, [INTERVIEWER1]. Thanks for having me. So just lay out the vision the president expects to deliver to the nation [DATE]. Well, I think he is going to talk about how our founding principles and values can still guide us in [DATE]'s modern and changing world. We do look at this and the State of the Union as a package, so I think in the inaugural, he is going to lay out his vision for a second term. The detailed blueprint and ideas will be in the State of the Union, so I do think you have to view these as a package. He is going to say that our political system does not require us to resolve all of our differences or settle all of our disputes, but it is absolutely imperative that our leaders try and seek common ground when it can and should exist. That is going to be a very important part of the speech. You have been with the president all through this journey, and I was struck by something that his biographer, [PERSON], wrote about, the changes he is noticed and others have noticed in President [PERSON] over [DATE]. [PERSON] said that, in the second term, his will to survive is less likely to contradict his will to do good. He is going to act with more assurance, and he is going to show who he really is in his second term. Is that what you see? Well, I think one of his great strengths is his authenticity, so he is -- he is always been the same person. But I do think that, you know, it is clear, there is a huge consensus in the country about how we ought to approach the deficit, economy, issues like immigration and gun safety, and I do not think he is going to -- he is going to be very frustrated if [ORG] is completely divorced from the reality in the country. So he is going to seek common ground. He is going to find every way he can to compromise. But he is going to be pretty clear, and we are also going to bring the [NORP] people more into the debate than we did in the first term. What is the biggest difference between the President [PERSON] who took the oath [DATE] and the one who will take the oath [DATE]? Well, there is atmospheric differences. We obviously had an economy that was collapsing all around us, and he was a first-term president, so at that time, he is still putting together his team, his cabinet, his agenda. I think now the economy's still too weak but recovering, and so the question is right now is, what -- building on that, as opposed to just simply trying to stem the bleeding. So big difference. And I think the experience of the office, as you know -- you know, that helps a lot. And so I think he does have even more sure-footedness in terms of his approach and where he wants to take the country. It also can become a bit of a burden. You know, historians write about this second term curse. And I know you and your team have spent a lot of time studying how to avoid that. What is the key? Well, I think -- listen, if you look at President [PERSON]'s second term, he made significant progress on balanced budgets, [PERSON] accomplished tax reform. So second-term presidents have had success... Even if they are dealing with other problems? Yeah. And, you know, we obviously have been fortunate to be scandal-free. We want to continue that. So -- but if you -- look, it is not like we are roaming around [ORG] looking for things to do. I mean, right now, right in front of [ORG] and the country, you have got the need to reduce the deficit, continue to grow the economy, energy and climate change, immigration, gun safety. Things are stacked up. And so I think that that is going to provide the sort of focus and energy you need, and I think his -- his intention is to run through the tape all the way through. Gun safety has jumped to the top of the president's agenda since [GPE]. And [DATE], the president promised to put the weight of his office behind these proposals, but we are already seeing a lot of resistance from [NORP]. I want to show some of the reaction [DATE]. Senator [PERSON], [NORP] from [GPE]: Before passing new laws, we need a thoughtful debate that respects responsible, law-abiding gun owners in [GPE] instead of [CARDINAL]-size-fits-all directives from [GPE]. Senator [PERSON], [NORP] of [GPE]: It makes common sense to not have [CARDINAL]-size-fits-all. Senator [PERSON], [NORP] of [GPE]: I feel like it is going to be hard for any of these pieces of legislation to pass at this point. These are [NORP]. What kind of pressure is President [PERSON] going to bring to bear on them? Well, this is a tough issue, as you know, like a lot of them we are dealing this. I will say this: These are commonsense proposals that respect the rights of gun owners. Let us start there. And I think if you look at high-capacity magazines, assault weapons, universal background checks, progress we can make on mental health and school safety, all of these things enjoy enormous support of the [NORP] people, both [NORP] and [NORP]. But... So I think that putting together the legislative coalition is going to be hard, obviously, but we are very confident. I do think things have changed since Newtown. You know, Senator [PERSON], for one, other [NORP] and [NORP] are thinking anew about this issue. But Senator [PERSON], the [NORP] leader in the [ORG], and those senators I just mentioned all signaling that the assault weapons ban is likely not going to get through, and they are likely to vote against it. Will it be a success for the president if, indeed, the assault weapons ban does not pass? Well, I am not going to, you know, predict what may or may not happen legislatively. The president put forward a package. He is taken some actions on his own on things like mental health and background checks, but legislative proposals that he thinks will protect our kids, help with gun safety. We do not expect it all to pass or in its current form, but we think there is elements of this that are absolutely critical. And I think there is going to be a big spotlight shone on this. I think the [NORP] people are paying a lot of attention this debate. And he is going to twist the arms of [NORP]? Well, we are going to twist the arms of [NORP], [NORP], and we are going to engage the [NORP] people in this debate. And at the very least, we are going to have votes on all these things in the [ORG] and [ORG]. I am confident some of the measures you mentioned -- clips, universal background checks -- I think there are [CARDINAL] votes in the [ORG] and [CARDINAL] in the [ORG] that the president would sign. That could be the trade-off, [NORP] senators vote against the assault weapons ban, but vote for the magazine clips and for the universal background checks? Well, we think the assault weapons ban's very important. As you know, you were involved in passing this in [DATE], and I think that Senator [PERSON]'s looking at how to improve it and deal with some of the loopholes that were in that legislation. So we think all these things deserve votes. We think a lot of them can -- can pass. You have also bought a little more time perhaps now on the big fiscal issues, taxes and spending. The [ORG] [NORP] signaling [DATE] that they would approve a [DATE] extension of the debt limit without any spending cuts. They simply want to have a restriction on congressional pay. Now, I know the president has said that he did not want to sign any more short-term exceptions. Will he make an exception in this case? Well, we have to see what they are proposing. We have not seen what they are proposing, and they are going to have to pass it. But, no, we do not think short term is the way to go about this. But on the other hand, this is a big departure for them, you know? They were saying, the only way they were going to pay the bills they have racked up is to basically hold the... Have they caved? Yeah, I think they have, on this principle, and that is very important. So, listen, the question is, on the big fundamental issue of, can we come together on a fiscal package that reduces the deficit in the long term and then helps us grow the economy in the short term, I think the answer is yes. We are doing this in stages, as opposed to [CARDINAL] big package. So the president likely to accept this, if they do, indeed, pass it. He has said he does not want to negotiate over the debt limit, but if they pass this, there is a breathing space. So will he start negotiations right now on the big budget issues after they pass this? Yeah, and, listen, we have been pretty clear. As you know, we made public our offer to Speaker [PERSON], [MONEY] in additional spending cuts, [MONEY] in entitlement savings. This is really serious stuff, on top of the [MONEY] we have already signed into law. So the barrier to progress here is not our position of the president. We have moved more than halfway, which is a fair definition of compromise. And we are going to require some more revenues. Well, that is ... [PERSON] himself said he thought there was [MONEY] in revenue from closing loopholes. We have dealt with the tax rate issue. Now it is about loopholes. And I think the country would be well served by tax and entitlement reform, because it'll help our economy. That is what I was going to ask you, because both the [ORG] speaker [PERSON] and the [NORP] leader in the [ORG], [PERSON], have said the revenue debate is over, no more taxes. Are you saying that the president will only sign a budget deal if it includes new revenues? Yes, it is got to be balanced. And, by the way, they were not saying that [DATE]. Remember, Speaker [PERSON] said [MONEY] in revenue from closing loopholes. What is changed in [DATE]? Nothing. So there is plenty of loopholes, whether it is people shipping jobs overseas who gets preferential tax treatment, the subsidies to the energy companies, loopholes for, you know, billionaires, there are things we can close here to make our tax system fair... So you are saying no deal if they do not give on taxes? We need balance, [INTERVIEWER1]. We need -- we need spending cuts, entitlement reform, and revenue. We have to have that. Let me also talk about immigration. The president has identified immigration reform as another top priority of his second term. You just mentioned it again. The [NORP] senator, [PERSON], has been taking the lead [DATE]. And [PERSON], the [ORG] press secretary, had some positive words about his proposals [DATE]. But [PERSON] said [DATE] -- and he was on [PERSON] show -- that the president has not reached out to him. Take a look. Why not? Well, there is going to be a debate and process over immigration reform. And I think during that process, I think there will be discussions that we, the president, the administration has with members of [ORG] and [ORG] among themselves. But what is clear is, this -- the stars are aligned for immigration reform. By the way, it needs to be real immigration reform, not symbolic. But are not you going to have to team up with [PERSON] to get it done? Well, my point -- [INTERVIEWER1], there is going to be a process. And I do think that there is broad [NORP] support around the country, not as much in [ORG], but maybe we are beginning to see a change there. The stars are aligned for progress here on, you know, building on the border security progress we have made, holding businesses accountable, in terms of hiring legal immigrants, in terms of a pathway to earned citizenship. So I do think the moment is here right now to finally get this done, high-skilled workers for our businesses. There is a lot that we can do. But those are all things that he is talking about, as well. Would not it be a more powerful position if the president and a key [NORP] like that had a united front? Well, [INTERVIEWER1], this process will begin shortly, another effort here to finally get immigration reform. And at that point, I think you are going to see us working with [NORP] and [NORP], people outside of [GPE], there is a huge consensus in the business community, in the faith community for immigration reform. So, yeah, our hope is that we can do this. Maybe this is an issue that does not have to be as hard as it should -- as it needs to be. It should be something where there seems to be a consensus in the country. I think there is a political necessity for [ORG] to do this. And we believe it is the right thing to do for our country and our economy. I know you want to put the weight of the president's campaign behind all these issues. The president set up a new organization, [ORG], a new political action committee, unlimited donations from corporations, but the president will disclose all donors? Yes, we will voluntarily disclose all of our donors. And we are very excited. The people who actually made the president's campaign in both [DATE] and [DATE], our great grassroots volunteers, were pretty clear after the election they wanted to stay with it and they want to be out there organizing, driving message, holding people accountable on issues like immigration, you know, the deficit and jobs, gun safety, a lot of passion out there. And so I think one of the lessons from the first term that we want to do better is, yes, there has to be an inside game. There also has to be an outside game. It is not either/or. And you put those things together, because it -- as you know, times that you really get fundamental progress and change in [GPE] is where the [NORP] people are really focused and pushing, and we want to make sure that we are in communication with them. I know you will be advising [ORG], but this is [DATE] at [FAC]. What do you miss most? Well, it is just a privilege, as you know, to work in that building. And you get a PhD in a short matter of time on every issue facing the country. And it is just an awesome honor to spend a little time there. And I think for me personally this has been a remarkable journey. [DATE], we were the longest of long shots running for president. Now [DATE] he will be giving a second inaugural address. And so I will miss -- you know, this is a great moment where those of us who always wanted to work in a campaign like this, with grassroots energy, for a candidate like this, with amazing colleagues. So it is been a remarkable journey. But what I will miss most is just, you know, the president each and every day, you know, the integrity he brings to decision-making, the focus he has, the vision he has, and that is why this second term -- I will tell you, you know, in [DATE], you know, he is made it clear, there is going to be no let-up. He is going to push as hard as he can in a second term to continue to move the country forward, building this progress, and I think that -- as I said, the issues are stacked up. And now we have just got to go get them done. So you are going to work hard, but savor that moment [DATE]? Absolutely. Really soak it in. [INTERVIEWED1], thank you so much. Take care.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "revcomblogtranscriptsmichigangovgretchenwhitmercovid19briefingtranscriptapril2ordersk12schoolscloseforrestofyear", "text": "Thank you, [INTERVIEWED2]. I'd be happy to open it up for some questions from the press. Can you speak to how this [inaudible [TIME]] order will be enforced. Will [ORG] be called in at all? Or how will it be enforced here in [GPE]? So, a couple of points. First and foremost, this is not a recommendation, this is an order. And we take it very seriously. This is about the public health of our people. We have ensured that essential services are still available, that if someone needs to go out and get food, that they can do that. And that- If someone needs to go out and get food that they can do that and the food supply chain is robust and prepared to meet the needs of people across the state. We have also ensured that if you need to do banking or gas up your car, you can do some of those fundamental things that are necessary for life. Go and get your prescription. But for any businesses that do not heed this order and they are not essential services, I would anticipate that there will be fines associated with not doing that and they will be shut. We have a moment to stem the crisis that we see unfolding before us and it is going to take all of us to take those actions seriously. And that is precisely why this order's so important right now. With regard to questions about [ORG], they are helping with humanitarian efforts, not on any sort of a law enforcement front because we have got to ensure that food gets where it needs to be, that we are setting up temporary hospitals, temporary hospital beds, medical abilities to meet the need. And so they are helping in states across the nation. And it is in that capacity. But there will not be any checkpoints or anything like that on the roadways on the highways, that kind of thing? No. At this point in time, what we are asking is that people recognize this is an order that they must comply for their own health, for the safety of others and for the longterm health of our economy. Any businesses that do not comply, there will be ramifications for it to be sure. We have confidence that when [NORP] understand how serious this is, if you really have been paying attention or if you are now suddenly starting to pay attention, you know that we all have to do our part and for some of us it'll look simply Doing your part will just look like staying at home. For others and we will be staying at home and going online and making a donation to the food bank. For others perhaps they can call [ORG] and see if there is something they can do, checking in on elderly friends and neighbors over the phone or FaceTime. There are ways of coping with this. I am not suggesting it will be easy, but if we all do our part and that means business owners too, do not play fast and loose with what is essential and what is not. Do not try to skirt the rules. If you are not an essential business, you need to close and you need to protect your employees. We are confident that the vast majority of people are going to do the right thing. We are imploring those who are maybe still uneducated in how serious this is, that perhaps now they will understand because this is an order. And this is going to be something that everyone's got to be a part of following. What about restaurants and carry out delivery services, things like that? Are those still okay? Restaurants, the carry out, dine out option is still something that is available to people. This is an essential service, which is the feeding of the people of our states. Grocery stores, convenience stores, the pharmacy, the restaurant where you can get your takeout, those will all still continue to serve the public. But we ask the public to, where you can make use of a delivery service, do that, where you do not have to physically be the one to go out and get it. And there are others who are doing that, make use of it if it is available to you. Governor, what [inaudible [TIME]] is there for people to use to decide whether or not they are covered by this order? I think that as you read the order, and I know you have not had a chance to scrutinize all the language in the order, but I think it is pretty clear about what services are considered essential and whether or not you fall into those parameters are not. I do think that the business community has had an opportunity to give some input over the course of our research and development of this order. And I think that we have made it pretty clear in the terms of the order. This question is for both of you. You have mentioned in your statement, [INTERVIEWED2], about thinking of the healthcare workers that are trying to battle this and there seems to be some inconsistency with the guidelines for those healthcare workers between state recommendations and the [ORG] recommendations as to whether they exposed to a potential case, maybe have been asked by the state to keep working but not to quarantine. My question is, is this the safest move for those workers, but also for patients and families tied to them? I will have to ask [INTERVIEWED2] to weigh in on that one. We have used, for all of our guidance in the state, we have to look first to the [ORG] guidelines and we consult with them when we implement our own guidelines. We have to make very difficult choices and make sure that, especially healthcare workers who are symptomatic, are not at work period and that they get the appropriate test if it is warranted and if they test positive that they stay at home. We are actually in alignment with [ORG] guidelines and we just had to get a little more granular because our clinicians were asking for that guidance. [inaudible 00:23:14] cut production at their plants. Are they subject to this as well and how do you account for the ones who are trying to make essential equipment, PPE stuff? Yeah. If you are making essential equipment, you are covered in this order in terms of an essential activity that will continue on. Yes, they are covered by this order. If they are retrofitting to meet critical needs of our nation right now and then the health of our people, then that is an essential service that absolutely would be contemplated and encouraged and permitted under this order. What are the companies associated with the business whose perhaps violating Yeah. I mean, [PERSON], the fines, we will have to give you some more information on exactly what that looks like. I can tell you that the Director of [ORG] is the primary when it comes to assessing and writing those. So I think we will have to give you a little more information when we have [TIME]. Governor, you touched on this, but what changed or occurred or did not occur to make you ramp up the earlier basically advice as opposed to and order with consequences? Well, a couple of things. First of all, exponential growth. We know that we are not capable of testing everyone who needs to be tested because we do not have enough tests from the federal government. Despite that, we have seen exponential growth in the number of presumptively positives. We know the trajectory that we are on and I have talked to [INTERVIEWED2] and experts across the country and it became very clear that our healthcare system is quickly going to get overwhelmed and without the support of the PPEs and all of the other essential pieces of protection that we need and the resources and the bandwidth for our hospitals. We have to be aggressive in curtailing the community spread. And it is by people and keep away from each other. What we know is that there still are gatherings happening that there still are people that are out and about conducting their lives as though we are not living in the midst of a global epidemic. We do not have beaches that are open right now, but we all saw the footage and I cannot for the life of me figure out why anyone would want to congregate in this era. But the fact of the matter is, we still have people that are doing it and that is why we have got to be really clear about the seriousness of this and put the full weight of an executive order behind it. These are all different pieces of it, but I will tell you the current trajectory we are on, looks a lot like [GPE]. And if you have seen any of the coverage about what is happening in [GPE], what it means for their economy, but most importantly, what it means for the lives of the [NORP] people, you know that we have got to do everything in our power to keep that from happening here in [GPE]. And I shared with you [CARDINAL] anecdote about younger people being as susceptible as older people. There is been this misperception that if you are young you are not susceptible to COVID [CARDINAL]. The fact of the matter is, in [GPE], we are seeing severe consequences in our younger people, in ways that they have not seen in other parts of the world. And I have talked to [CARDINAL] physician who has observed and perhaps there is too little science to know precisely if this is what is going on, but vaping is a lot more popular in [GPE] than it is elsewhere. And that compromises your respiratory system and makes you more susceptible to respiratory illness. And so this is a crisis The respiratory illness and so this is a crisis that we are feeling in ways that other parts of the world has not even experienced. Regarding elections, this order goes into [DATE], but we are wondering if [DATE] elections may be impacted by this, if you think they should be postponed? So we are working with the secretary of [ORG] as well as the legislative leaders to assess if there are ways that we can improve the ability for people to cast their votes at home. That is a conversation that is been started. I would anticipate that it will take on additional energy [DATE]. We may have something to share with you later. We want to make sure people are able to vote and to vote safely. Are temporary hospital structures going up? Are you looking at dorms, things like that to deal with this? And a question on ventilators, I think over [DATE], you said that there were [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] across the state. I am wondering how those are being used and what kind of shortage we are facing at the moment? We have teams that are actively looking at just this question of where are we going to need this hospital capacity. Not just in some of the areas where we are seeing the most cases, but we have to come together as a state, understand where our hospital beds are, and where we may have more need. So that plan is being developed as we speak. As far as the ventilators, we do need to get a stronger handle on more real time what the situation is on the ground in these intensive care units. But I can tell you at least from anecdotal conversations across the state, we are getting very, very sick people and our intensive care units are getting filled up. Do you have any figures as to how many people are hospitalized with this now? Is that a number that you are tracking? [inaudible [TIME]] at some point. We are actively trying to track that. Here in the state of [GPE], we have a decentralized public health system, so a lot the local health departments actually are able to track that in more real time than we can at the state. But we are actively working to strengthen and centralize data sharing from the hospitals to local health departments and to the state of [GPE] health department. But we do not know what that number is or is close to right now? I do not have the specific number right now. [inaudible [TIME]]? There are [CARDINAL] of people who are [CARDINAL] of people who are in intensive care units as we speak. I do not want to misspeak and give you a wrong number, but I know that there are several individuals, [CARDINAL] who are hospitalized at this point Over [DATE], a federal task force was giving briefings and letting you guys know where they stand on things and what their responsibilities are versus state. So I am wondering what your response is to some of those comments that were made over [DATE] about the responsibilities that state's have to find those resources such as the ventilators and PPE versus the federal government's responsibility. Well, we can litigate what contributed to us all being behind the [CARDINAL] ball in [GPE] right now. After we get past the initial crisis that we are confronting, I will just say this, our national stockpile allotment covered [CARDINAL] shift at a hospital. So where you would ordinarily in a crisis like this, expect a national strategy that covers all of the states and all [NORP] and makes available the necessary equipment to treat people who are sick, we got enough for [CARDINAL] shift. It is a source of frustration that I have been clear about and that my frankly colleagues from across the country have as well. We should be able to rely on a national strategy and planning. This is not something that was not known at the federal government level [DATE]. But re-litigating that and spending energy on it right now does not solve the problem and that is what I am going to stay focused on and that is why my team and the state emergency operation center is working so hard with [GPE] businesses, with businesses outside of [GPE] to procure the masks and the face shields and the gowns and all of the different pieces of equipment that are necessary so that we can treat people. That is why the healthcare situation is so dire and that is why taking an aggressive action like stay at home so crucial to our ability to meet the needs of our people and so we are going to continue doing that as people who are listening, who are paying attention, have been reaching in. We are grateful for that. We have been able to do a lot because people have offered to help and where there is additional opportunities like that we are going to avail ourselves of it because at this point in time, I think the governor from [GPE] said it, it is governor versus governor trying to get as much as they can for our states. It should not have to be that way. If the federal government had done some planning on the front end, we would be in a lot better shape. But here we are and we have all got a job to do for the people that we serve. I will just conclude with this, tough times do not last but tough people do. [GPE] and this country has been in crises before and we have called on our country men and country women to step up to the challenge to meet the need. And [GPE] played a huge part in winning World War Two as the arsenal of democracy. Right now we are calling on everyone to do your part. We need to get through this crisis together and we need everyone to do their part. So we are asking, stay home, stay safe, save lives. That is the most important thing that we can all do right now. Observe these orders, take care of yourself, and stay home.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "presidencyucsbedudocumentsinterviewwitherinburnettcnn", "text": "And now, [NORP] presidential candidate [INTERVIEWER1] is here with me in [GPE]. Thank you so much, [INTERVIEWER1]. I appreciate your being with me. Great to be with you. This is a crucial state. You just heard [PERSON] say your campaigns are talking to each other about another debate. You have asked for one. Of course, as you are aware, [DATE], a [PERSON] campaign spokesman said your requests for debates are a quote/unquote, publicity stunt. Do you think she is serious about debating you? I certainly hope so. Look, there are huge issues facing this country. Our middle class disappearing. Grotesque levels of income and wealth inequality. A campaign finance system that is corrupt and a broken criminal justice system. And in [GPE], there are additional problems. So I would hope that we would have a good debate. My understanding is she would like to do it in [GPE]. I was born in [GPE]. Let us do it! Game on for [GPE]. Game on. The other big news, of course, you heard at the top of the program, you saw the video [DATE] from a [PERSON] rally. But of course, [PERSON] campaign manager charged with simple battery for an altercation with a reporter recently. [TIME], he just defended that campaign manager. He said, I know it would be easy for to discard people. I do not discard people. Should [PERSON] fire [PERSON]? Well, let us see what happens in the legal process. He is been charged, and we do not find people guilty until you go through a process. But my campaign manager does not assault female journalists, let me just say that. You know, [PERSON] came out and said he would if this had happened to him. He would go ahead and fire his campaign manager. If the roles were reversed, were you? Well, let me just say this. Let me just say this. What has concerned me very much about [PERSON] is the edginess of calls to violence around his campaigns. What I found absolutely shocking, not only this campaign manager's action. But he was prepared - or at least indicated that he was prepared -- to pay the legal fees for somebody who quite openly sucker-punched somebody - right, knocked them down. And when you say you are going to pay the legal fees for someone who commits a gross act of violence, what you are really telling your supporters is that violence is okay. But [INTERVIEWER1], to me, all of that stuff is interesting political stuff. But what we are trying to focus on in this campaign are the issues that impact the [NORP] people. Which, frankly, is why I think our campaign is doing so well. [CARDINAL] of the key issues that we are dealing with is a rigged economy in which [CARDINAL] of people [DATE] are working longer hours for lower wages. A broken trade system right here in [GPE]. [CARDINAL] of jobs have been lost because companies shut down here, moved to [GPE], moved to [GPE]. We need a trade policy that works for workers, not just the CEOs of large corporations. Now, you are obviously making this case here in [GPE]. You have the landslide wins on [DATE], right, in [CARDINAL] crucial states. Yeah. Now you are here in [GPE]. It is huge, right? You have got [CARDINAL] delegates -- Absolutely. -- [CARDINAL] if you count the ones up for grabs. Are you going to win [GPE]? Are you confident? I am never into speculation. I will tell you that [TIME] of the election, all right? I will tell you exactly what the results are. But it is silly to be talking about it. All I can say is we are going to work very, very hard. We have a lot of volunteers here in the state. We are going to be knocking on doors, we are going to be making phone calls. And our message about the need to create an economy that works for all people is in fact resonating here in [GPE]. And I think you are going to see us do very well. So, one of the arguments you are making on that front, right, is free college. No, no, no - -- free public university - You see, every time I am on a show, somebody says free college. It is free tuition at public colleges and universities. OK, so on that front, though -- because it is important how you word it, your plan -- we have a federalist system. You would be chipping in money to the states, and they would then have the decision to make. Yes. [PERSON] says that is just not going to happen in a state like [GPE]. Yes. Let me just play what she said, basically about you [TIME]. Here she is. [begin video clip] [end video clip] I mean, [PERSON] turned down [MONEY] in [ORG]. OK, let me just say the danger - let me just say this. Number [CARDINAL], in [DATE], we have got to recognize that a college degree is pretty much the equivalent of what a high school degree was [DATE]. The world has changed. The economy has changed. We need to have the best educated work force in the world. Young people should not be denied the opportunity because they do not have the money. Or they should not have to leave school $[MONEY], 000, $[MONEY], 000 in debt. So we do believe, I do believe very strongly in making public colleges and universities tuition-tree. Now, what Secretary [PERSON] said is that [PERSON] may not go along with that. Well, you know what happens to the state of [GPE] if he does not? [GPE] will, [GPE] will, states all over this country will, and young, bright people will be leaving [GPE]. And I think the people of [GPE] will tell [PERSON], you know what? This will be a disaster for the future of our state. Because when kids leave, sometimes they do not come back. So I think the idea is sound. It is paid for, [INTERVIEWER1], by a tax on Wall Street's speculation. When Wall Street's illegal behavior destroyed our economy, middle class bailed them out. It is now time for them to help the middle class. What about, though, the issue on terms of the pure pay force, right? During the midst of the financial crisis when people said, let [ORG] go under. Let them go under. They do not deserve to survive, you know? You are not just talking about [CARDINAL] of people that would have worked for that bank, but also the [CARDINAL] of [NORP] that have -- own shares of that bank and their 401, their IRA. [inaudible] [CARDINAL] of [NORP] own stocks now. Middle class [NORP] who could end up paying for them. No, no, the vast majority of that speculation tax will be paid by upper-income people. And that is the way we have designed it. But at the end of the day, look, this campaign is not your typical campaign. It is not your [PERSON] campaign. We are thinking bigger and bolder. Now, you tell me, if [GPE] can provide in fact free college education, Scandinavia can do it, other countries around the world can do it, why cannot we do it? Why cannot we have the best educated work force in the world, which we are going to need if our economy is to survive? And let me also add this. In [DATE], there has been a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top [PERCENT]. I know you do not talk about it too much in the media, but that is the fact. We are talking about [MONEY]. So yes, I am running for president, and am telling the top one-tenth of one percent they are going to have to pay more in taxes. And just a question, let me take a step back about the whole idea. You say you want the best educated work force. When you look at the top-ranked countries, you are looking at places like [GPE], like [GPE], like [GPE]. All of them require people to pay in most instances about what people pay here for public education. Listen, trust me. People are going to be paying for [ORG] and [ORG] and all kinds of private schools. The way I see it, [INTERVIEWER1], is that right now, and for [DATE], we have had public education which says that no matter what your income is, right? You are rich or poor, you can go from the first grade to the 12th grade for free. We take it for granted. All I am saying is that in [DATE], with a radically changing economy, where young people need more education, let us extend that concept beyond the 12th grade through public colleges and universities. All right. [INTERVIEWER1] [PERSON] is staying with me. We are going to have much more in our exclusive conversation in [TIME] in the wake of the terror attacks in [GPE]. We are going to talk about that and the fight against [ORG]. And we are also going to be counting down, of course, to the town hall for the [ORG]. [PERSON], [PERSON], [PERSON], [TIME] from now right across town here in [GPE] Welcome back. We are live [TIME] in [GPE], [GPE] where in [TIME], the [CARDINAL] remaining [NORP] presidential candidates will be going before voters at our town hall across town here and make their case. And of course, right now, I am talking exclusively to [INTERVIEWER1], who is also come campaigning here in this must-win state up against [PERSON]. [INTERVIEWER1], let us continue our conversation. The open primary here in [GPE] is important. That means people can switch over. They can vote for whomever they would like, [NORP], [NORP]. We have seen this across the country, people choosing between you and and [PERSON]. Some union workers, we understand here, are deeply considering whether they should vote for you or [PERSON]. Do you think they are crazy? What do you say to people who are making that choice? Well, I think we will get the vast majority of the union workers. [PERSON] will get some, but I think we will get a lot more. I think what is going on, [INTERVIEWER1], is there is a lot of anger in this country. For your average guy, he is asking why he has to work longer [TIME] for lower wages. Why he is really worried or she is worried, mother really about the future of their children. And yet, almost all income and wealth is going to [PERCENT] 1 percent. People are angry. What [PERSON] is doing is taking that anger and saying, it is the fault of the [NORP] or it is the fault of the [NORP]. We have got to scapegoat people. Well, beating up on [NORP] who make [MONEY] an hour is not going to deal with the real issues facing -- Are you, though, blaming rich people for it? It is not rich people, no. We are blaming a economic system right now where factually almost all the income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. Where you have billionaires and large corporations that are not paying their fair share of taxes; there are some major corporations make [CARDINAL] a year in taxes, stash their money in [GPE], do not pay a nickel in taxes. And what I want to do is take that money, do away with that loophole, invest it in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. We can create [CARDINAL] jobs over a [DATE] period with a [MONEY] investment. That is roads, bridges, water systems, waste water plants. It is not a question of blaming, it is a question of understanding the reality. It is a rigged economy. People on the top are doing phenomenally well; everybody else is doing worse. We have got to change that. [PERSON] is a supporter of yours, as you know. The actress, she said, Some people feel [PERSON] will bring the revolution immediately if he gets in. Is [PERSON] more likely to bring about a revolution in this country -- and you have been having revolutionary talk. I know not of the violent sort, but in terms of making changes in this country. Is he more likely to accomplish that -- Well, I am not sure -- I heard that. I did not really see here [PERSON]'s context -- [PERSON]'s comment within a broader context. I think [PERSON] will be a disaster for this country. I think the idea of insulting women and veterans and [NORP] and [NORP] and [NORP] is precisely what this country does not need and does not want. Look, in every poll that I have seen, including a [ORG] poll, we were [CARDINAL] points ahead of [PERSON]. I do not believe [PERSON] is going to become president of [GPE]. You do win in those head-to-heads, of course, in the polling. We spoke to some female [PERSON] supporters [DATE] in [GPE]. It was a fascinating conversation about why they do believe in [PERSON], why they support him. Here is what [CARDINAL] of them had to say. I do. Well, it is not only -- no, I do not understand his appeal to women. I do not think he is particularly popular with women in general. You cannot go around insulting women [DATE] and expect to gain support. But I understand where that woman is coming from. Look, people are sick and tired of establishment politicians. Politicians say [CARDINAL] thing, they do another thing. You know, the [ORG] has a favorability rating of [PERCENT] or something. And [PERSON] is, of course, very blunt and straightforward. But you have got to look at what he is saying. Does that woman really believe the billionaire class should receive [MONEY] in tax breaks over a [DATE] period? I doubt it. Does she not think that we should raise the minimum wage? [PERSON] does not. Does she really think we should insult [NORP] all over the world? I do not think she does think that. So, I think the appeal of [PERSON] is his bluntness, is his straightforwardness. And by the way, this guy is a good entertainer. He has done a very good job manipulating the media. He is a professional at that. And he has been successful doing it. So, let me talk about [NORP] and the issues that he has brought up on that. I was in [GPE] [DATE]. I spoke to a young man, and it was [CARDINAL] people who have gone to [GPE] to fight with [ORG]. I spoke to the brother of the [GPE] attacker - of [CARDINAL] of the [GPE] attackers [DATE] in [GPE]. He told me he knows many young men who are in [GPE] training to fight with [ORG]. And they are coming back now. And yet, you can still, without a visa, get on a plane in [GPE] and fly to [GPE]. How do you prevent these young men who say their ultimate goal is to attack [GPE] from coming here without racially profiling, as [PERSON] suggested? You do everything that you can. And that means you have information, and we have -- that is what intelligence services are all over the world. And you share that information. And if people are going to [GPE], if they are going to training camps, they are not going to come -- or if they come back into [GPE] or they come into [GPE], they are going to be arrested in [TIME]. We have [CARDINAL] tolerance for people who are going to hurt [NORP] or people anyplace else in the world. But intelligence services have not been coordinating. When people -- I know people in [GPE] who said my son - [CARDINAL] of - the bomber here, they said, my son is in [GPE]. And authorities did not care. So if they do not know the names who is there, they do not know who is coming back. But [PERSON] , look. No one is saying -- first of all, let us look at the broader issue. Number [CARDINAL] in [GPE] right now, [ORG] on the defensive. They have lost [PERCENT] of the territory they controlled. And I believe that if we are smart, if we do a good job in training the [NORP] army, and the [NORP] nations, they can be destroyed in [DATE] or [CARDINAL]. That certainly is the goal. And second of all, we have got to do everything that with can. No one has any magical solutions. But we do have to improve our intelligence capabilities. We do have to make sure that federal, state and local law enforcement is much better coordinated in preventing these types of attacks. Before we go, federal officials, as you know, [DATE] say they have unlocked the iPhone of [CARDINAL] of the shooters in [GPE]. Now, they had been suing [ORG] to force [ORG] to do just that. They figured out how to do it themselves. I know you have said you are fearful of Big Brother in [GPE]. But this is a terrorist's phone. Is it a good thing the [ORG] broke into it? Look, I think that clearly, we need to get all of the information that we can to stop terrorism. But at the same time, we have to be mindful that in a free society, you do not want the government, I suspect, into your telephone. Would I be correct in saying that? Mm-hmm. So, what the correct balance is what we have to determine. But I am concerned about civil liberties -- Even protecting someone's phone that massacred [NORP]? No, not protecting -- that is the balance. Of course, you are going to go after people who are killing [NORP]. That goes without saying. But it is [CARDINAL] thing to go after a terrorist; it is another thing to have [CARDINAL] of people being -- having their e-mails or their websites surveyed when the vast majority of them have nothing to do with terrorism. So how you balance in a free society, the civil liberties and the constitutional rights of our people, while on the other hand, going after terrorists. That is the balance that we have got to establish. All right. Well, [INTERVIEWER1], thank you very much for your time. Nice talking to you [TIME]. Nice to see you.", "discourse_type": 1}
{"id": "abcnewsgocomPoliticsweektranscriptreppaulryanwhitehousechiefstoryid18515489", "text": "Hello again, [PERSON] is off [DATE], it is great to have you with us. In a [ORG] exclusive, [INTERVIEWED2] is standing by to join us live, but first, a major political story breaking [TIME]. A new report from [ORG] with what the paper says is a draft of the [ORG] immigration proposal. According to the report, the plan includes allowing undocumented immigrants to apply for legal status with a pathway to citizenship after [DATE]. It also expands e-verify and border security. Joining us now to talk about this is the new [ORG] Chief of Staff [INTERVIEWED1]. Thank you for joining us. Thanks for having me, [PERSON]. Now, this hit with a thud as far as [PERSON] is concerned. He said [TIME] in a statement, quote, this legislation is half baked and seriously flawed. It would actually make our immigration problems worse. If actually proposed, the president's bill would be dead on arrival in [ORG], leaving us with unsecured borders and a broken legal immigration system for [DATE] to come. Let us be honest. There is no passing an immigration bill without [PERSON]. How could [ORG] be working on a draft without [NORP] input? [PERSON], you know, the president has always approached this question of immigration reform from [CARDINAL] principles. [CARDINAL], let us make sure that the border is secure. [CARDINAL], let us make sure that we enforce on businesses who are gaming the system, enforce their requirements to live up to the law. [CARDINAL], make sure that we are reforming legal immigration so that we can use it to make sure that those who have come here legally have a reasonable option. And we have not proposed anything to [ORG] yet. We have got a bill, we are doing exactly what the president said we would do [DATE] in [GPE], which is we are preparing. We are going to be ready. We have developed each of these proposals so we have them in a position so that we can succeed, because fact of the matter is, [PERSON], as you know as well as I do, going back to [DATE], this has been a priority for many [NORP]. So let us make sure that they get this thing done. And they are up there working on it right now. Senator [PERSON], Senator [PERSON], Senator [PERSON] and others. And let us see how they do, and we will be ready to work with them. But back to my question here, how could [ORG] be working on a draft -- even if it is a [ORG] draft -- without at least talking to [NORP] about it? I mean, has the president even met with [PERSON] yet on immigration? Well, we are talking with all the parties to the gang of [CARDINAL] effort in the [ORG]. [PERSON] -- He says there is been no consultation. We have been working with all the members up there. We have our staff working this very aggressively with their staffs and with the members, and we are working this very aggressively, as you think we would with such a high priority for the country. This immigration system is broken. Border security, we have made great progress for [DATE]. We want to build on that. And we are going to continue to work with Senator [PERSON] and others on this. But he says it is dead on arrival if it is proposed. Well, let us make sure that it does not have to be proposed. Let us make sure that that group up there, [ORG], makes good progress on these efforts, as much as they say they want to, and that is exactly what we intend to do, to work with them. So what do you say to [PERSON] on this? I mean, he is saying half-baked, flawed. What do you say to him? How do you do some damage control on this? Well, I am not going to get engaged in that kind of a back and forth as is often the practice here in [GPE], a big kind of political scrum, even before we have had actual proposal of-- It is already here. He started it. Right, I mean-- Well, look, I am not going to engage, as I said, in some kind of back and forth. What I am going to do is make sure that our team is doing exactly what the president has demanded us to do, and what he said to the country in the State of the Union [TIME], which is we have to make progress on immigration reform. We should enact [DATE], and the president will continue to work with the team to make sure that happens. OK, I want to move to the other big battle you have coming up right now with [ORG]. The so-called sequester, these automatic spending cuts. We have heard some dire warnings about what they would mean. We have heard [CARDINAL] 000 kids kicked off Head Start, the equivalent of [CARDINAL][CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [ORG] agents off the job, the [ORG] shutting down [CARDINAL] air wings, delaying the deployment of a carrier striker to the Persian Gulf, and we have even had a senator talk about [TIME] wait times at airports if these cuts go into effect. So tell me straight with me, how bad will it be if it happens? Well, you did not even raise the thing that concerns the president most about the sequester, which is we have seen pretty good economic activity over the course of [DATE]. The housing market is healing. The stock market is coming back. You have seen consumer confidence restored. So the lens through which the president looks at this fight, [PERSON], is a lens that says, are we doing everything we can in this country to strengthen middle class families? That is how our country, our economy is strongest, when a thriving, rising middle class is the engine for growth in this economy. That is exactly what we want to do. When you look at sequester, the impacts on middle class families, what is it going to be? Teachers in schools, [CARDINAL] 000 schools are going to be-- [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] teachers are going to be hit, [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] schools. If you look at mental health, if you look at food inspections -- and you have already heard the devastating list of horribles that the [ORG] has said are going to be out there. So the question is, on top of all those things that you just talked about is what is the impact on the middle class? So the question the president is asking is why do not we take a step back, let us fix this in a kind of balanced way the president has proposed and the [ORG] [NORP] have proposed, with a reasonable amount of spending cuts and a reasonable amount of revenue raisers so that we can get this thing done and move on to the business of the country. But help me understand, because we have a budget. This is -- let us look at exactly what this is. [MONEY] [DATE] out of a budget of [MONEY]. You can see just the small slice, and then if you look at the sequester over [DATE], we are talking about [CARDINAL] out of [MONEY] in projected government spending. Is it really impossible to find [PERCENT] 3 percent of savings in a federal budget without making those kind of horrible cuts? You know what, it is not impossible, and that is exactly what the president has done over [DATE], [MONEY] in deficit reduction. He is ready to do [MONEY] to get up to the [MONEY] target that economists across the country tell us is needed to stabilize the debt over [DATE]. So that is exactly what the president has done, working with [NORP] and [NORP]. But you are going to insist on tax increases, right? Well, we are going to insist on doing this in a balanced way-- Which means tax increases. A way that -- we are going to insist on doing this in a balanced way. A way that allows us to maintain the kinds of investments that middle-class families in this country rely on, [PERSON]. We were just talking about our families, our kids. You know what, we are not going to put at risk the education investments in this country because we cannot get together to resolve this in a balanced way. This is not an ideological effort, [PERSON]. This should not be a social science experiment. This should be a question where we ask ourselves, what is most important to the economy, what is most important to the middle class families of this country, and that is the way the president is going to do this. OK, we are almost out of time. Very quickly, [CARDINAL] other things. Yes. [PERSON], the nomination delayed, also [ORG] director, your nominee, [PERSON], looks like he will be delayed. Is this a threat to national security? It is a grave concern. If you look at [PERSON], decorated war veteran himself, war hero. [NORP] senator. Somebody who over the course of [DATE], either as a [NORP] senator or as the chairman of the president's [ORG], I have worked with very closely. This guy has [CARDINAL] thing in mind, how do we protect the country. Is there a danger of this being delayed? Between [PERSON], [ORG] director, and [PERSON] as second of defense, we want to make sure that we have our -- those guys sitting in the chairs working, because I do not want there to have been something missed because of this hangup here in [GPE]. OK, and very quickly, [PERSON] had a very -- seemed like a harsh comment directed toward the president, saying that quote, I do not think he has the guts to cut or to deal with the entitlement problem. He do not have the courage to take on the liberal side of his own party. What do you say to the speaker of the [ORG], [PERSON]? In the State of the Union address on [DATE] [TIME], the president laid out a very detailed plan to get to the [MONEY] in deficit reduction that we need to stabilize debt, grow the economy, strengthen the middle class. That is exactly what he is done. That takes on his party, and asks the [NORP] to do a little bit too. And that is what we are going to continue to do. All right. [INTERVIEWED1], brand-new [ORG] chief of staff. Thank you for coming here on This Week. Thanks so much for having me, [PERSON]. And now, in a This Week exclusive, [INTERVIEWED2] joins us from [GPE], [GPE]. [INTERVIEWED2], thanks for coming to the show. Hey, good [TIME], [PERSON]. I want to get right to this dustup over immigration and [PERSON] comments. [DATE], you said that the president deserved credit for not politicizing the immigration issue. You thought that was a good sign. Do you still believe that? Actually, I do not , and I really do not enjoy saying this. I did think that his words were measured and productive in the State of the Union. But putting this -- leaking this out does set things in the wrong direction. Look, the question that we always have to ask ourselves, particularly with [ORG], is the president looking for a partisan advantage or is he looking for a bipartisan law? And by putting these details out without a guest worker program, without addressing future flow, by giving advantage to those who cut in front of line for immigrants who came here legally, not dealing with border security adequately, that tells us that he is looking for a partisan advantage and not a bipartisan solution. There are groups in the [ORG] and the [ORG] working together to get this done and when he does things like this, it makes that much more difficult to do that. And that is why I think this particular move, very counterproductive. Well, let us be clear. You have said that you would support an immigration bill that included a pathway for citizenship, correct? Yes, look, absolutely because we think that is -- there is a way to do this through earned legalization without rewarding people for having come in with undocumented status, illegally. We do not want to give them an advantage over those who came here legally and we think there is a way to do this while still respecting the rule of law. It is clear that what the president is talking about does not do that. I have a long record of immigration reform. I am not a Johnny-come-lately on this issue. We have always believed that there is a way of doing this while respecting the rule of law, that is the delicate balance that needs to be achieved for this to be bipartisan and the president on most of these issues and this one now, like the others, seems to be looking for a partisan advantage and not bringing the parties together. Well, let us get to the biggest other issue out there right now which is these automatic spending cuts. You have been pretty clear. You have predicted for some time that you think that this so-called sequester is going to happen. Let me ask you this, [ORG] is now on recess for [DATE], the president is playing golf in [GPE] [DATE]. Is there really any [DATE] underway to try to avert these cuts right now? Are you even trying. Well, there have been from the [ORG] [NORP]. Let us take a step back. Do not forget it is the president that proposed the sequester and designed sequester and [ORG] [NORP] who twice passed legislation replacing the sequester with smarter cuts in other areas of government. OK. The [ORG] has not passed a bill to replace the sequester. The president gave a speech showing that he'd like to replace it, but he has not put any details out there. So that is why I conclude I believe it is going to take place. But take a step back. We are here because the president back in the last session of congress refused to cut spending in any place and therefore we wound up with the sequester. But [INTERVIEWED1], I have heard you say this and a talking point for [NORP] for a long time. This was the president's idea on and on and on, but let us look at your own words. What you said right after the law putting this in place was passed in [DATE]. These are your words. You said what conservatives like me have been fighting for, for [DATE] are statutory caps on spending, literally legal caps in law that says government agencies cannot spend over a set amount of money and if they breach that amount across the board sequester comes in to cut that spending. You cannot turn it out without a supermajority. We got that into law. Now it sounds to me there like if you were not taking credit for the idea of the sequester, you were certainly suggesting it was a good idea. So those are the budget caps on discretionary spending. Those occurred. We want those. Everybody wants budget caps. The sequester we are talking about now was backing up the super committee. Remember [ORG] in addition to those caps was supposed to come up with [MONEY] in savings. The [NORP] on the super committee offered even higher revenues in exchange for spending cuts as part of that. It was rejected by the president and the [NORP]. So no resolution occurred and therefore the sequester is occurring. And what we have always said is let us cut spending in smarter ways to replace this sequester. We passed [CARDINAL] bills doing that and we have heard nothing in response from the [ORG] [NORP] or the president. Now... We did not pass anything. And the point I am trying to say is, when you have no budget passing the [ORG] for [DATE], when the president is going to be [DATE] late in proposing his budget, there is no leadership on the other side of the aisle and therefore no agreement. Now, wait [TIME]. [CARDINAL] points, first of all, actually [ORG] [NORP] have not acted in this congress. You know, you did in the last congress those bills are dead. No, in this congress... So why have not you even tried to pass... In [DATE] we passed it again, that is right. OK. So now we have... Please say that again. Well, now we have the [ORG] [NORP] on [DATE] did come out with a plan to replace these cuts. It is [CARDINAL] spending cuts and [CARDINAL] tax revenue increases. What do you make of that [NORP] plan? Well, first of all I'd be curious to see if they could actually pass that, number [CARDINAL]. Number [CARDINAL], the president got his tax increases [DATE]. He got those higher revenues. He was able to tax higher income individuals. But taking tax loophole, what we have always advocated is necessary for tax reform, means you are going to close loopholes to fuel more spending not to reform the tax code. What is the goal that we are trying to achieve here? We want economic growth. We want job creation. We want people to go back to work. We want to prevent a debt crisis from hurting those who are the most vulnerable in society from giving us a [NORP]-like economy. In order to do that, you have got to get the debt and deficit under control and you have got to grow the economy. So if you take tax loopholes to fuel more spending, which is what they are proposing, then you are preventing tax reform, which we think is necessary, to end crony capitalism and to grow the economy. So very quickly, though, you are body... So that is why we think we need to cut spending to pay for this. But your bottom line. Yes, our bottom line is cut spending to pay for this, that is right. And you are saying no tax increases, period, to pay for this. That is a right, that is right because revenues, loopholes are necessary for tax reform. If you take them for spending, you are blocking tax reform and you are really not getting the deficit under control. OK, now, the next big thing here is you -- the speaker has said you were going to come out with a balanced budget that is going to balance the budget in [DATE]. Your last budget did not balance until well after [DATE]. So this is a wig, new step. Some in your own party are a little worried about this. [PERSON], [NORP] congressman from [GPE] said we are saying a [DATE] balance. That is tougher than the last [INTERVIEWED2] budget. There could be a significant number of [NORP] that say, I am not going there because it would be too dramatic. How are you going to balance the budget in [DATE]? What further things are you going to cut that you did not last time? Well, we will show you when we finish writing the budget. We have not literally finished writing it. We have just begun because we just now got our baseline. So I cannot answer the question since it is not a complete task. But I am very comfortable with the fact that we will pass this. I am very comfortable with the fact that we will produce a budget that balances. Our last budget balanced. It just balanced a little later. This one will balance on time because we have new numbers to work with from [ORG] that I think will make it easier for us to balance. And, look, the point also is this, we are producing a budget. We are going to be passing a budget.The [ORG] has not passed a budget for [DATE]. The president has never proposed ever to ever balance the budget. That is wrong. The reason we want to do this is not simply to make numbers ad up, we want to prevent a debt crisis, we want to grow the economy, we want to get people back to work in society and if we have a debt crisis, that is bad for our economy [DATE]. OK. And let us never forget we are robbing from future generations. We have got to address that. We are almost out of time. I have got to ask you about this new effort from [PERSON] to weed out what he is calling problem candidates and [NORP] primaries. [CARDINAL] conservative talk radio host said of this effort we are now at the point where you are almost better off in [ORG] being endorsed by [PERSON] than [PERSON]. He is the reverse [PERSON]. Now I might note, by the way, that [PERSON] has recently called you one of the most remarkable political talents in [GPE]. But putting that aside, do you think this is a good thing or a bad thing to have a, you know, big [GPE] power broker trying to get in there and meddle in [NORP] primaries? You know what, [PERSON], I do not even pay attention to this stuff. I am too busy trying to do my job. I am too busy rising to put a budget together a budget that balances, to grow the economy, to create opportunity, to get bipartisan immigration reform. I really do not pay attention to this. So I have no thoughts on the matter whatsoever. No thoughts whatsoever. OK, before you go you know I have to ask you about your future. There was an article in [ORG] by my friends [PERSON] and [PERSON] about your political future saying you are less inclined to run for president. And this quote caught my eye [INTERVIEWED1]will never say he is not running for president because the constant speculation carries too many advantages, said a longtime friend. He will keep answering the questions in a way that will keep nosy political reporters interested.: Now, [INTERVIEWED1]at risk of being a nosy political reporter here, is it true, are you considerably less likely now to run for president in [DATE]? Actually, [PERSON], you have known me a long time and the one thing you know about me is I do not play that game. I do not talk like that. So when you see these articles that are really not accurate, that is par for the course in [GPE] [DATE]. The point is this, I think the most important thing for me to do is do my job representing the first district of [GPE], trying to prevent a debt crisis, helping get a solution to the economy, to jobs, to getting our deficit and debt under control. That it me is my first priority. That is what I am focused on. Will I or will not I? I do not know. I literally do not know the answer to these questions about what is the best role for me to play to fix these problems for our country in the future. The point is I do not know the answer because I am just not putting a great deal of thought into it.I am not foreclosing any opportunity. I may or a I may not. I just do not know because right now we just had an election. We have got jobs to do. What bothers me is this permanent campaign the president has us in. We need to start thinking about doing our jobs after these elections than thinking about the next election. All right. That is the problem we have in [GPE]. Unfortunately we are out of time but I am going to take that as a definite maybe. Thank you very much, [INTERVIEWED2]. All right. Appreciate your time.", "discourse_type": 1}
